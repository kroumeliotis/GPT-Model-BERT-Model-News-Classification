underrated threat to the irs', body='donald trump has not been a big believer in tax collection when hillary clinton alleged he did not pay federal income taxes for years he responded that makes me smart treasury secretary mnuchin was less upfront about tax collection in his confirmation hearings secretary mnuchin confirmed his awareness of the consequences of budget cuts to the irs on revenue collection during his confirmation hearing with the senate finance committee noting in his prepared remarks it is likely that further cuts to the irs will indeed hamper our ability to collect revenue during the testimony mnuchin took his comments for the record one step further adding i can assure you that the presidentelect understands the concept of we add people we make money thats a very quick conversation with donald trump studies of irs revenue collection agree strongly with the treasury secretary on the opportunity to increase collection by funding enforcement initiatives indeed already lowhanging fruit in the form of additional government revenue collection is increasingly within reach in 2016 the collection of 100 of revenue cost only 35 cents down from 53 cents in 2010 according to the irs 2016 data book years of consecutive budget cuts to the irs have reduced agency staff by 17 percent since 2010 despite secretary mnuchins assurances and the cbos 2016 estimated return of between 120 and 900 per dollar of investment in various irs enforcement initiatives the presidents latest budget proposal would cut irs funding by 239 million the largest parts of that cut of approximately two percent likely equivalent to more than 35 percent after adjusting for inflation are directed towards enforcement efforts to weaken rather than bolster the irs present challenges to an already underresourced agency and opportunity to those who seek to find smart ways to avoid paying their federal income taxes relative to the drastic funding cuts that irs officials had feared or to the cuts proposed for some agencies and programs for example a 314 percent cut to the environmental protection agency and a 40 percent cut to job training programs the irs may seem comparatively unscathed however as discussed above the relationship between funding and expense is different for the irs as noted by current irs commissioner john koskinen essentially the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars if further weakening of irs funding doesnt do enough damage to the federal governments ability to collect revenue an even more worrisome possibility looms commissioner koskinen was appointed by president obama his last day in office is november 9th of this year less than five months from now who will replace koskinen and will the replacement be someone who survives a senate confirmation process in which trumps hidden tax returns and purported decades of audits becomes a major topic of discussion or instead will we witness the temporary appointment of an irs director focused on aiding trump and his allies rather than collecting revenue trumps selection of corporate lawyer keith noreika as acting director of the office of the comptroller of the currency occ has created a dangerous precedent which could be used to severely hamper attempts at irs modernization and enforcement noreika went directly from being a law firm partner to acting comptroller of the currency would trump appoint a trump organization accountant to become acting commissioner of the irs should the trump administration place a nonconfirmed acting director atop the irs an alreadystacked deck would further favor the privatesector parties aiming to get around collection additionally such an appointment would create an informational asymmetry as after up to 130 days as agency head or more theres very little enforcement behind rules around acting appointees the appointee could return to the privatesector with intimate knowledge of weaknesses in irs enforcement and in particular that temporary head could make a big headache go away from one very influential person hedge fund billionaire and breitbart investor robert mercer in a toolittle noticed mcclatchy piece last month it was reported that the internal revenue service is demanding a whopping 7 billion or more in back taxes from the worlds most profitable hedge fund whose bosss wealth and cyber savvy helped donald trump polevault into the white house the irs demand is hardly controversial as mercers renaissance technologies attempts to use an obviously problematic loophole to pretend thats its rapidfire trading constitutes long term investing that is taxed at a far lower rate since polling suggests that wealthy individuals escaping their tax bill are more likely to be considered unpatriotic than smart sticking a wrench in the gears of the irs seems outright treasonous so while continuing to monitor trumprussia we need to also seek to limit the damage

six states according to a report released in april by a consortium of think tanks by 2036 a dozen states will pass that mark at the same time the share of states whose electorates are more than fourfifths white is predicted to drop steadily from 23 in the next presidential election to only 11 by the year 2036 nationwide white voters without a college education are expected to make up a dwindling though still significant share of the eligible electorate dropping from 46 percent in the last presidential election to just 37 percent by the year 2036 the electorate is also aging with voters above the age of 65 making up an increasing slice the report titled states of change was produced the bipartisan policy center the brookings institution prri and the progressive center for american progress demographics are not destiny authors rob griffin ruy teixeira and william h frey write but steady and predictable changes to the electorate play an important role in defining the landscape of american elections the impact these changes have at the polls in 2020 and future elections depends both on which groups actually turn out to vote and how strongly traits like race and education hold together as voting blocs the report lays out more than 30 possible scenarios for upcoming elections in several voting patterns stay the same as in past elections with the only change coming from the overall makeup of the electorate generally as the electorate becomes more diverse that would shift the momentum increasingly toward democrats in future years but especially in the short term theres still room for variance for instance if the unusually high share of thirdparty voters in the last election return home to their parties in the next presidential contest but 2016s voting patterns are otherwise repeated by the 2020 electorate the country could end with an electoral college tie in other scenarios racial minorities begin to turn out at the same rate as white voters also likely a boon for democrats unless minority groups begin shifting toward the gop in still other versions of the future if white voters without college degrees swing further toward the gop the party could take a narrow popular vote victory and a comfortable electoral college win republicans can find immediate success by targeting noncollegeeducated whites but going forward as that group shrinks the party would eventually lose in the electoral college if the gop doesnt also reach out to hispanics and asians the report concludes they risk putting themselves into a box where they become ever more dependent on a declining white population particularly its older segment segments of the gop expressed those very concerns prior to president donald trumps victory following mitt romneys 2012 loss the partys autopsy argued that republicans needed to reach out to minorities and women to survive in 2015 discussing a previous years report on demographic change a pollster for republicans like sen marco rubio rfla argued that the party would need to attract a record percentage of minorities to win the presidency in 2016 in retrospect that alarm looks premature and as the most recent report finds the gop still has paths to victory that dont include a broader tent the underlying demographic shifts though would seem to constrict the partys options going forward taken together the states of change projections for the republican party are reasonably dire sean trende a senior election analyst for realclearpolitics noted in a review of the scenarios included in the report but he added later simply put if demographics were the overwhelming factor that many suggest they are then a candidate like trump ought not to have been able to win in the leastwhite electorate on record yet he did win and likely won in part as a reaction to these demographic changes a number of the reports scenarios end with republicans again winning the electoral college while failing to capture the popular vote another split of that kind could be demotivating for voters especially on the democratic side democratic pollster anna greenberg said at a recent panel discussing the report greenberg noted that shed heard from many young voters in postelection focus groups that they felt democratic participation was futile if you think your vote doesnt matter then why go out and vote the span of plausible scenarios in which a given party could pull off a presidential win also lays bare ongoing arguments within democratic and republican ranks about their parties futures for instance it raises the question to what extent democrats should focus on winning back white noncollegeeducated voters from the gop versus turning out young and minority voters who are already predisposed to vote democratic but are not guaranteed to show up at the ballot box ive always taken the view that political coalitions are like water balloons trende said at the same panel discussion you step down on one side and another side pops up and i think that is a real problem for the democrats going forward you can try to tend to various parts of the coalition but inevitably you have a message that dominates even as demographics seem to give democrats a growing advantage the report concludes winning the electoral college will likely require a delicate balancing act between the dual goals of intensifying their support among voters of color and improving their margins among white particularly white noncollegeeducated voters it really hits home the challenge for what the progressive narrative is for democrats greenberg said pointing to winning scenarios that wouldnt require the party to improve on hillary clintons 2016 numbers with workingclass whites you can easily win in the future solely on the votes of minority voters white collegeeducated voters especially women and not ever talk to the white working class so tactically thats a fine strategy but philosophically for the democratic party not such a fine strategy'}.

democratic party chairwoman martha laning and missouri democratic national committeeman curtis wylde likewise called on her to retroactively donate it and return the payment and nebraska democratic party chairwoman jane kleeb who supported sen bernie sanders ivt in the 2016 primary argued that clinton could also contribute the equivalent money to state democratic parties other dnc officials including atlarge member brian wahby and kansas democratic national committeeman chris reeves welcomed an inkind donation but stopped short of asking for it it would be a christian thing to do wahby said sanders office did not return a request for comment on whether the senator agrees nick merrill a clinton spokesman defended the price tag on thursday on the grounds that the dnc has already reaped far more than it paid for the email list in fundraising so far paying a rental fee for use of an email list is common practice and in this case the dnc has raised over 30 million with it an 1800 percent return on their investment merrill wrote in an email to fox news the dnc purchased the email list to own rather than renting its information merrill did not respond to a huffpost request for comment on calls to retroactively make the resources an inkind contribution and return the money already received xochitl hinojosa a dnc spokeswoman agreed that the dnc had gotten a return on our investment and more since obtaining all of the lists and data donna brazile forged the agreement between the clinton campaign and the dnc in february 2017 while she was serving as interim dnc chairwoman brazile who has been critical of how the clinton campaign treated the dnc said she believed the deal would help her successor as dnc chair inherit a party in good shape i felt that it was a fair bargain at the time she said the current dnc chairman tom perez has amended the payment schedule but the core of the accord how much the dnc would pay and what it would get in return remains in place according to hinojosa the dnc paid onward together 300000 in january and 135000 in every subsequent month according to federal election commission filings and information provided by the dnc thus far it has transferred 705000 to clintons group as of the end of this month that sum will have increased to 840000 the revelation of the sale of clinton campaign resources to the dnc has struck a nerve with some democratic officials because it exemplifies practices that they have criticized for years these democrats lament the transactional relationship of democratic standardbearers with the dnc and state parties which often have a harder time fundraising former president barack obama withheld his campaign email list entirely from the dnc during his first term using it instead to build his political group organizing for america later renamed organizing for action after obamas reelection in 2012 he initially allowed the dnc to use the list free of charge before formally donating it to the party body in 2015 officials from state parties who joined the clinton campaigns joint fundraising agreement during the 2016 election also complained that the campaign left state parties little funding to maintain their operations onward together which as a 501c4 political nonprofit is not required to disclose its financial data says it has distributed grants to 11 progressive groups including indivisible swing left run for something and color of change however there are many forms of political organizing that state parties unlike those groups are uniquely equipped to do for example state parties have historically played important roles in recruiting candidates for state and local office advising and funding those candidates and registering and turning out voters in downballot races another source of tension is what sanders allies see as a double standard being applied to the vermont senators famously successful campaign email list although sanders was not the democratic presidential nominee after the campaign many democrats called on sanders to turn over his list to the dnc sanders has declined to do so they werent saying bernie rent your list they wanted the list said jim zogby president of the arab american institute and a sanders appointee to the dncs unity and reform commission they said all candidates do this they turn it over to the party well now i find out that they dont zogby who refused to comment on the conduct of the clinton campaign was one of several reformers who pressed the unity commission to recommend the creation of a financial oversight committee at the dnc with full access to the partys budget data he hopes that the latest revelation will increase support among the dncs membership to approve the oversight committee and other financial transparency measures the entire dnc membership is due to vote on the proposals in august it is critical to the ultimate survival of the party as a viable institution zogby said'}.

below is a typical threeperson crew tbm1c avenger aircraft that saw combat during wwii project recover aims to locate as many mias as possible so that the us government may bring them home for a proper burial this recovery is another step closer towards project recovers goal of finding the final underwater resting places of all americans missing in action since world war ii stated dan friedkin who is chairman of the air force heritage flight foundation and provides financial backing for project recover every family member impacted by the loss of a service member deserves this type of closure the primary search region for missinginaction american aircraft and their crews centers around palau located in the pacific ocean east of the philippines and north of new guinea scripps institution of oceanography estimates that there are several dozen us aircraft and the remains of some 80 american mias in the area the bentprop project has focused on this endeavor for 20 years conducting historical and archival research to support yearly monthlong searches weve always limited ourselves to one area the republic of palau but thats only because theres a lot of missing aircraft there physician and bentprop founder scannon told the huffington post when we were thinking of a name the first thing that came to my mind was that i always see bent propellers at these crash sites we decided that it captured the tragedy and it just stuck the people involved with the bentprop project have individual backgrounds and skills in areas crossing over aviation archaeology history navigation photography and anthropology all necessary ingredients to look for and find these crash sites partnering with ucsd and the university of delaware in 2012 has made even more discoveries possible since we started jointly working together we found a total of six aircraft underwater and we have up to 10 mia associated with the crashes scripps oceanographer eric terrill told huffpost five of those are us aircraft one was a japanese airplane and several of those aircraft have mias associated with them many times targets are very apparent in the sonar imagery and others take a while to analyze the data to find the manmade objects terrill said sonar doesnt give us a clearcut picture especially a lot of these wrecks that dont necessarily look like an airplane once theyve broken up as the wings get torn off and the engines get pulled off yet even after 70 years terrill says seawater helps preserve the remains of those lost in action between dna techniques dental records and dog tags theres a number of different forensic tools that the us government has at their fingertips to do the identification process he explained pending final dna identification of the missing avenger crew members the families will be notified one only has to be with a family once the remains are returned to understand how important this is scannon said my initial thought was would the families even care but once i started meeting them i realized very quickly that families of mias never quit they never stop missing the person whos been taken out of their lives even more surprising is that second and third generation family members often have stronger feelings because they never met the person scannon described what its like when hes underwater and discovers a crash site for the first time it is an arresting momentalmost like a knee jerk i pull up and look at it and realize that we havent found just a historically interesting site but weve found the temporary tomb of americans whove been missing in action for a long long time it is a privilege to be there and a privilege to finally study and know what happened so that the families can understand the fate of their loved ones a whole bunch of different emotions crowd in all at once my pulse goes up im probably breathing faster than i should and just try to take in the moment the thing that somehow seals it for me is i try to find one part of the plane that is as close as i can get to where the crew was and i touch that and that moment of touching to me somehow seals the reality that im not just looking at it that its real i think it affects all of us that way certainly its a national responsibility to find and recover remains from our past wars added terrill its a great teaching moment to remind the american public about a lot of the sacrifices family members have made for me personally its been very humbling to take some of my trade craft from ocean science and ocean technology and apply it to this type

plan was simply a plan to plan and responders were left to make things up on the fly as oil gushed into the gulf barr said barr said the feds didnt have the knowhow to shut the well that expertise was expected to rest with the operator bp he said the government wasnt aware that bp had neither the experience nor procedures in place to stop the flow however barr said if bp had been prepared for a possible blowout the well could have been capped within days or weeks not months in his opening statement brad brian on behalf of transocean and the aligned parties said bp misrepresented the flow rate in april and may of 2010 delaying the wells capping bp repeatedly said 5000 barrels a day was its best flow estimate and withheld documents showing much higher rates the consequences of bps misrepresentations and concealment were bad decisions a false diagnosis of why the top kill sourcecontrol method they used failed and tragically the rejection in may of an alternative strategythe blowout preventer on blowout preventer that was ready to be installed and would have capped this well long before it was capped brian said a top kill attempt which involved pumping drilling mud to stop the wells flow failed in late may 2010 a bop is a safety device used to seal a well in january of this year bp pleaded guilty to withholding internal documents containing flow estimates that were well above 5000 barrels per day brian noted during the spill bp modelers sent possible flow rates of 110000 barrels per day and higher to their bosses in bp he said on may 10 2010 bp edited a chart in order to show a much lower worstcase scenario of the flow and inserted a most likely rate of 5000 barrels a day on may 16 2010 the unified command approved bps recommendation to do the top kill brian said the unified command included the us coast guard and a number of other federal agencies along with bp and transocean but within hours of that decision they learned from their outside consultant dr ole rygg at add energy that the top kill procedure they were contemplating wouldnt work if the well was flowing at 15000 barrels per day or higher brian said add energy based in norway with an office in houston was contracted by bp to assist in well control even after the top kill effort failed in may bp still wouldnt admit the size of its flow rate brian said bps false flow statements shaped the recovery effort and greatly delayed the wells capping he said in his opening statement monday don godwin for halliburton and the aligned parties also said bps lowballing of the wells flow and its lack

during the spill all of these people were dedicated to getting this well shut in as quickly as possible he said it defies common sense to say that we would delay by two months the shutin because we didnt want to say something about why top kill had failed underlying its spill response bp had several guiding principles brock said first dont take any action that makes matters worse he said youre going to see when we look at the decision about boponbop versus top kill versus other options like collection that this is a significant overriding principle the other principles were work options in parallel leave no stone unturned spare no expense he said brock said the 5000 barrelperday flow estimate came from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration everyone understood that there was significant uncertainty that went with that number he said federal scientists and technicians embedded in bps houston center were working closely with bp they were talking at the water cooler he said they were openly sharing data at that center brock said the feds werent misled and knew the flow rate could be over 15000 barrels per day before the topkill procedure was attempted ultimately the capping stack was utilized to seal the well on july 15 2010 brock said bp did not misrepresent flow rate in a way that caused a delay of the shutin it made reasonable engineering decisions based on what was known at each step along the way keeping in mind the principles of do no harm work all options in parallel leave no stone unturned thats not fraud thats not gross negligence a capping stack is a device used to shut off the flow from a well on monday new mexico institute of mining and technology professor john wilson under cross examination from hariklia karis on behalf of bp discussed some of the problems with bps having underestimated its flow if the flow rate is sufficiently high such that the momentum kill doesnt work that also suggests the flow rate is sufficiently high because theres not a lot of obstructions in the blowout preventer wilson said and if there are fewer obstructions in the bop theres less chance that the junk shot would succeed just by a matter of physics junk shots something bp tried in late may 2010 involve injecting golf balls shredded tires and other material to obstruct the flow of oil rob turlak who manages subsea engineering and wellcontrol systems for transocean worked on a boponbop installation plan to cap the well but it was delayed in may and then shelved in june under examination from attorney luis li on behalf of transocean and the aligned parties turlak said tuesday he never got an explanation about why bp scrapped the boponbop strategy on tuesday texas petroleum engineer edward ziegler an aligned parties expert witness on well control noted that bp admitted to having spent nothing on research and development for source plans if the company had developed such plans before the blowout the flow wouldnt have lasted so long he said you need a real plan immediately when the event starts ziegler said you have a well flowing out of control so you dont start having meetings and groups and trying things and different options you actually have a plan and you immediately do it he said bp considered various methods including an initial plan to use a bop on a bop then they changed that he said bp changed plans about which rigs to use in its wellcontrol operations by the time they put the actual capping device on the well in july of 2010 that was the sixth different device they had started on ziegler said bp could have placed a capping stack on the well on the seafloor in may monitored pressures and might have closed the well by midmay he said a capping device was readily available on transoceans discoverer enterprise drilling rig but a plan to use it was scrapped he said i heard the bp gentleman in the opening say there were so many uncertainties and so many unknowns and thats why bp couldnt do certain things ziegler said referring to brocks opening comments but you have to get the data and the way to get it is to put the cap on there with controlandflow equipment and obtain the data he said instead of worrying about it and fretting and wringing your hands for two months just do it immediately he said it was clear in july 2010 that the well had integrity but that could have been learned two months earlier on wednesday james dupree bps chief operating officer of resource development and technology testified about how the flow was stopped with a capping stack on july 15 2010 we monitored the pressure he said we eventually were convinced that no broach was ongoing we watched the sea floor so that there was no risk of a broach then we rigged up on the well and killed it by pumping mud down we pumped a large cement slug into the well and cemented the well from the base that process of installing the stack to cementing the base took 477 days on thursday iain adams managing director of wellengineering firm norwell in scotland and bps expert witness on response to the blowout said under examination from hariklia karis that a need to explore options consider data and peer reviews and mitigate risk extended the time it took to kill the well if a prebuilt capping stack had been installed the way the aligned parties suggested in a week or a couple of weeks you would have had to basically ignore the key risks of well integrity and installation vessels he said the threeram stack that killed the well in july 2010 couldnt have been deployed immediately after the blowout because risks had to be considered first he said in testimony tuesday uc berkeley engineering professor robert bea a catastrophic risk expert said that before the april 2010 accident bp estimated a macondo blowout could cost between one hundred million and one billion dollars while bea had predicted it would greatly exceed ten billion dollars end'}.

legislatures and to fight partisan gerrymandering in the last speech of the day at the center for american progress ideas conference where she was joined by many other rumored presidential contenders warren pledged the money as part of a multipronged effort to fix a crisis in our democracy that she said has been building since long before president donald trump took office the senior massachusetts senator identified control of state governments and the congressional redistricting process as key ways to fight republican efforts to infringe on voting rights she called on democrats to root out key gopled threats such as racist voterid laws early voting restrictions disenfranchisement of felons and partisan gerrymandering im doubling down on the importance of our voters state by state and i want to turn up the heat on gerrymandering she said according to the text of her prepared remarks im sending 175000 to organizations on the front lines trying to win back our legislatures and fight for fair redistricting democrats believe in a fair fight and making sure that districts arent drawn to cut out one party or the other is a critical first step she continued warren is splitting the cash among several democratic campaign committees and groups she is sending 8000 each to nine democratic legislature campaigns in states where democrats hope to pick up seats florida georgia maine new hampshire ohio pennsylvania south carolina texas and wisconsin she is also contributing 30000 each to the democratic legislative campaign committee a national party arm that helps elect democratic state lawmakers and the national democratic redistricting committee a group led by former attorney general eric holder that is devoted to fighting gopled partisan redistricting the remainder of the 175000 will be split among several nonprofit liberal resistance groups including forward majority a super pac devoted to electing democratic state lawmakers warren went further in her recommendations for restoring public faith in the idea in support of what she called the fundamental principle that every vote matters she proposed amending the constitution to establish an unquestioned unassailable nationally recognized right to vote and she would crack down on the influence of special interests through three major reforms requiring cabinet members agency heads and members of congress to divest themselves of assets that pose a conflict of interest with their policy work prohibiting presidents and those officials from lobbying after they leave their posts and barring corporations from providing multimilliondollar leave packages to executives so they can serve in government lets dismantle the broken system that lets rich donors and giant companies undermine democracy by buying their way in washington she declared her 175000 contribution is the latest in a series of moves by warren designed to elect democratic candidates and buttress the depleted partys presence across the country at a march fundraiser for the democratic national committee she announced a contribution of 250000 to the 50 state democratic parties as well as a 15000 donation to the dnc the strategy is an implicit attempt to redress barack obamas relative inattention to democratic party infrastructure while he was president he received criticism for creating organizing for action a separate political arm that skeptics believe deprived the party of muchneeded attention and resources during obamas two terms the party lost some 1000 state legislative seats forfeiting control of 27 state legislative chambers the timing of those losses which began with the 2010 midterm elections was especially harmful to the party because it enabled republicans to draw extraordinarily partisan congressional and legislative district boundaries that entrenched their advantages there is now a broad consensus among democrats that ignoring the importance of state legislatures was a mistake of historic proportions however a clear subtext of warrens address is her growing national political profile including rumored presidential ambitions warren who has made a name for herself as wall streets toughest foe in congress has emerged as a leading smalldollar fundraiser a large majority of the more than 27 million warren has raised since 2013 has been in increments of less than 200 according to an april analysis in the

committee this year and last warren has taken a special interest in promoting democrats with whom she has worked on her signature issue of financial industry regulation this election cycle she is

leaders may have to make a deal', body='washington with gop support for a farm bill wavering among moderates and conservatives republican leaders are facing a dilemma that may force them into a deal this week to at least temporarily kill a discharge petition on immigration or not house freedom caucus leaders emerged tuesday night with a plan for more than a dozen members to withhold support for the farm bill until leaders agreed to vote on the socalled goodlatte bill a hawkish immigration measure authored by bob goodlatte rva the chairman of the judiciary committee republican immigration advocates are using the goodlatte bill as a vehicle to get a vote on a plan addressing the deferred action on childhood arrivals immigration program that democrats would support but members of the freedom caucus seeing how close the chamber is to getting a vote on a democraticpreferred daca measure is using their leverage on the farm bill to secure a vote on the goodlatte bill to in their minds effectively kill the daca discharge petition and reset the clock on when gop moderates and democrats could get a vote on the issue the problem with this plan is that it isnt clear whether voting on goodlatte would kill the discharge petition discharge petitions are used to bypass leadership decisions on which bills get a vote and can bring a bill to the floor with a minimum of 218 signatures the current discharge petition is on a rule that would bring up goodlatte and a number of other immigration proposals although conservatives in the freedom caucus think dispensing with goodlatte would render the rule moot its possible that the republicans and democrats who support the discharge petition could change the rule the uncertainty over the gambit is adding to the shakiness of the farm bill as well as the goodlatte bill but gop leaders say they would like to avoid all these complications by voting on the goodlatte proposal only if it has the votes to pass the problem with that idea is that its author has shown little willingness to alter the legislation to make it more palatable to his fellow republicans and there may be a key number of republicans who would side with democrats for a solution for immigrants affected by daca these issues would normally be separate from the farm bill which reauthorizes certain farm subsidies for five years and provides money for food stamps but the freedom caucus wants to use the weak support for the farm bill as leverage nearly all democrats intend to vote against the farm bill and that coupled with at least a dozen moderate republicans signaling strong opposition to the bill and at least another dozen conservatives who understand the power they have to extract an immigration concession means republicans just dont have the votes and because moderates look far more immovable than conservatives on the farm bill the gop leadership is forced to deal with the representatives whose votes can be bought some republicans from new jersey and new york and possibly some from pennsylvania look poised to vote against the farm bill when its supposed to come up for a vote on friday no matter what and a smattering of other members could have problems too particularly if the right or wrong amendments are adopted or rejected that means gop leaders dont have the votes to pass the bill if more than a dozen conservatives oppose the legislation and with leadership stating its preference to avoid the discharge petition anyway gop aides said the clearest path to victory on the farm bill may be to just give conservatives what they want only that may change if the gambit to kill the discharge petition wouldnt work anyway what conservatives ultimately want is still up in the air freedom caucus chairman mark meadows rnc told reporters tuesday night that he wanted a vote on the goodlatte bill to happen concurrently with the farm bill so that leaders couldnt go back on their word but he also said he could give gop leaders some leeway if they promised to hold a vote say next week of course that was when meadows was under the belief that voting on goodlatte would at least delay the discharge petition now conservatives may regroup and think of a different ask but even if republicans reach a deal among themselves they may still have problems passing the farm bill there are still a significant number of moderates opposing the bill and there are likely a few conservatives who will vote no regardless of whether leadership cuts a deal particularly if theres no feasible agreement on immigration passage could come down to how many democrats support the bill and not many are expected to vote yes another potential issue concerns the republicans who support the discharge petition on wednesday those republicans seemed to be caught flatfooted by the freedom caucus gambit ileana roslehtinen rfla who told huffpost she is voting against the farm bill said she hadnt heard anything about conservatives trying to kill the discharge petition and mario diazbalart another proimmigration republican from florida said he was concentrating on appropriations though he said he supported the farm bill gop moderates could still band together to oppose the farm bill if their leadership worked out some mechanism to give conservatives what they want by somehow killing the discharge petition but there seems to be no organized effort to do that at the moment republicans have acknowledged that passing the farm bill with only gop votes would be difficult but they now find themselves negotiating against different factions of the conference the farm bill combines welfare for farmers and the much bigger supplemental nutrition assistance program which is commonly known as food stamps and is one of the federal governments biggest antipoverty programs it helps 40 million americans buy food every month most republicans in congress think there are too many people on the program who should be working instead and house speaker paul ryan rwis has said reforming snap would make it easier for employers to fill available jobs the bill would expand a snap work requirement which currently applies to recipients ages 18 to 49 who dont have minor children or disabilities to people in their 50s and parents of minors older than 6 there would be several exemptions but generally the requirement would be to work 20 hours a week or spend that amount of time in an approved activity such as enrollment in a government training program that the legislation would create the congressional budget office has estimated that the expanded work requirement would reduce enrollment by an additional 12 million people in 2028 with no policy change the office expects enrollment to decline by 8 million by then because of the improving economy but some moderates and almost all democrats see those changes as an assault on food stamps theres also a significant battle brewing over sugar subsidies in the farm bill some members from areas where sugar is grown want higher prices while companies using it to make products like candy and soda want cheaper sugar gop leaders believe they can find the right balance to ahem sweeten the bill for some republicans but they may end up ostracizing some members and further complicating the vote math'}.

and the federal government isnt exactly helping the trump administration just gave the green light to kill a fiduciary rule that would have required commissionbased brokers and insurance agents to disclose conflicts of interest and compelled them to recommend the lowestcost retirement plans to clients those rules were set to be phased in this spring but now they may be tossed into the recycler bad timing the latest certified financial planner board of standards survey suggests 60 percent of investors feel advisors put their companies interests first while only 12 percent think they put the clients interests first and 63 percent believe the current laws dont protect consumers from those who would take advantage of them or to put it less delicately a lot of financial advisors lie but how no fees when an advisor says there is no commission involved you should be leery says brent wilsey who runs the san diegobased wilsey asset management as much as you may hope most likely they are not going to do their job for free instead companies build a facade that makes it look like your investment is feefree but in reality they hide the fees by burying them deep into documents he adds in other words theres no such thing as free trust me i have a title that is perhaps the biggest lie says warren ward a columbus indbased financial advisor theres so much title confusion in the industry and its a confusion that unscrupulous advisors often take advantage of they are apparently free to call themselves pretty much anything advisor counselor wealth manager he adds ward is a certified financial planner a significant designation requiring the completion of multiple college courses and passing a twoday exam but the law allows his less studied colleagues to call themselves anything and in an industry thats already confusing thats enough to fool some investors look at these returns funny math is common among some financial advisers some advisers overstate compound interest for example its a prevalent egregious lie that never gets challenged says jordan wolff the chief savings officer for shrinkabill services a financial services firm the equation is something like this if you invest a over the course of b years you will earn c because the average rate of return of this fund or market is d but wait the problem with this equation is that no one can score that rate of return every year says wolff the math treats this as a consistent earning every year and thats not accurate did we forget to mention that few advisors will tell you an outright lie says kevin obrien president of peak financial services lies of omission are probably more common he adds how so many terms and fees are buried in difficulttoread prospectuses and you may not be able to decipher the true costs of some investments because of this nontransparency advisors may not be forthcoming unless clients specifically ask about the costs and how the investment is priced out he adds remember registered investment advisors and investment advisor representatives are required to act in a fiduciary role while registered representatives may earn a commission this investment has no risk theres no such thing as no risk says financial advisor ilene davis while a bond or cd may guarantee return of principal purchasing power loss is a risk not often discussed she says its ok to refer to such investments as lowrisk but to call them norisk investments is a lie if your advisor is telling you otherwise you might want to look elsewhere its do or die shady investment advisors love fear tactics if you dont act now the situation will change and you wont succeed says carol fabbri the managing partner of fair advisors an independent financial advisory firm your kids wont go to college youll eat cat food planning is not a drama or a reality television show she says it takes patience to succeed bad advisors push clients to make a decision because they are afraid of losing a sale not because the market is going to change if your advisor is scaring you maybe you have the wrong advisor how to avoid this by choosing the right advisor in the first place says james pollard a marketing consultant for the website theadvisorcoachcom interview multiple financial advisors he says its important to do this rather than just pick one especially since some advisors might not mesh well with your goals or personality interviewing several financial advisors will give you a better perspective on the right fit for you also pay attention to how your financial advisor discusses and approaches

the players and usa hockey over compensation and other forms of financial support exploded into a public battle on march 15 when the uswnt threatened to skip the international ice hockey federation womens world championship unless they made significant progress in talks with the federation the dispute threatened to leave the tournament without its host and defending champion the united states won the tournaments gold medal in 2016 and has won six of the last eight world championship gold medals overall the boycott centered on a lack of financial support for the womens team the players wanted better compensation from the federation which they said only provided small monthly stipends during a sixmonth olympic training period but otherwise did not pay the players during the other 3 12 years of each olympic cycle they also pointed to insufficient support for travel and marketing and what they saw as usa hockeys disparate support for mens and womens hockey at the development level while usa hockey spends 35 million annually on its national team program for boys they said girls receive no comparable support usa hockey disputed those claims and initially began seeking out replacement players to field a team in the tournament the boycott appeared near its end last monday when usa hockey officials met with nine players and the teams attorneys in philadelphia more than 10 hours of productive meetings left players feeling hopeful that a deal was close but the talks collapsed later in the week and usa hockey again extended invites to other players in hopes of placing a

an outsider kentucky dem found the inside track', body='update may 22 retired fighter pilot amy mcgrath won tuesdays democratic primary in kentuckys 6th congressional district defeating lexington mayor jim gray previously lexington ky amy mcgraths campaign for congress hadnt even officially started and it was already broke last june the former marine fighter pilot retired from the military to move home to kentucky and launch a political career mcgrath is everything a national democratic campaign official would want in a new candidate she is a woman and a veteran and while she isnt a small business owner her husband is still she struggled to win over democratic party insiders in kentucky and washington most of whom were waiting for jim gray the popular mayor of lexington to decide whether he would pursue kentuckys 6th congressional district seat instead so in july with a bit of money in the bank and desperation beginning to set in mcgraths campaign manager mark nickolas decided that he had to do something crazy he told mcgrath who hadnt yet unpacked from her move to dig her bomber jacket out of a box he took his fledgling candidate to lexingtons blue grass airport stood her in front of a fighter jet and told mark putnam the ad man who has made democratic candidates from missouri to wisconsin go viral to start filming the ad that resulted told a simple story as a child mcgrath begged her congressman to help overturn the militarys ban on women in combat to no avail but the pentagon reversed course when she was in high school she enrolled in the us naval academy joined the marines and became the first woman to ever fly an f18 fighter jet in combat mcgrath relates this anecdote over broll of soaring jets with a quick departure to point out that republicans want to take away kentuckians health care you could discern the message of the commercial all the way from paducah mcgrath is a woman and a fighter and she wont be deterred from achieving her goals when nickolas answered his cell phone on the morning of aug 1 2017 the day he planned to launch the ad the voice on the other end had bad news mcgrath had raised just 50000 so far the ad had cost 57000 her campaign was 7000 in the red and shed barely said hello i thought to myself did i just destroy her career nickolas said on the contrary over the next three days mcgrath became a national political sensation a symbol of the wave of democratic women running for office in the age of trump comedian sarah silverman called her a badass on twitter chelsea handler invited mcgrath to appear on her show more than 1 million people watched the video and money lots of money began rolling in mcgrath raised more than 340000 in the 72 hours after the commercial first aired what the ad didnt do however was win over national democrats namely the democratic congressional campaign committee or dccc which continued to recruit gray neither did it push gray out of the race when he finally declared his candidacy in december gray held according to mcgraths own internal polling a 40point lead but handshake by handshake mcgrath quickly narrowed the gap going into tuesdays primary she was either fast on grays heels or out in front depending on whose polling you believe and the dccc has quietly taken the position that either democratic hopeful will have a strong chance to beat republican incumbent rep andy barr in november ideologically speaking there is little daylight between mcgrath and gray the distinction between them lies mainly in affect and strategy with mcgrath continuing to push an outsider vs insider narrative of the primary even as she seemed to become at least some of the insiders preferred candidate while she may well lose her primary mcgraths campaign contains some lessons for a party desperate to flip districts like this one she unabashedly pandered to the sort of discontent that swept president donald trump into office but she took care to hitch it to issues like jobs and health care particularly to the efforts of her states senior senator republican mitch mcconnell to take health care away from over a quartermillion kentuckians grievance plus stuff stick that on your lawn sign the challenge facing mcgraths campaign was immediately evident for any visitor to her campaign office near the university of kentuckys campus in lexington her opponent had headquartered his 2016 campaign for rand pauls us senate seat out of the same office across the drive a small house still had a gray for us senate campaign sticker plastered on the front door and though mcgraths initial ad had garnered her national attention gray still seemed like an obvious frontrunner in the early months of the race he is the mayor of the districts biggest base of reliably democratic votes and oversees a city with a 3 percent unemployment rate he won the 19county area by three points in the senate race against paul and in a year when the dccc is going for broke trying to gain the 24 seats it needs to regain the house majority gray is a bit of a luxury a wealthy businessman in a marginally competitive district who has the ability to relieve financial pressure on the national party by selffinancing at least part of his campaign gray also comes with progressive bona fides a popular mayor whos transformed lexington he supported removing the citys confederate statues hes a smalltown kentuckian who helped turn his family business into a construction giant hes viewed favorably by 77 percent of primary voters he supports raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour and expanding obamacare he touts a record of targeting utility monopolies that would seem to fit neatly into the new democratic antitrust agenda a win in the primary and again in november would make him the first openly gay congressman in kentuckys history but what would ordinarily be a compelling biography instead became something of a liability in an election year that has thus far favored political outsiders especially when theyre women in virginia pennsylvania nebraska and beyond insurgent female candidates have knocked off more established opponents with strongeronpaper political resumes feeding off the sense that americans and especially democrats want a new generation of political leaders to emerge so what gray and national democrats saw as strengths mcgrath and her team instantly pegged as weaknesses without much room to differentiate herself on the issues mcgrath instead chose to paint gray as a favorite son of the national democratic establishment the handpicked choice of washington rather than of central kentucky i think people are hungry for new leaders and a new generation of leaders she said theyre tired of the old guard they want folks who arent handpicked the characterization isnt exactly accurate aside from the senate run grays entire political career has been spent on the lexington city council or in the mayors office and hes hardly been a prominent voice in statewide or national democratic politics but by playing up her status as an outsider a veteran a mother a woman three things she says there arent enough of in congress mcgraths narrative has taken hold nonetheless and her calls to shake up congress have resonated strongly against grays safer duller call to send some adult supervision to washington yet as mcgraths national profile grew after her first ad she remained relatively unknown and perhaps even a little suspect to kentucky voters a native of edgewood in northern kentucky shed never lived in the central part of the state and had only relocated to the district in june upon retiring from the us naval academy gray attempted to punch back on this point in the races closing days releasing an ad that hit mcgrath for only recently moving to kentucky but groups like votevets a nonprofit that promotes veteran candidates and their issues have slammed the ad as an attempt to swiftboat mcgraths campaign even before gray entered the race nickolas who had managed former rep ben chandlers d successful 6th district campaign in 2004 outlined an aggressive retail politicking strategy to get mcgrath in front of voters not just on tv but in their homes churches billboards and mailboxes nickolas who thought he was out of politics for good until chandler urged him to meet with mcgrath said he was instantly swayed by her grasp of the issues and the realities of politics which she had honed during stints working for rep susan davis dcalif in congress during her time in the military most of all he was impressed by her passion and he banked on his belief that if they had to chance to meet her kentucky voters would feel the same mcgrath meanwhile purchased ad space in every local newspaper in the district and published an editorial detailing why she had chosen to run now in 2018 and here in central kentucky she piggybacked off the popularity of the initial ad which gained her thousands of social media followers to hold qas with voters in the district that were broadcast on facebook she hit all 19 counties in her first few months in the race stumping across the region and spending hours even days in areas that had once been reliable democratic strongholds but have trended red for more than a decade in a district where democrats still hold a registration advantage she has pushed the message that the national party has abandoned its voters here the democrats here feel left behind by the national party she said the national party to them is washington dc they dont have the same values theyre led by san francisco and new york they dont see leaders from here or the midwest and theyre focused on the wrong things led by san francisco and new york you dont need a decoder pin to understand what mcgrath is getting at but she goes no further she doesnt counterpose issues of identity transgender access to bathrooms womens rights race against the economic concerns of white workingclass voters mcgrath is prochoice shes a vocal critic of trumps efforts to ban transgender people from the military she thinks his effort to ban refugees and immigrants from majority muslim countries is discriminatory and misguided mcgrath doesnt shy away from those issues when voters bring them up and she believes her military service helps bridge the gap between the two sides when they do disagree but shes primarily focused on what she sees as the concerns that the districts oldschool democrats whove been voting republican still share with the national party chiefly health care and the economy she has argued for not just protecting the affordable care act but expanding it to include a public option and a lower age of eligibility for medicare against the republican tax cut package for which incumbent barr voted and for raising the minimum wage she describes herself as a fiscal conservative but mostly to score points off of barr for passing deficitfattening tax cuts after years of fearmongering on that very same issue and in a direct appeal to the rural parts of the district shes advocated for an expansive role for the federal government arguing that it should invest heavily in broadband infrastructure and job and economic development in areas left behind by the decline of manufacturing and the collapse of the coal industry we ought to have the federal government funding highspeed broadband in those areas and we ought to do it for our country mcgrath argued during an interview in her lexington campaign office eisenhower didnt say lets let private industry build the highways no the government did that and it powered our country fdr brought electricity to appalachia the federal government did that mcgrath speaks in a folksy unpolished manner with the occasional curse word slipping out her voice rising and falling and sometimes cracking as she talks about the ugly direction the country she fought for has taken or about barrs vote to repeal the health care law that gave thousands of local residents coverage for the first time the average household income here in kentucky is about 50000 thats not a lot she said when you have andy barr coming in and saying im going to repeal obamacare and give you health savings accounts dude they dont have the money for health savings accounts the more kentuckians have gotten to see of mcgrath the more the message shes aiming for has set in a lot of people say they want to shake things up shes believable in that regard just because of her demeanor said al cross a veteran kentucky political journalist she comes across as somebody who wants to get things done and wont take no for an answer that invocation of franklin delano roosevelt meanwhile isnt an accident it was the new deal and the local economic populists who supported it like former kentucky sen and vice president alben barkley who painted the state blue a century ago in a state where democrats have continually lost ground over the last decade mcgrath is arguing that we have to talk about the things that made these people democrats in the first place cross said fdr is the guy who confirmed people as democrats and alben barkley did too and its been a long time since either of those guys were around even before the polls began to shift there were signs that the strategy was working last fall mcgrath traveled to anderson county one of the districts largest counties to meet with ben carlson the conservative editor of the local daily newspaper the anderson news carlson was impressed not just by mcgrath but by the enthusiasm people had about her i havent sensed in a congressional race this kind of enthusiasm for a candidate in the 12 years ive been running the paper for either party carlson said shes brought that kind of excitement to it to nickolas thats evidence that this sort of hyperlocal campaigning in districts where voters increasingly feel detached from both sides of the national debate can help democrats win back seats i think its a reminder that sometimes we get away from the fundamentals nickolas said we get seduced by the latest way of communicating too many campaigns put their money on tv and digital and what suffers is the old school facetoface communication with voters mcgraths style of campaigning nickolas believes is crucial for democrats in purplish districts like kentuckys 6th the grievance gets peoples attention the stuff gets their votes they want to know are you going to go to congress and represent me are you going to care about me nickolas said she leads with that we may not agree on some of the issues but you should believe that im going to have your back he continued you can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas as long as those rural voters get a sense that youll fight for them'}.

was dark and cold that night i stomped down broadway talking to my thenboyfriendnowhusband about my feelings i am always talking about my feelings and he is always listening he mhms at the right places and doesnt interrupt and sometimes says good things at the end sometimes he says wrong things and then i have to explain why those things are wrong taking us down an emotional tangent that is frustrating and exhausting but hes trying to be helpful i tell myself and breathe bless his little heart but tonight he lets me talk and i do filling the minutes with long twisting sentences that make sense to me but as they tumble out im not sure that they do so i pause and i blurt im just not a white man or something like that this was years ago so who knows what really happened i may not have been on broadway at all but thats where the anger ended in not being white or a man or coding since i was two or some combination of the three this wasnt going to work coding wasnt going to work i didnt belong fastforward three years id choked down my feelings and learned to code and built things and knew stuff that even my thenboyfriendnowhusband didnt know we sat on our couch one evening while i explained how ajax worked he leaned back and i leaned in excited and trembling at the edge of my seat i heard the words coming out of my mouth watched them float in the air between us blooming with buzzwords and jargon and pride and i burst into tears i covered my face with my hands hunched over and shook i couldnt believe i understood the words i was saying this was going to work coding was going to work maybe i did belong the cracks in that newly laid confidence would soon come but not for reasons i may have lead you to believe i apologize if you assumed this was a story about a difference rooted in race and gender because it is not thats not where we are going this is about a difference of values beliefs perspectives i wanted so badly to think like a programmer which implies that the way i think is wrong it needed fixing in many ways this observation is frustratingly fuzzy cloudy unfocused but ive squeezed it hard enough to make raindrops something i can taste and feel and i shall give you three i am not solutionoriented i dont see a problem and get giddy at the idea of solving it patching it up and sending it on its merry way i want to poke it and ask it questions where did it come from what is it doing whats its story i want to take it to tea and hear about its life and understand it to its core and if at that point ive come to a wholistic understanding and am able to solve the problem by all means let the problemsolving commence but my instinct is never to solve but to understand this is the part where you tell me that this is a great asset in a programmer that all programmers would be much better off if they took the time to understand before diving in my thinking isnt broken at all you say its super awesome thats cute and truly i appreciate your defense of my broken brain but no matter what medium blog posts tell you how crucial it is to understand the problem before coding its solution this is at best an annoying part of an average developers job and more likely a distant idea that is happily ignored developers solve problems it is the problemsolving not the problemunderstanding that gets you high hm maybe this isnt going to work i am not comfortable making halfass shit once in a while i look up the famous quote by reid hoffman cofounder of linkedin who said if you arent embarrassed by the first version of your product you shipped too late i say it to myself i say it again i let it sit and turn it over and convince myself this isnt insane i understand this concept at an intellectual level i get the value of the mvp minimum viable product and was excited to learn the pseudoscientific process of the lean methodology the quote is a punchy way of encouraging product creators to start small and test an idea before investing loads of money and time in an expensive mistake and this advice is great you should start small and test and learn but the way this advice manifests itself is often in writing shitty shit that makes shitty shit products and leaving it in its shitty shit way its the shrug that accompanies the mindless defense but it works it produces a mentality of doing the absolute bare minimum not because its whats best for the product or your team but because why bother to do more it works it condemns everything ive learned and loved about craftsmanship and quality and just plain giving a fuck there are no as here there is only pass and fail maybe coding wasnt going to work this is the part where you tell me that there is such a thing as beautiful code there are talks that preach the value of well written code books filled with advice on how to hone your craft podcast interviews of developers raging against poorly written programs my value of quality is wonderful you say do not fix it you shout keep going you plead thats cute but no matter how many conference talks youve tweeted about praising code as craft open up your companys productionlevel app right now and tell me how much of that has made its way to your product dont worry ill wait because in the real world of death marches limited runway and just plain old pressure from the higher ups quality and care are a dream sweet distant and rarely realized but perhaps the biggest way that my brain is broken is less about code and more about the tech industry as a whole if youre thinking to yourself but everyone uses tech so everything is the tech industry please sit tight while i take a moment to roll my eyes ok im back for our purposes lets define tech industry as companies and professionals who view code as a core part of their business and their selfunderstanding both internally and externally when i was at npr years ago i did a story on public education in california i dont remember the angle but i remember looking up a stat to use in the script i used that stat in a few places and after factchecking i realized there was an updated number available i went back and changed the references to the new number relieved that id caught this mistake before handing over my script to the host but i missed one i heard it over the speakers when michelle martin the host read it out loud during the interview and my heart stopped i knew it was my duty to report it so i went up to my editor and told her she didnt say anything but i could feel her disappointment in me i melted into a pool of shame but heres the thing no one will ever remember that number no one remembers it now and im sure no one noticed it when it happened but i knew it happened that it was an easily preventable mistake and in journalism being wrong in that way is absolutely unacceptable so imagine my surprise when i first heard of fail fast and break things one of the famous tech mantras for product creation imagine my shock to find out that being wrong is not reprimanded but at times encouraged imagine my confusion stepping into a world where people are told to just try it and see i tell myself over and over that this is different that this is good that public experimentation is not a holy sin ive managed to convince myself when im not busy quieting a nauseous tummy tormented by public broken attempts and shameful failures but here i will admit defeat being wrong in software is fundamentally different from being wrong in reporting except when its not when i use your product im trusting you i believe you when you tell me that clicking that button will create my profile that i am indeed submitting an email by hitting enter that i will see my moms message when i click on her little round face my belief in you is delicate and deep do not take my trust for granted do not take advantage of me we are in a relationship you and i distant and faceless yes but a relationship nonetheless i give and you take and you give and i take and i believe your words your lines your interfaces it should be precious it should be handled with care but the carelessness i see in tech is unsettling the willful ignorance the rejection of our relationship hurts it might come big like playing with my emotions by purposefully filling my feed with sad or happy content just to see how i respond it might come small like your claim of being the number one thisandthat in your thisandthat field according to no one you are so proud of your accomplishments and so comfortable in your grandeur that you forget to be honest with me sometimes it comes deep like spending months together trying to solve a problem you promised me you could solve to later find out that you got it all wrong you made it all up you have no idea what youre doing you brag about this in your interviews and inevitable autobiography for some strange reason you wear this ignorance as a badge of honor you failed fast and broke my heart but you will never see it that way youre too excited i feel you whisper make the world a better place as you drift to sleep so obsessed with changing it that you forget that the world is made up of little people like me you are experimenting trying new things and for this you are great and lean but sometimes you forget that im at the center of your experiments sometimes you forget me i take these relationships seriously so seriously that often im immobilized and overwhelmed and in those moments you push products im too uncomfortable to push and you win you get there first making waves while i sit in last place and watch so i choke down my values and discomfort and attempt a push of my own amid the internal screams that this is wrong and irresponsible and how dare i i dont get very far my feeble halfhearted steps cannot compete with your bold proud strides so i cower back to my corner with my broken brain and peep at your success through the leaves i do not belong my values are not valued my thinking is strange and foreign my world view has no place here it is not that i am better it is that i am different and my difference feels incompatible with yours dear tech so i will mark my corner a small plot of land and stand firmly here trying to understand you and reconcile these conflicting differences maybe i will change maybe youll surprise me maybe one day ill belong'}.

military takes us through the gates of hell', body='this article originally appeared at tomdispatchcom to receive tomdispatch in your inbox three times a week click here by tom engelhardt this essay is the introduction to tom engelhardts new book a nation unmade by war a dispatch book published by haymarket books as i was putting the finishing touches on my new book the costs of war project at brown universitys watson institute published an estimate of the taxpayer dollars that will have gone into americas war on terror from september 12 2001 through fiscal year 2018 that figure a cool 56 trillion including the future costs of caring for our war vets on average thats at least 23386 per taxpayer keep in mind that such figures however eyepopping are only the dollar costs of our wars they dont for instance include the psychic costs to the americans mangled in one way or another in those neverending conflicts they dont include the costs to this countrys infrastructure which has been crumbling while taxpayer dollars flow copiously and in a remarkably in these years almost uniquely bipartisan fashion into whats still laughably called national security thats not of course what would make most of us more secure but what would make them the denizens of the national security state ever more secure in washington and elsewhere were talking about the pentagon the department of homeland security the us nuclear complex and the rest of that statewithinastate including its many intelligence agencies and the warrior corporations that have by now been fused into that vast and vastly profitable interlocking structure in reality the costs of americas wars still spreading in the trump era are incalculable just look at photos of the cities of ramadi or mosul in iraq raqqa or aleppo in syria sirte in libya or marawi in the southern philippines all in ruins in the wake of the conflicts washington set off in the post911 years and try to put a price on them those views of mile upon mile of rubble often without a building still standing untouched should take anyones breath away some of those cities may never be fully rebuilt and how could you even begin to put a dollarsandcents value on the larger human costs of those wars the hundreds of thousands of dead the tens of millions of people displaced in their own countries or sent as refugees fleeing across any border in sight how could you factor in the way those masses of uprooted peoples of the greater middle east and africa are unsettling other parts of the planet their presence or more accurately a growing fear of it has for instance helped fuel an expanding set of rightwing populist movements that threaten to tear europe apart and who could forget the role that those refugees or at least fantasy versions of them played in donald trumps fullthroated successful pitch for the presidency what in the end might be the cost of that opening the gates of hell americas neverending twentyfirstcentury conflicts were triggered by the decision of george w bush and his top officials to instantly define their response to attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center by a tiny group of jihadis as a war then to proclaim it nothing short of a global war on terror and finally to invade and occupy first afghanistan and then iraq with dreams of dominating the greater middle east and ultimately the planet as no other imperial power had ever done their overwrought geopolitical fantasies and their sense that the us military was a force capable of accomplishing anything they willed it to do launched a process that would cost this world of ours in ways that no one will ever be able to calculate who for instance could begin to put a price on the futures of the children whose lives in the aftermath of those decisions would be twisted and shrunk in ways frightening even to imagine who could tote up what it means for so many millions of this planets young to be deprived of homes parents educations of anything in fact approximating the sort of stability that might lead to a future worth imagining though few may remember it ive never forgotten the 2002 warning issued by amr moussa then head of the arab league an invasion of iraq would he predicted that september open the gates of hell two years later in the wake of the actual invasion and the us occupation of that country he altered his comment slightly the gates of hell he said are open in iraq his assessment has proven unbearably prescient and one not only applicable to iraq fourteen years after that invasion we should all now be in some kind of mourning for a world that wont ever be it wasnt just the us military that in the spring of 2003 passed through those gates to hell in our own way we all did otherwise donald trump wouldnt have become president i dont claim to be an expert on hell i have no idea exactly what circle of it were now in but i do know one thing we are there the infrastructure of a garrison state if i could bring my parents back from the dead right now i know that this country in its present state would boggle their minds they wouldnt recognize it if i were to tell them for instance that just three men bill gates jeff bezos and warren buffett now possess as much wealth as the bottom half of the us population of 160 million americans they would never believe me how for instance could i begin to explain to them the ways in which in these years money flowed ever upward into the pockets of the immensely wealthy and then down again into what became onepercent elections that would finally ensconce a billionaire and his family in the white house how would i explain to them that while leading congressional democrats and republicans couldnt say often enough that this country was uniquely greater than any that ever existed none of them could find the funds some 56 trillion for starters necessary for our roads dams bridges tunnels and other crucial infrastructure this on a planet where what the news likes to call extreme weather is increasingly wreaking havoc on that same infrastructure my parents wouldnt have thought such things possible not in america and somehow id have to explain to them that they had returned to a nation which though few americans realize it has increasingly been unmade by war by the conflicts washingtons war on terror triggered that have now morphed into the wars of so many and have in the process changed us such conflicts on the global frontiers have a tendency to come home in ways that can be hard to track or pin down after all unlike those cities in the greater middle east ours arent yet in ruins though some of them may be heading in that direction even if in slow motion this country is at least theoretically still near the height of its imperial power still the wealthiest nation on the planet and yet it should be clear enough by now that weve crippled not just other nations but ourselves in ways that i suspect though ive tried over these years to absorb and record them as best i could we can still barely see or grasp in my new book a nation unmade by war the focus is on a country increasingly unsettled and transformed by spreading wars to which most of its citizens were at best only half paying attention certainly trumps election was a sign of how an american sense of decline had already come home to roost in the era of the rise of the national security state and little else though its not something normally said here to my mind president trump should be considered part of the costs of those wars come home without the invasions of afghanistan and iraq and what followed i doubt he would have been imaginable as anything but the host of a reality tv show or the owner of a series of failed casinos nor would the garrisonstate version of washington he now occupies be conceivable nor the generals of our disastrous wars whom hes surrounded himself with nor the growth of a surveillance state that would have staggered george orwell the makings of a blowback machine it took donald trump give him credit where its due to make us begin to grasp that we were living in a different and devolving world and none of this would have been imaginable if in the aftermath of 911 george w bush dick cheney co hadnt felt the urge to launch the wars that led us through those gates of hell their soaring geopolitical dreams of global domination proved to be nightmares of the first order they imagined a planet unlike any in the previous half millennium of imperial history in which a single power would basically dominate everything until the end of time they imagined that is the sort of world that in hollywood had been associated only with the most malign of evil characters and here was the result of their conceptual overreach never it could be argued has a great power still in its imperial prime proven quite so incapable of applying its military and political might in a way that would advance its aims its a strange fact of this century that the us military has been deployed across vast swaths of the planet and somehow again and again has found itself overmatched by underwhelming enemy forces and incapable of producing any results other than destruction and further fragmentation and all of this occurred at the moment when the planet most needed a new kind of knitting together at the moment when humanitys future was at stake in ways previously unimaginable thanks to its stillincreasing use of fossil fuels in the end the last empire may prove to be an empire of nothing at all a grim possibility which has been a focus of tomdispatch the website ive run since november 2002 of course when you write pieces every couple of weeks for years on end it would be surprising if you didnt repeat yourself the real repetitiousness however wasnt at tomdispatch it was in washington the only thing our leaders and generals have seemed capable of doing starting from the day after the 911 attacks is more or less the same thing with the same dismal results again and again the us military and the national security state that those wars emboldened have become in effect and with a bow to the late chalmers johnson a tomdispatch stalwart and a man who knew the gates of hell when he saw them a staggeringly wellfunded blowback machine in all these years while three administrations pursued the spreading war on terror americas conflicts in distant lands were largely afterthoughts to its citizenry despite the largest demonstrations in history aimed at stopping a war before it began once the invasion of iraq occurred the protests died out and ever since americans have generally ignored their countrys wars even as the blowback began someday they will have no choice but to pay attention

humanity', body='2016 was an incredible year for technology and for humanity despite all the negative politicalrelated news there were 10 tech trends this year that positively transformed humanity for this 2017 kickoff blog i reviewed 52 weeks of science and technology breakthroughs and categorized them into the top 10 tech trends changing our world im blown away by how palpable the feeling of exponential change has become im also certain that 99999 percent of humanity doesnt understand or appreciate the ramifications of what is coming in this blog enjoy the top 10 tech trends of the past 12 months and why they are important to you note at the end of this blog i provide a detailed reference for all of the new items below lets dive in in 2010 18 billion people were connected today that number is about 3 billion and by 2022 2025 that number will expand to include every human on the planet approaching 8 billion humans unlike when i was connected 20 years ago at 9600 baud via aol the world today is coming online at 1 megabit per second or greater with access to the worlds information on google access to the worlds products on amazon access to massive computing power on aws and artificial intelligence with watson not to mention crowdfunding for capital and crowdsourcing for expertise looking back at 2016 you can feel the acceleration here are seven stories that highlight the major advances in our race for global connectivity a googles 5g solar drones internet service project skybender is googles secretive 5g internet drone initiative news broke this year that they have been testing these solarpowered drones at spaceport america in new mexico to explore ways to deliver highspeed internet from the air their purported millimeter wave technology could deliver data from drones up to 40 times faster than 4g b facebooks solar drone internet service even before google facebook has been experimenting with a solarpowered drone also for the express purpose of providing internet to billions the drone has the wingspan of an airliner and flies with roughly the power of three blowdryers c viasat plans 1 terabit internet service viasat a usbased satellite company has teamed up with boeing to launch three satellites to provide 1 terabitpersecond internet connections to remote areas aircraft and maritime vehicles viasat is scheduled to launch its satellite viasat2 in early 2017 d oneweb raises 12b for 900 satellite constellation an ambitious lowearth orbit satellite system proposed by my friends greg wyler paul jacobs and richard branson just closed 12 billion in financing this 900satellite system will offer global internet services as soon as 2019 e musk announces 4425 internet satellite system perhaps the most ambitious plan for global internet domination was proposed this year by spacex founder elon musk with plans for spacex to deploy a 4425 lowearth orbit satellite system to blanket the entire planet in broadband weve just exceeded a historic inflection point 2016 was the year solar and renewable energy became cheaper than coal in december the world economic forum reported that solar and wind energy is now the same price or cheaper than new fossil fuel capacity in more than 30 countries as prices for solar and wind power continue their precipitous fall twothirds of all nations will reach the point known as grid parity within a few years even without subsidies they added this is one of the most important developments in the history of humanity and this year marked a number of major milestones for renewable energy heres 10 data points stories ive handpicked to hammer home the historic nature of this 2016 achievement a 25 percent of the worlds power comes from renewables ren21 a global renewable energy policy network published a report showing that a quarter of the worlds power now comes from renewable energy international investment in renewable energy reached 286 billion last year with solar accounting for over 160b of this and its accelerating b in india solar is now cheaper than coal an amazing milestone indeed and india is now on track to deploy 100 gigawatts of solar power by 2022 c the uk is generating more energy from solar than coal for the first time in history this year the uk has produced an estimated 6964 gwh of electricity from solar cells 10 percent higher than the 6342 gwh generated by coal d coal plants being replaced by solar farms the nanticoke generating station in ontario once north americas largest coal plant will be turned into a solar farm e coal will never recover the coal industry once the backbone of us energy is fading fast on account of renewables like solar and wind official and expert reports now state that it will never recover eg coal power generation in texas is down from 39 percent in early 2015 to 248 percent in may 2016 f scotland generated 106 percent energy from wind this year high winds boosted renewable energy output to provide 106 percent of scotlands electricity needs for a day g costa rica ran on renewables for 2 months the country ran on 100 percent renewable energy for 76 days h google to run 100 percent on renewable energy google has announced its entire global business will be powered by renewable energy in 2017 i city of las vegas meets goal of 100 percent power by renewables las vegass city government now runs entirely on renewable energy j teslas gigafactory teslas 5 billion structure in nevada will produce 500000 lithium ion batteries annually and teslas model iii vehicle it is now over 30 percent complete the 10 million square foot structure is set to be done by 2020 musk projected that a total of 100 gigafactories could provide enough storage capacity to run the entire planet on renewables though it may seem hard to believe the end of cancer and disease is near scientists and researchers have been working diligently to find novel approaches to combating these diseases and 2016 saw some extraordinary progress in this regard here are my top 10 picks that give me great faith about our abilities to cure cancer and most diseases a cancer immunotherapy makes strides extraordinary results immunotherapy involves using a patients own immune system in this case t cells to fight cancer doctors remove immune cells from patients tag them with receptor molecules that target the specific cancer and then infuse the cells back in the body during the study 94 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all saw symptoms vanish completely patients with other blood cancers had response rates greater than 80 percent and more than half experienced complete remission b in china crisprcas9 used in first human trial a team of scientists in china sichuan university became the first to treat a human patient with an aggressive form of lung cancer with the groundbreaking crisprcas9 geneediting technique c nih approves human trials using crispr a team of physicians at the university of pennsylvanias school of medicine had their project of modifying the immune cells of 18 different cancer patients with the crisprcas9 system approved by the national institute of health results are tbd d giant leap in treatment of diabetes from harvard for the first time harvard stem cell researchers created insulin producing islet cells to cure diabetes in mice this offers a promising cure in humans as well e hiv genes cut out of live animals using crispr scientists at the comprehensive neuroaids center at temple university were able to successfully cut out the hiv genes from live animals and they had over a 50 percent success rate f new treatment causes hiv infected cells to vanish a team of scientists in the uk discovered a new treatment for hiv the patient was treated with vaccines that helped the body recognize the hivinfected cells then the drug vorinostat was administered to activate the dormant cells so they could be spotted by the immune system g crispr cures mice of sickle cell disease crispr was used to completely cure sickle cell by editing the errant dna sequence in mice the treatment may soon be used to cure this disease which affects about 100000 americans h eradicating measles in the us the world health organization who announced that after 50 years they have successfully eradicated measles in the us this is one of the most contagious diseases around the world i new ebola vaccine proved to be 100 percent effective none of the nearly 6000 individuals vaccinated with rvsvzebov in guinea a country with more than 3000 confirmed cases of ebola showed any signs of contracting the disease j eradicating polio the world health organization has announced that it expects to fully eradicate polio worldwide by early 2017 i am personally convinced that we are on the verge of significantly impacting human longevity at a minimum making 100 years old the new 60 as we say at human longevity inc this year hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into research initiatives and companies focused on extending life here are five of the top stories from 2016 in longevity research a 400yearold shark discovered a greenland shark that could have been over 400 years old was discovered this year making the species the longestlived vertebrate in the world b genetically reversing aging with an experiment that replicated stem celllike conditions salk institute researchers made human skin cells in a dish look and behave young again and mice with premature aging disease were rejuvenated with a 30 percent increase in lifespan the salk institute expects to see this work in human trials in less than 10 years c 25 percent life extension based on removal of senescent cells published in the medical journal nature cell biologists darren baker and jan van deursen have found that systematically removing a category of living stagnant cells can extend the life of mice by 25 percent d funding for antiaging startups jeff bezos and the mayo clinicbacked antiaging startup unity biotechnology with 116 million the company will focus on medicines to slow the effects of agerelated diseases by removing senescent cells as mentioned in the article above e young blood experiments show promising results for longevity sakura minami and her colleagues at alkahest a company specializing in bloodderived therapies for neurodegenerative diseases have found that simply injecting older mice with the plasma of young humans twice a week improved the mices cognitive functions as well as their physical performance this practice has seen a 30 percent increase in lifespan and increase in muscle tissue and cognitive function ive increasingly become confident and passionate about stem cells the regenerative engine of the body to help cure disease and extend the healthy human lifespan i previously wrote about stem cells and the incredible work from dr robert bob hariri here below are my top three stories demonstrating the incredible research and implications for stem cells in 2016 a stem cells able to grow new human eyes biologists led by kohji nishida at osaka university in japan have discovered a new way to nurture and grow the tissues that make up the human eyeball the scientists are able to grow retinas corneas the eyes lens and more using only a small sample of adult skin b stem cell injections help stroke victims walk again in a study out of stanford of 18 stroke victims who agreed to stem cells treatments seven of them showed remarkable motor function improvements this treatment could work for other neurodegenerative conditions such as alzheimers disease parkinsons and lou gehrigs disease c stem cells help paralyzed victim gain use of arms doctors from the usc neurorestoration center and keck medicine of usc injected stem cells into the damaged cervical spine of a recently paralyzed 21yearold man three months later he showed dramatic improvement in sensation and movement of both arms 2016 was definitely the year of the autonomous vehicle as google tesla and uber lead the charge almost every major car company is investing heavily in autonomy this will be one of the defining technology developments of the decade soon we may well look back in shock that we ever let humans drive cars on their own in looking back at the last 12 months here are the top nine developments in selfdriving cars a autonomous uber operational in pittsburgh ubers selfdriving autonomous cars began picking up passengers in pittsburgh this year they also attempted a rollout in san francisco b ubers

groups reported finding potentially toxic levels of phthalates in spongebob squarepants vinyl rain ponchos and flame retardants in toys r us furniture and lets not forget the neurotoxic lead and other chemicals that leach from some fake plastic christmas trees despite growing recognition of toxic dangers that may lurk in consumer products avoiding these chemicals is another story advocates continue to lament weak and outdated federal regulation of toxic chemicals even though they cheer incremental gains such as californias announcement last week that furniture manufacturers will no longer be required to fill their foam with flame retardants starting in january the controversial chemicals are the subject of an awardwinning chicago tribune series and a documentary toxic hot seat which premiered monday on hbo in light of this news people with furniture on their holiday shopping lists may want to consider gifting an iou right now the dangers are invisible unlabeled and a consumer has no basis for making a reasonable and healthprotected choice said john wargo an environmental health expert at yale university the onus is on the consumer who needs to do research product by product he added people dont have time for that and often opt for buying whatever is available some environmental groups are now attempting to make navigating around toxic chemicals easier for concerned shoppers with a fleet of new consumer guides and mobile apps a website launched in september safemarketsorg provides information tips and resources such as healthystufforgs database of more than 5000 tested consumer products the new site from the workgroup for safe markets a collaboration of environmental groups links to other sites including a new nontoxic shopping guide published by womens voices for the earth and greenpeaces electronics buying guide an increasing number of tools are also available for shoppers on the go mobile productrating apps from the good guide and the nonprofit environmental working group allow users to simply scan a barcode the latter launched in midnovember offers iphone and android versions of its skin deep database which contains data on about 80000 cosmetic and personal care products a lot of people are surprised when they start scanning said heather white executive director of the environmental working group the average american uses 10 to 12 personal care products a day totaling some 126 different ingredients among the most critical ingredients to avoid due to their hormonemimicking cancercausing antibioticresistancepromoting or developmentdisturbing properties according to white are parabens formaldehyde triclosan polyethylene phthalates and fragrance fragrance formulas are protected as trade secrets so their ingredients are rarely disclosed white noted that the additives often include phthalates research published in november added an increased risk of preterm birth to the list of phthalates potential health hazards lip gloss mascara perfume they are popular stocking stuffers white added but there are some serious concerns being raised each day an app very similar to environmental working groups is available for mobile phones called think dirty launched in october its database includes close to 14000 products primarily best sellers according to founder and ceo lily tse a comparison of the two apps by the huffington post showed significant differences between scores on the same products edge sensitive skin shave gel for example rated 4 out of 10 on environmental working groups app and 10 out of 10 on tses higher values mean greater toxicities according to both scales tse suggested the discrepancy reflects differing philosophies on toxic chemical exposures for myself and many others with chemical sensitivity its important to stay away if a certain chemical is present regardless of how much of it is there said tse in this case the presence of peg90m triethanolamine and fragrance put the shave gel in the red tses advice for the holidays minimize fragrance use to protect yourself and others around you who may be chemically sensitive you dont need to overload to show holiday spirit she said perhaps no sight or smell represents the holiday spirit more than a christmas tree but the season staple isnt without chemical dangers from pesticides at tree farms to lead and phthalates found in fake plastic versions and on the lights traditionally strung across branches yales wargo said he will likely be on the hunt for a christmas tree this holiday weekend i cant bring myself to buy a fake tree we go to a tree farm every year he said choosing one that runs sustainably without pesticides still wargos family falls short of avoiding chemical dangers he recalled shopping for an extension cord the other day and seeing the ubiquitous warning label for lead he said he uses old christmas lights that are also likely contaminated mike schade of the nonprofit center for health environment and justice who helped create the safemarketsorg website emphasized the health hazards associated with pvc also know as vinyl used widely in fake christmas trees lights and in products wrapped and put under trees he called pvc the poison plastic from production to use to disposal it releases harmful chemicals that are building up in our bodies and are linked to chronic health problems on rise schade said listing links to cancer learning disabilities and obesity among other conditions he noted that heat from lights can encourage chemical additives to leach out phthalates and lead are among chemicals that have been commonly added to pvc to soften and stabilize the plastic while some companies have eliminated those chemicals scientists are finding that organotins and other replacement additives may be toxic too we dont want to be a grinch schade said we just recommend consumers avoid purchasing trees toys or infant products made of pvc even if they are labeled lead or phthalatefree a potential red flag are items imported from china added schade several such products have been found in recent years to be contaminated with lead or elevated phthalates but just because its made in the us doesnt mean its necessarily safe schade said our chemical safety system is broken even the patches in place to help protect consumers advocates warned are far from foolproof while laws restrict certain chemicals from products aimed at younger children for example penelope jagessar chaffer warned that parents also need to be cautious about what they bring into the home for older members of their family play jewelry gifted to a teen girl for example may find its way into the hands and mouth of a more vulnerable little sister or brother jagessar chaffer is the director of the film toxic baby which will be released next year as an innovative ipad app with additional footage an interactive map of toxic sites across the country and an encyclopedia of information on toxic chemicals one of the awards for pledging to her soontolaunch kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign will be a toxic audit available for christmas or new years people do tend to buy a lot from black friday onward said jagessar chaffer i can help them navigate what presents to get what they bring into their home she added that if people plan to purchase bigticket items during afterchristmas sales she can also help them manage toxicity levels or even decide if now is the time to buy an air filter or hepa vacuum its this rise and dispersal of information that experts and advocates said they believe is the key to solving our toxic chemical woes wargo likened it to the evolution of organic food that was caused he said by widescale recognition among consumers that pesticides are potentially dangerous as more people are educated our hope is that theyll take action to move the market said environmental working groups white as the market changes we hope the political climate changes giving more hope for revising our outdated law we cant

for democracy', body='the upcoming march for science is in many ways a march for democracy and if you like freedom and equality or at least whats left of them you should march in support of science thats because science is the foundation of democracy the ideas of science were critical to americas founders battles to beat back the authoritarianism of king george benjamin franklin was a scientist thomas jefferson was a scientist and lawyer benjamin rush was a scientist and physician george washington stressed the importance of science in the first state of the union address this is because for freedom to survive it has to be based on the idea that there is such a thing as objective reality that we can all turn to to settle arguments of fact and what creates that objective reality evidence from science without it we are left with arguments being won by the person with the biggest stick the fattest wallet the most violent mob or the most ardent religious followers given how these authoritarian alternatives played out over the centuries the idea of a democracy based on science seemed pretty good to our nations founders and it should to us too in 1776 when jefferson was writing the declaration of independence he turned to his three idolsthe scientists isaac newton francis bacon and john locke he synthesized their thinking into a simple but compelling argument that if anyone could discover the truth of something for him or herself using the tools of reason and science then all men are created equal and no king no pope and no wealthy lord had any more right to govern than the people themselves it was selfevident in turn attacks on science weaken the foundation of the notion of a shared objective reality on which democracy depends to function and thats exactly whats happening in politics today as attacks by ideologues and industry have been broadcast by a news media trained that there is no such thing as objectivity we have become paralyzed and our government is at risk of failing massive antiscience public relations campaigns whose sole purpose is to forestall or reverse evidencebased legislation their funders dont like have the side effect of undermining the public requirement that politicians stick to the facts the public relations strategy has seven distinct steps to create uncertainties and manipulate the media they are used in every industry where this happens tobacco fossil fuels pesticides sugar mining and others it goes like this fund and create fake science that uses cherrypicking phacking and other statistical tricks to create a counter narrative that can form a basis for creating public uncertainties about the real science then publish it in fake journals which is easy to do online direct slanted press materials to bloggers whose websites pay them per click and encourage them to attack the integrity conclusions and motives of the respected scientists in the field use the attacks and blog posts to drive the manufactured controversy into the mainstream press fund and create industryaligned frontgroups to whip up grassroots anger and frustration about the controversy and the limits to freedom the real scientists findings will supposedly cause then hold demonstrations and publicity events hire contrarian scientists to proselytize about the uncertainties of the legitimate science to professionals and influencers in the local communities of the member of congress you are trying to influence and to appear in committee hearings on the topic once in the press push the story by placing opinion pieces in papers and booking advocates on television shows to discuss the controversy work with sympathetic legislators to craft bills that address the problem limiting or rolling back regulations and legislation based on the evidence because of the appearance of a controversy and arguing that any action is premature at this point representatives of the innocent corporations that have been funding the attacks can safely step out from behind the curtain and testify on the bill showing how its adoption would cost american jobs and reduce freedom the method has been used so successfully for so long that science has come to be viewed by many political leaders as just another special interest or ideological view which can be regarded as partisan and dismissed we hear cries of how liberal scientists with a socialist agenda want to control your life and limit your freedom why should we fund science at all is the logical conclusion of such a train of thought and so we are now seeing drastic historic cuts proposed two things bear remembering science is never partisan its very method is designed to cull what we know away from our many biases but science is always political science creates knowledge knowledge is power and that power either confirms or challenges somebodys vested interests which is always a political act and theres the rub but the dangers of denial are immense in germany in 1920 deniers of the theory of relativity mounted ad hominem attacks against albert einstein branding general relativity as a hoax and denouncing its jewish nature this world is a strange

something similar happened in china during the cultural revolution it happened in the roman empire the ottoman empire renaissance italy 20th century russia and nazi germanyall of them societies whose

against women resulted in his being fired from his position as cochair of the weinstein company the fallout was decisive it is essential to our companys culture that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination the board reported according to buzzfeed but such swift and definitive action is not the norm the silence around a legacy of incidents like those surrounding hurricane harvey weinstein is perpetuated in most all industries the authors of the new book rights on trial how workplace discrimination perpetuates inequality examined nearly 2000 cases filed between 1988 and 2003 across the us the three authors interviewed more than 100 plaintiffs defendants lawyers and involved parties to find that the workplace often is not fair in cases of discrimination the success rate for cases of discrimination filed is dismal only two percent of plaintiffs win at trial that is after 19 percent of the cases were dismissed half or 50 percent have early settlements 18 percent of the cases are lost on summary judgment and 8 percent of the cases have a late settlement but each one of those cases is a story and in each one of of those cases voice is a metaphor for civil justice voice is important in legal disputes says laura beth nielsen a coauthor of the book that literally gives voice to those involved with audio clips of the interviews on its site in these workplace wars the stories are heartbreaking says nielsen research professor at the american bar foundation and professor of sociology and director of legal studies at northwestern university consider the case of kristen baker whose case is highlighted in the book baker was a 33yearold assistant buyer in the sales division of a small familyowned manufacturing company a salesman began bringing pornographic magazines and movies to work and also charging for admission to viewing parties of those movies in the conference room at lunch time he showed her pictures of bestiality she filed multiple complaints to human resources then the final straw was the salesmans physical act of sexual harassment so baker filed a discrimination case her employer offered her 10000 to leave the company baker eventually settled for 1 a public apology and the option to keep her job authors nielsen robert l nelson and ellen berrey write in the book it may be difficult to believe that discrimination this blatant and offensive still occurs in american workplaces every day but it does in her new book reset my fight for inclusion and lasting change ellen pao who lost her 16 million gender discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield byers in 2015 said it was

ohios congressional map', body='the american civil liberties union is suing ohio to strike down the states congressional map saying it was intentionally drawn to so egregiously benefit republicans that it violates the constitution since 2012 republicans have consistently won the same 12 of ohios 16 congressional seats while winning between 51 and 59 percent of the states popular vote the suit alleges that republicans maintain this remarkable advantage because they controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and worked in secret to draw a map to guarantee just that outcome each year the suit was filed wednesday in federal court on behalf of 16 voters in each of the states congressional districts the ohio chapter of the league of women voters and the a philip randolph institute a labor and civil rights group the lawsuit underscores a growing confidence among voting rights groups over the last few years in bringing challenges to congressional plans that republicans have benefited from since 2012 the supreme court has never said whether an electoral map can be so partisan that it violates the constitution but it is expected to rule in two cases that make that argument in june a ruling setting constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering could profoundly affect american politics by requiring lawmakers to draw districts that are more competitive two more congressional elections are due to take place under ohios current map before the next round of redistricting in 2021 even though litigation can move very slowly the aclu hopes to have a new map in place for the 2020 congressional elections alora thomas an attorney with the aclu said her organization felt encouraged to bring the suit after multiple rulings in lower courts blocking electoral maps in wisconsin and north carolina on partisan grounds those rulings are currently paused while the supreme court considers appeals in january the pennsylvania supreme court struck down the states congressional maps as too partisan for the state constitution a challenge to michigans congressional map on partisan grounds is also before a federal court because courts are really now open to taking a look at this issue and it looks like theyre going the right way and finding partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional the question becomes well where else is there a problem and is it something that needs to be addressed now thomas told huffpost ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country an analysis by the brennan center for justice found that ohios congressional map has some of the most severe partisan bias in the country and accounts for between two and three additional gop seats in the current congress thomas said the aclu didnt want to wait until ohio got a new congressional map in 2022 because ohio residents have already spent nearly a decade voting under a map the group believes is unconstitutional a fairer map in place before the next round of redistricting thomas said could ensure that the map for the subsequent decade is also fairer ohio voters also recently approved a ballot initiative to change the way redistricting is done in the state a move that advocates hope will rein in excessive partisan gerrymandering the suit argues that the ohio map violates the first and 14th amendments as well as article i of the constitution the map violates the first amendment the suit says because it amounts to an effort to skew electoral outcomes to freeze their advantage and insulate their majority from changes in voter preferences it violates the 14th amendment the aclu says because lawmakers drew the map intentionally to disfavor democratic voters in the state without a legitimate reason to do so the aclu also argues that in drawing such a severely gerrymandered map ohio lawmakers exceeded the power the constitution gives them to regulate elections the case will hinge significantly on what the supreme court decides by the end of june during oral argument in two partisan gerrymandering cases this year the court seemed willing to allow some amount of politics in redistricting but appeared closely divided on whether it was possible to determine if partisan gerrymandering could go so far that it violates the constitution justice anthony kennedy who wrote in a 2004 case that such a standard might exist is seen as the critical swing vote in the case and advocates have offered a number of standards with the hope that he might find one he likes ohio gov john kasich r who signed the states congressional map into law in 2011 is named as a defendant in the suit but kasich has recently been an outspoken opponent of partisan gerrymandering and was one of a number of republican elected officials who urged the supreme court in october to step in and do something about gerrymandering in a brief filed with the supreme court kasich and other republican officials took a position similar to what the aclu is arguing in the ohio case saying that partisan gerrymanders are repugnant to the constitution and violate the first and 14th amendments update 250 pm ohio secretary of state jon husted r one of the state officials named as a defendant in the suit criticized the challenge if the way the congressional lines were drawn was such an issue for the aclu a philip randolph institute and league of women voters why did they wait six years to file a lawsuit challenging the maps husted said wednesday in a statement these groups should respect the will of ohios voters who overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment earlier this month that established a new bipartisan process for drawing congressional districts starting in 2021'}.

responsible for the crackdown and on capitol hill democrats and republicans have rallied behind measures to increase pressure on myanmars leaders president donald trump has been largely silent on the rohingya so far but the unlikely collaboration on one of the worlds largest human rights crises could result in one of the few major international accomplishments of his time in office thus far if trump decides to personally join the effort that is and if senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky stops blocking votes on the issue we really think this could be a success story for the administration said francisco bencosme an advocacy official at the nonprofit group amnesty international theres been highlevel engagement but at the same time the buck stops with the president we havent seen president trump speak out for the rohingya until theres presidential leadership we still think theres room for more myanmars military and allied buddhist militias killed and raped thousands of rohingya last year after rohingya militants attacked security outposts in august some 700000 members of the historically demonized ethnic and religious minority group fled from myanmars western rakhine state to neighboring bangladesh because of the violence trump aides have been working to help the rohingya refugees leave the cramped camps rebuild their burneddown villages and gain the full citizenship rights they have been denied for decades in october the administration cut off us assistance for myanmar military officials involved in operations in rakhine and the following month it declared the assault ethnic cleansing trump placed sanctions on a prominent myanmar general involved in the offensive in december and last month reuters revealed that a state department team has been gathering rohingya allegations of abuse that could be used for further sanctions and international prosecution of myanmar officials theres a high level of interest in the administration over this sam brownback the us ambassador for international religious freedom told the wall street journal after visiting the camps in april on monday nikki haley the us ambassador to the united nations chastised myanmar ally china for watering down a un security council statement on the issue at a refugee camp the next day us agency for international development chief mark green said the state department will provide new policy recommendations to the president later this summer he also announced 44 million more in us humanitarian aid to feed and house the rohingya bringing the total to nearly 300 million the steps have won the trump team uncommon praise from congress where parallel efforts are in the works sen jeff merkley dore a leader on the issue who led lawmakers on a trip to the region last year said he was encouraged by both the state departments use of the ethnic cleansing label and the tough language from haley this is a massive case of horrific ethnic cleansing and some would say a genocide merkley told huffpost it was a horrific assault on these defenseless villages and america should be in the forefront of the worlds action merkley has sponsored a senate resolution urging the safe dignified voluntary and sustainable return of the rohingya to myanmar cosponsored by six gop senators its one of two bills on the situation that passed out of the senate foreign relations committee this spring the other sponsored by sen john mccain rariz and supported by 19 other senators makes similar demands and outlines procedures for pressuring myanmar by placing sanctions on military officials and reducing us purchases of the jade and rubies that are among its top exports both proposals have the support of the no 2 democrat in the chamber sen dick durbin ill who went on the trip with merkley and are linked to parallel legislation in the house support from trump for those bills could help them overcome opposition from mcconnell the senate majority leader is a longtime supporter of aung san suu kyi the activist and nobel peace prize winner who was held under house arrest by myanmars military until 2010 mcconnell pushed hard for her release and for the junta to begin loosening its grip on power now suu kyi is the most powerful civilian in the countrys government but shes facing major international criticism for her failure to acknowledge the rohingyas suffering or publicly challenge myanmars generals mcconnell has said the us should acknowledge the crisis but be wary of upending the power balance in the country publicly condemning aung san suu kyi the best hope for democratic reform in burma is not constructive mcconnell said in september referring to myanmar by its former name as us officials often do that argument has some powerful supporters within the state department which led an obamaera policy of limited engagement that involved easing us sanctions on the country as its military rulers made concessions like releasing suu kyi the agencys top asia official acting assistant secretary susan thornton is reluctant to publicly condemn myanmar or china for fear of reducing us influence over them or weakening suu kyis position trump aides and congressional staffers say those working for the rohingya see that thinking as outdated given suu kyis track record in recent years im a big supporter of suu kyi all the rohingya supported her said imam abdul malik mujahid an american muslim leader involved in lobbying around the issue but she has enough authority and she doesnt do anything with it we hope that mcconnell will have a second look a strong statement from the white house might acknowledge that reality and trigger faster stronger american action trump has not publicly spoken about the crisis despite private commitments during his first official trip to asia last year merkley believes the lack of a presidential statement creates a global perception of indifference if the president doesnt know about it or worse yet knows about it and doesnt care about it either one is an enormous failing he said spokespeople for mcconnell and the white house did not respond to requests for comment the situation may soon get worse because of monsoon season which often brings cyclones and floods humanitarian groups are worried about its impact on the refugee camps in bangladesh and the possibility that a fresh catastrophe could exacerbate budding bengali resentment toward the refugees meanwhile myanmars government is dampening hopes of a peaceful return by aggressively transforming the rohingyas homeland and limiting supplies of food and medicine to those rohingya who still live in the country it has prevented united nations officials rights groups and the media from freely exploring the area though some have snuck in to document ongoing government crackdowns and rohingya have been sharing accounts of arson and worsening poverty through social media top congressional staff working on the issue discovered the lengths myanmars leaders would go to downplay abuses during a visit this spring an aide told huffpost while they flew over rakhine state the windows on the government plane carrying them were blacked out so they could not see burnedout rohingya villages that only strengthened the feeling that something needs to change fast the aide said officials and activists hope secretary of state mike pompeo and others close to trump can get the issue on the presidents radar soon whether by using upcoming state department reports including one on whether the us believes myanmars actions constitute crimes against humanity or just appealing to his political instincts taking action on myanmar could allow trump to depict himself as fixing one of former president barack obamas mistakes theres increasing public skepticism of obamas 2012 decision to ease sanctions on myanmar and stay relatively quiet about the persecution of the rohingya in hopes of facilitating a transition to democracy the situation offers trump a rare chance to win international acclaim by charting a different course on foreign policy from obama its not yet clear whether the president sees the opportunity'}.

pollution authority in supreme court cases', body='by lawrence hurley and valerie volcovici washington nov 24 reuters the us governments authority to regulate air pollution nationwide often against the wishes of republicanleaning states could face new curbs when the us supreme court takes on two highstakes cases in coming months the cases focus on the broadranging power wielded by the us environmental protection agency epa under the landmark clean air act first enacted in 1970 the law was envisioned as a cooperative effort between the federal government and states in which the epa sets standards but states have to set plans to comply that flexibility has allowed states which favor looser regulations like texas and kansas to resist with the support of industry groups like the us chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers when the agency wants to impose more stringent standards in both cases before the conservativeleaning supreme court mainly republicanled states and industry groups have challenged different epa regulations in the hope of weakening the agencys authority the epa has support from democraticleaning states like massachusetts and new york and from environmental groups it would be both a big deal and somewhat unsurprising if epa loses both clean air act cases said richard frank an environmental law professor at the university of california at davis school of law such rulings would reflect a dilution of the deference that courts generally show government agencies in interpreting statutes he added the cases do not challenge whether the epa can regulate pollutants such as greenhouse gases but instead how it uses the clean air act to regulate a wide range of them the epas authority to interpret the statute broadly is vital to its mission in the face of resistance from republicans and a handful of democrats in congress and some state governments in the climate change context in particular the clean air act is the epas main tool for tackling greenhouse gas emissions after the us senate rejected a capandtrade bill in 2010 the supreme court rulings are unlikely to have a direct impact on president barack obamas sweeping climate action plan which was unveiled in june legal experts say in part because the epa will be using its authority under parts of the law not at issue in the cases but decisions against the epa could pose obstacles to the way it rolls out its rules in the first case to be argued on dec 10 the nine justices will consider the legality of a rule that regulates air pollution that crosses state lines the second case expected to be scheduled for oral argument in february concerns a challenge to the obama administrations first wave of regulations targeting heattrapping greenhouse gases the court is due to issue rulings in both cases by the end of june interstate pollution the epas crossstate air pollution rule meant to take effect in january 2012 would have set limits on nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from coalfired power plants in 28 states that emit pollutants in the eastern part of the country that directly affect air quality in other states generally referred to as upwind states an alliance of industry groups and 15 states in addition to companies like southern co peabody energy corp and american electric power inc challenged the rule and it was never implemented the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit determined in august 2012 that the rule was invalid on multiple grounds under the worstcase scenario for the government the supreme court could weaken the epas power to bring recalcitrant states into line legal experts said in the obama administrations petition asking for supreme court review of the crossstate rule solicitor general donald verrilli said that if the dc circuit decision stood it would gravely undermine enforcement of the clean air act delaying the ability of downwind states to comply with air standards and making it nearly impossible for those states to meet deadlines a ruling against the epa could also encourage states to resist other epa proposals if the supreme court pushes back against the epa and says the epa has to give the states the first chance to address the problem that gives the states more leverage said jonathan martel a partner at law firm arnold porter llp who represents business interests in air pollution cases climate change rules in the climate change case the supreme court agreed last month to consider a single question of the many raised by nine different coalitions of industry groups such as the american petroleum institute and 16 states including texas and virginia they appealed a june 2012 ruling by the appeals court in washington upholding the first suite of epa rules aimed at tackling climate change the justices will weigh only whether the agency has authority to regulate greenhouse gases under a permitting program for stationary sources of pollution a loss for the epa could remove a whole category of pollutants not just greenhouse gases from the socalled prevention of serious deterioration or psd program which requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain a permit before any new construction is done if it emits any air pollutant under the program the operators have to show that they are using the best available technology available to reduce emissions of the covered pollutants it may not be all bad news for the epa the court passed up a chance to review the agencys determination that greenhouse gases the driving force behind climate change are a pollutant that needs to be regulated under the clean air act wins for the epa in both cases would not however lead to any major shift in the law in its favor experts say everything continues to be hard work for the epa said sean donahue an attorney who represents the environmental defense fund theres tremendous resistance at every turn

talk to this gay one', body='last winter erik sent a message to 20 of his least favorite porn stars youtube celebrities and instagays so are you like a real person or just another shallow empty fuckboy who works in an industry that props up unrealistic gay male beautysex standards and wouldnt be caught dead with anyone below pornboy looks erik isnt his real name hes 28 years old he works for the government he lives in the midwest and thats as specific as im going to get speaking objectively he says when i ask him to describe himself im pearshaped ive got a tummy mantitties and a big squishy butt i also have a nice haircut a clean face and a nice smile i met erik a few months ago right around the time his flurry of pornstar trolling reached its zenith he read my article about gay loneliness and messaged me to say that it resonated i feel like a failure as a gay guy he wrote because im 28 and i havent had much sexual experience even though ive been out since i was 18 the more i got to know erik the more familiar his story sounded for years ive lurked on message boards for selfdescribed incels involuntary celibates men who think theyve been unjustly denied sex what i heard from erik were the same resentments the same hurts the same mixture of jealousy and desire i had scrolled through on reddit with of course one crucial difference the incels weve heard of elliot rodger who killed six people in isla vista in 2014 and alek minassian who mowed down 10 people in toronto last month were both mass killers erik even at the darkest points of his incelar period as he calls it says he never contemplated anything violent but his experience how he gathered contempt for the people he wanted to sleep with and eventually got over it says a lot about whats really behind the incel phenomenon and why it seems to be getting worse eriks radicalization began five years ago when his family fell behind on bills and he had to take a second job to help them catch up i didnt have the time or the money to go out and meet people because i was always working he says he was 23 years old living with his parents doing day shifts at a bigbox retail store and nights at a call center dialing for political donations i felt isolated and alone and crippled the resentment started with myself i would think what did you do to deserve this then the selfloathing became loathing of everyone around me why am i propping up this family he describes a widening circle of resentment he had no time for dates and no car for hookups his first and only sexual experience had been a onenight stand some dude he met on facebook while studying abroad his attempts at flirting in bars ended badly one guy whom erik describes as divapretty once told him i wouldnt even rape you he had started to think of the men he was attracted to slim prettyfaced guys who looked like they had a lot of money who lived that west hollywood lifestyle who could eat whatever they wanted and never gain a single pound as the cause of his failures they were shallow superficial hoarding status and sex and power and denying it to him the ones i hated the most he says were the gorgeous white rich gay men on instagram saying youve just got to love your body or its not about whats on the outside i would be like fuck you you dont know what its like to be rejected you havent weighed more than 100 pounds in the last 30 years i tell erik that he doesnt strike me as the kind of guy who would actually enjoy the west hollywood lifestyle all that much vip rooms bottle service duckface selfies werent you just telling me that your ideal gay bar was somewhere you could wear a tux and sing show tunes i ask it was more about attaining status than finding love or even sex he says even though i didnt actually want the lifestyle they were broadcasting i wanted to feel worthy of having it as affirmed by others i wanted to be the alpha male whats at the heart of eriks experience and the incel phenomenon more generally says jennifer bosson a masculinity researcher at the university of south florida is the concept of precarious masculinity manhood is conceptualized as something that has to be earned she said and once you earn it you have to defend it it can be lost look at almost any culture she adds and youll find that men as a group have higher status than women but within men there are huge disparities cars clothes jawlines some guys have them and some dont for the havenots it feels like theyre not reaping the benefits of being in the dominant group like theyre being denied whats owed to them when women lack power were just like oh im a woman bosson says when men lack power theyre like hey this isnt fair in other words the incel phenomenon has nothing to do with sex duh and everything to do with entitlement my personal theory is that it was the online forums the constantly updated cheering section of likeminded misanthropes that turned people like minassian into monsters though he doesnt know of any dedicated message boards for gay incels erik still managed to find places where he could voice his resentments and get them reflected back to him his forum of choice he says was the scariest place on the internet the youtube comments section he found articles and videos that critiqued gay male beauty standards then scrolled down until he found snark and resentments that echoed his own its like hey this person is dejected and unfucked as well we have something in common we can share our loathing of people we perceive to be the problem he shows me screenshots of what this looked like your issues with body image are not the same as those of objectively ugly people like myself is how one of the comments on a youtube video begins another a twitter thread starts with a message to a model tweeting about his mental illness how nice of a conventionally hotpretty boy to tell us regular folk with our plain looks mediocre sex lives nonadonis figures such noble sentiments seeing these echoes of his own experience he says felt like relief like he wasnt alone anymore the more he built fellowship with the guys from the comment threads the more he started to see his life in usversusthem terms he started celebrating the misfortunes of his online enemies someone posts about their breakup on social media and id be like oh look the pretty person feels sad they have no chance of getting anyone else boo hoo some of the people he met online actually seemed happy cheering on the misfortune of the pretty people he says teach that narcissistic little fucker that life doesnt revolve around him i was being just as judgmental and shallow as i thought the enemy was he reflects the irony never occurred to me curtis puryear a colleague of bossons who specializes in online radicalization tells me erik followed a fairly typical pattern whether online or offline being around likeminded people tends to result in having stronger views whether youre a vegetarian or someone who thinks crash shouldnt have won an oscar being around a bunch of people with the same opinion usually makes you feel it more intensely the internet puryear says allows you to find people and activate identities you never could if you had to rely on facetoface interactions if you live in a small town like erik does its pretty hard to find enough fellow incels to form a community on the internet though nearly any identity can become the basis for sharing empathy information and grievances feeling like youre a member of a disadvantaged group brings some psychological benefits puryear continues its a way to write off failures you feel like the deck is stacked against you if youre an incel and you feel attacked then that identity will become more important for you over time one of the stories about elliot rodger i cant get out of my head dates back to the summer before his shooting rampage rodger saw a group of women playing kickball in a park according to ralph w larkins learning to be a rampage shooter rodger immediately left bought a super soaker filled it with orange juice and came back he ran onto the field and hosed down the players he had no goal other than ruining their fun they deserved to die horrible painful deaths he wrote later about the women just for the crime of enjoying a better life than me i ask erik whether he ever lashed out like this even in small ways he says he didnt he tells me that when his coworkers used to complain about gaining weight he would ask them if they wanted to trade bodies with him it was my way of saying shut up i dont want to hear any complaining from conventionally attractive people he says pretty dickish he admits but a far cry from even the warning signs of the violence that people like rodger have carried out i ask bosson about this whether something about gayness keeps gay men from lashing out the way straight men do she points out first that only a small percentage of men are gay maybe theres fewer gay mass shooters because theres fewer of us overall and its not like gayness grants immunity from masculinity norms we see the same valorizing of straightacting and stigmatization of femininity in gay men that we see in straight men bosson says confirming what you already know if youve spent more than five minutes on grindr and masculinity is inextricably linked to violence bossons lab runs studies where they threaten mens status by making them braid a mannequins hair or telling them they got a typical female score on a knowledge test afterward the men hit a punching bag harder and blasted their fellow research subjects well a simulation of them with higher levels of punitive white noise than men whose masculinity hadnt been challenged if you threaten mens sense of their gender status and make them feel for a moment that theyre not a real man they lash out she says for men who feel like their sense of masculinity is under constant threat like being unemployed or ahem not getting laid it may take smaller and smaller threats to provoke their anger it took a response from his targets for eriks fiveyear incelar period to become something else while most of the porn stars and instagays blocked him after he sent them the fuckboy message some replied i am poor as fuck one of them wrote about to lose my cheap apartment i have til the end of the month to move out looks are not everything erik shows me screenshots sorry he replied its just it must be nice to be gay and hot and have some of the best sex on the planet i have not had sex since october of last year it was not hot or fun the porn star wrote and to eriks apology if you continue acting that way you will have nothing like i have nothing he got other responses too after he copypasted his message to a porn producer and got blocked erik contacted him on snapchat to apologize the producer explained that lots of porn was fake gasp and that the actors making it were people too another enemy who got eriks message posted it on twitter and said that his life might look perfect on the outside but he was struggling with drug addiction and had been abandoned by his family eric felt traumatized overwhelmed with guilt over what he had done thats when the fog started to lift it didnt make me feel better automatically but i started to think that if these guys were conventionally attractive and have what im supposed to have and theyre still miserable then maybe i dont need to worry so the happy ending is that everyone is miserable i ask no he says but its like i spent years collecting stamps building up this whining and resentment when i could have just accepted that i wasnt in grad school and working these mediocre jobs hes dating someone now a retail clerk he met on okcupid right after he decided to trade twitter dms for an okcupid profile sneak that into your article somehow he says from incel to excel theyve been together two months now but hes having trouble shedding his old habits id like to think ive improved and am content now that i found someone who not only i like but who actually thinks im beautiful he says but the envy and resentment are still there envy he says because other people still look so attractive resentment because he thinks he never will although hes different than rodgers and minassian eriks anger too came from a mismatch between expectations and reality if this was pre1980s maybe id feel more different from a straight incel he says but with the mainstreaming of gay people the expectations have become more mainstream too youre expected to be financially stable to look a certain way to have the right partner and the right hookups when you cant live up to that image then the inferiority complex comes erik is the first gay incel ive ever met that doesnt mean hell be the last'}.

woman karen simmons a 50yearold former sales representative based in alabama spent nearly two years with monster she amassed a strong track record even as she fended off one of her atlantabased managers ted cook who hit on her made comments about her breasts tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an evening nightcap in his hotel room on work trips she told huffpost robert duck simmons direct boss who works out of monsters office in florida also witnessed cooks behavior but told her to brush it off she said he said ted was harmless a dirty old man simmons recalled through a company spokesman duck said simmons never complained when reached by phone by huffpost he hung up he did not respond to followup texts cook also did not respond to a call text or linkedin message simmons took her complaints no further what was i gonna say i loved my job i needed my job she said simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry a notoriously unfriendly business for women i knew saying things gets you retaliation what simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women last april simmons was fired for reasons she still doesnt quite understand monster says it was for poor performance according to a spokesman for the company simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest in the fall she filed sex and age discrimination charges against monster at the us equal employment opportunity commission monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues as first reported in a huffpost investigation in january one monster executive head of music marketing brent hamilton is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip he is still employed by the company another executive john kenneally a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company resigned after huffpost published details of the accusations in january he ran the business unit that simmons worked in in public statements at the time the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated monster energy has zerotolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind the company said in january monster takes all reported complaints very seriously any suggestions to the contrary are false just as huffpost was set to publish this story monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures the investigators will report straight to the companys board of directors we are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of our culture and practices monster chairman and ceo rodney sacks and vice chair and president hilton schlosberg said in a statement but they added that in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits we believe it is prudent the company declined to provide more details on the third party if there are areas where there are deficients we will correct them sacks and schlosberg said in a statement to huffpost earlier in march monster said it wasnt aware of simmons complaints until recently ms simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company the statement said monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with simmons and her lawyer in midfebruary the statement said this was about three weeks after huffpost published its investigation the statement points out monster also said that cook is no longer with the company simmons former boss duck who she said witnessed cooks behavior is still working at monster through a spokesman monster also told huffpost that simmons account was not accurate simmons last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement the spokesman said it was not positive in response to other questions and requests for information the spokesman wrote many of the other allegations or questions are untrue are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this after reading huffposts reports and looking into the cases filed against monster simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company page zeringue had gone to the human resources department to complain about cook well before simmons started working under him in a lawsuit against monster zeringue alleges that her complaint to hr helped trigger her firing ostensibly for bad performance meanwhile cook was sent to sexual harassment training according to internal documents viewed by huffpost this was around the same time simmons was hired monster energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity scantily clad monster girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors one beverage is actually called assault a few years ago the company gave out monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick that toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously monsters employee guidelines reviewed by huffpost require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it but in simmons case it appears that her direct boss duck never informed hr about cooks conduct even if hr learns about misbehavior what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously at monster terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations months after employees read their reviews according to documents reviewed by huffpost even in an industry known for being heavily male monster stands out particularly in the sales division where simmons worked overall only 13 percent of the companys 505person us sales team are women if you include administrative assistants the percentage rises to 18 percent female according to an internal employee directory from january obtained by huffpost none of the companys 11 vicepresidents in sales are women monster said some of the numbers huffpost obtained were incorrect but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data in an earlier statement to huffpost the company said many women hold top leadership positions within monster and pointed to its chief commercialization officer emelie tirre still sales is so maledominated at monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in las vegas even with human resource representatives in attendance a vicepresident told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room according to three separate accounts from current and former employees the joke goes like this there is an old bull and a young bull on a hill overlooking a field of cows young bull says to the old bull lets run down there and fuck a cow old bull says nah lets walk down there and fuck them all it was meant to inspire simmons recalls being appalled but she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues after all she had spent most of her career in beverage sales a notoriously sexist culture she knew how to handle herself over the past three years at least four other women in the east division where simmons worked were fired or pushed out they include simmons two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination and one who declined to speak on the record with huffpost but has since quit as of january 2018 there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with cook and duck given the companys cultural penchant for partying drinking alcohol at these meetups was a given she didnt drink and repeatedly rebuffed cooks efforts to get her drunk she said she declined his invitations for a nightcap in his hotel room the more ted drank the more handsy he got simmons told huffpost on one occasion when he asked for a hug simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a halfhug he wasnt satisfied and pulled her in for a doover she said he said i felt that simmons said meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest arguably simmons should never have had to deal with cook in the first place two years earlier zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company huffpost obtained zeringues original complaint to hr in it she said cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks and was known as touchy ted around the office she detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker he also pulled the huggingclose move on her she said the hr department reached out to cooks boss kenneally the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after huffposts investigation published kenneally defended cook telling the hr representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were no noted recurrences according to a review of an internal hr report obtained by huffpost kenneally also made a point of criticizing zeringue her performance is not where it needs to be he is quoted as saying when cook was confronted by hr he confessed and said he learned his lesson according to internal notes he also conceded that touchy ted was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company another being uncle ted he was assigned to sexual harassment training called stop sexual harassment training for supervisors and given a warning its unclear if hr ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track zeringue was fired a month later in her complaint against monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up that suit is now headed to private arbitration outside the public court system it was around this time at a dinner in new orleans that simmons attended with cook duck and several other male monster employees that she said she heard them joking about having to go to hr classes if they misbehaved it was just like a big joke simmons said simmons last few months at monster played out like a corporate gaslighting in february 2017 less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from duck he asked to meet up with her in florida where they had both traveled for business what happened next came as a total shock duck showed her a disciplinary writeup for stuff i didnt do simmons said the writeup which huffpost has reviewed claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work yet she was in florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup i was out of town every week she said the writeup also claims that duck spoke with simmons in january about these issues simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the companys internal website monster provided huffpost with a copy of the document dated dec 31 the review judges simmons performance as meets standards giving her a 214 rating out of 4 and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism at this point the only thing i can ask karen to improve on is slowing down duck wrote she also needs a little more work on time management he called her a great problem solver who sometimes needs help prioritizing i have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meetingto always make sure she can do it in the category of job knowledge and skill duck gave simmons a rating of 3 or exceeds expectations so the negative writeup baffled

to go home and forget about it simmons said for about a monthandahalf after that duck still simmons direct supervisor did not talk to simmons she said he wouldnt respond to texts or calls one thing he apparently did do update simmons dec 31 performance review topping the document off with an extremely harsh summary paragraph slamming her for poor performance the added paragraph is dated march 3 2017 the tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document at this point karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to fix this soon or she will struggle duck wrote karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her coke partners duck used gendercoded words like abrasive and demanding to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at cocacola bottlers simmons worked with the final comment was meant to assess simmons work from the end of december through march a monster spokesman told huffpost the final comments reflect not only her managers assessment of her work through 123117 he said but the final comment on 030317 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 123117 and before the final comment simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by huffpost monster which provided huffpost with the review claimed that simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph however monster could not provide evidence that she did according to monsters records simmons signed her review on march 1 two days before duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph finally in late april duck broke the silence he called simmons and said he needed to meet in person but when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of daphne alabama he was there with cook and they had an hr representative on the phone to talk to her she was fired it was like somebody just punched me in the stomach simmons said she cried and begged she said telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer

the woman who had complained about cook years earlier also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired she declined too interestingly cook retired less than a month later its unclear why his colleagues threw him a going away party and just a few months later during christmas time in 2017 cook returned to monsters atlanta office dressed up as santa claus young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures one woman posted a shot on facebook captioned uncleted simmons meanwhile took her dismissal hard she was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her

morning or ten or 11 at night because she lost her job simmons husband a 68yearold who supervises utility crews in tampa has had to put off his retirement he had relocated to tampa temporarily to make

introduced to assist farmers affected by low commodity prices or belowaverage crop production the bnd also helped fund 300 new businesses all this is in a state with half the population of phoenix or philadelphia a california coalition is forming to establish a stateowned bank for california coalition organizers say a california state bank will cut the states longterm financing costs in half compared to what avaricious wall street is charging the nations largest state equivalent to the worlds sixth largest economy can free itself from massive debt accumulation bidrigging deceptive

billion including those in a pooled money investment account managed by the state treasurer that contains 54 billion earning less than 1 percent interest money in these funds is earmarked for specific expenditure purposes but they can be invested in a new state bank to escape from a wall street that is in browns words sucking massive sums in interest fees and interest rate swap payments out of california and into offshore tax havens a state bank can use its impressive credit power to develop infrastructure in california huge state pension funds and other state funds can provide the deposits each one billion dollar capital investment can lend 10 billion for projects less expensively and under open stable banking control by california presently california and other states routinely deposit

the cities of philadelphia and santa fe look for county commissioners and state treasurers to come on board when they see the enormous safeguards and savings that can be secured through public banks in contrast to the convoluted casino run by unaccountable wall street gamblers and speculators a longtime backer of public banking retired entrepreneur richard mazess hopes that national civic groups like public citizen common cause people for the american way and consumer watchdog can get behind the proposal public not private infrastructure is essential for an equitable economy he says california already has a public infrastructure bank called the ibank mr mazess and others believe that expanding the existing ibank into a depository institution would be more likely to pass through the california legislature the deposits would come from public institutions and ngos not from private persons these pension funds and other public deposits would become reserves and serve as the basis for safely leveraged loans to public projects at a conservative tenfold multiplier no derivatives or other shenanigans allowed before that proposal can be enacted however there needs to be much more

body='can uber really change its toxic bro culture if broinchief travis kalanick sticks around the answer now is clearly no since huffpost first published this article on wednesday new revelations have emerged about the uber chief executive that offer even more evidence that kalanick is not a leader capable of managing a company where employees and customers are free from harassment and discrimination late on thursday recode published an email kalanick sent to uber employees in 2013 advising them on how to behave at an upcoming company party an excerpt speaks for itself do not have sex with another employee unless a you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic yes i will have sex with you and b the two or more of you do not work in the same chain of command yes that means that travis will be celibate on this trip ceolife fml fml indeed is it any wonder uber has a big problem with discrimination harassment and bullying when the ceo so clearly feels that the workplace is a kind of profitable frat party as uber scrambles to fix the broken workplace rife with inexperienced managers weak human resource processes sexual harassment and bullying its becoming pretty clear that kalanick shouldnt be around at the end of the process on tuesday uber fired a stunning 20 employees some senior executives for a variety of offenses including sexual harassment bullying bias and retaliation unearthed by an outside law firm an additional executive was fired recode reported because he had illegally obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an uber driver in india and showed them kalanick who took no action the executive eric alexander the president of business in the asia pacific believed the customers allegation was a hoax an indian court sentenced the driver to life in prison for his crime more firings are likely next week uber is expected to release a report on harassment and discrimination at a companywide meeting the result of a separate investigation led by former attorney general eric holder now a partner at a big dc law firm the company is desperately seeking to change its reputation in the gutter since at least february when former engineer susan fowler published a blog post detailing horrifying sexual harassment not only did fowlers boss sexually proposition her on her first day her complaint to human resources was blown off because her manager was considered too valuable an employee fowler said she heard similar stories of sexual harassment from female colleagues since then uber has taken steps to improve its human resources department and its image and a stream of top executives have fled culture changes have been well underway at the company for months now an uber spokeswoman told huffpost moving forward were more committed than ever to turning the page we want to change just this week uber hired harvard business school professor frances frei a management consultant and expert in company culture best known for her efforts to change how harvards bschool treats women uber also hired a brand consultant from apple also a woman to help improve its image thing is you dont need fancy consultants to tell you this simple truth about company culture it starts at the top the boss sets the example the tone and the norms for the entire company this applies to government as well just ask any white house staffer trying to work under president donald trump uber is just now fixing a computer algorithm to determine how much to pay new hires the old system reinforced gender pay gaps allowing women to be paid less than men kalanicks vibe is well known at this point he works obsessively hard and expects everyone at uber to do the same the result is a company worth billions and a brutal harddriving culture with incredibly high turnover apple ceo and founder steve jobs also had a reputation for driving workers hard and saying things bluntly thats not unusual for a startup founder at uber problems have come when kalanick has opened his mouth and said incredibly arrogant and misogynistic things do i trigger something in certain people thats related to something that i didnt do or am i an asshole id love to know kalanick told fortune magazines adam lashinsky i dont think im an asshole im pretty sure im not kalanick has been keeping a low profile since the recent sudden death of his mother they were reportedly very close kalanick has amassed quite a track record for inappropriate comments in an interview with gq in 2014 he bragged about how his newfound fame as a tech ceo was attracting women yeah we call that boober he said a recent story in tech publication the information described kalanicks visit to a south korean karaoke and escort bar with executives mostly men and at least one woman who reported being extremely uncomfortable his former girlfriend told huffpost recently that when she was with him theyd frequently attend parties where most of the women were models flown in to serve as essentially decor after a video of kalanick fighting with an uber driver went viral earlier this year he finally admitted his behavior was a problem its clear this video is a reflection of me and the criticism weve received is a stark reminder that i must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up kalanick wrote in a blog post titled a profound apology who decided it was profound this is the first time ive been willing to admit that i need leadership help and i intend to get it he wrote hes begun meditating according to uber board member and huffpost founder arianna huffington kalanick it is worth emphasizing is not a 20something prodigy running a tech company he is a relatively experienced executive who has been running uber since 2010 he is 40 years old this was an adult male admitting hed behaved like a child he hasnt yet proven whether he has the chops to actually grapple with his behavior companies that have managed big culture shifts usually do it with new leaders microsoft for example seems to have really changed its way since hiring satya nadella to replace steve ballmer known for fueling a toxic competitive culture kalanick has admitted he needs leadership help and this weeks hires are part of the change it seems but its not at all clear that this is enough indeed the companys hr chief liane hornsey who is close to kalanick seemed to downplay the idea that sexual harassment is even a problem at uber just last month in an interview with usa today she said pay and pride are more at issue fowlers blog shocked me hornsey said but what did surprise me was when i did the listening sessions this didnt come up as an issue it wasnt one of our big themes other things came up that are in that area that our values are masculine and a little aggressive but the harassment issue i just didnt find that at all but it seems hornsey was downplaying the situation of the 215 claims investigated by perkins coie the law firm whose report led to this weeks firings 47 involved sexual harassment ubers only female board member told cnbc on wednesday leaders arent solely responsible for the way a company operates leaders set an example joseph badaracco a professor at harvard business school told huffpost recently still he said companies need to have systems in place that reinforce employee behavior workers need to have strong managers understand the rules of the workplace and know that misbehavior will not be tolerated a fastgrowing startup inevitably has a lot of problems as it expands a majority of ubers managers are in a supervisory role for the first time creating all kinds of complications uber also hired very quickly a notoriously way to build a company culture and basically had been using its human resources department as a recruiting arm not a place to help employees with issues but for all the layers of ingredients that brought uber to where it is it would seem that problems came baked in with

aging and death', body='at age 74 i have already experienced many of the indignities of aging and before very long will also confront the inevitability of death although neither prospect is particularly pleasant i strongly believe in the normality and necessity of both claims that science will soon prevent aging and dramatically prolong life strike me as irresponsible hype and false hope i am all for efforts to expand our healthspan but see little value in prolonging our lifespan and little possibility that we will soon discover a fountain of youth my grandson home from college for christmas break disagrees with what he regards as my sentimental and regressive attachment to the status quo tyler is participating in stem cell and genetics research and believes that it is feasible and desirable to double the human lifespan and make aging just another curable disease tyler has no qualms about this research and regards my doubts as technically naive and ethically unnecessary here is a very brief point by point summary of our ongoing debate me evolution requires aging and death to make room for each new generation and also favors a fairly rapid succession of generations both are necessary to provide raw material for the variability and beneficial mutations essential to natural selection tyler evolution has little interest in aging and death natural selection focuses its selective pressure on producing optimal reproductive fitness in the mating members of any species once the period of reproduction and weaning have passed natural selection applies much less pressure on how the rest of the lifespan plays out there is thus no inherent evolutionary reason to prohibit research that would prevent aging and prolong life and there are excellent reasons to pursue it although evolution does a remarkable job when given enough time it works far too slowly and imperfectly to help us solve our current problems whenever in the past it has served our interests humans have always felt free to speed up natural selection we would still be hunters and gatherers were it not for the artificial selection of domesticated plants and animals that constituted the agricultural and pastoral revolutions if we have the genetic tools to promote human health longevity and happiness why not use them me but the world is already terribly overpopulated and is rapidly becoming even more overpopulated extending the lifespan will mean more crowding more mouths to feed more environmental degradation and more resource depletion malthusian dynamics ensure that providing a longer life for some must be purchased at the high cost of a more brutal life for the many a life threatened by even more wars migrations famines and epidemics tyler overpopulation is best solved by reducing birthrates this has already been done with great success almost everywhere in the world except africa and the middle east it will be a better more mature and healthier world if people live longer and have fewer diseases and fewer children a longer lifespan will make people wiser more future oriented and less willing to take foolish risks in the present this could lead to more rational decisions on how best to preserve our planet as a decent place to live me only the rich will be able to afford new products that prevent aging and promote longevity the resulting caste system based on lifespan will be even more unfair than our current divisions based on wealth and power tyler the distribution of benefits that will accrue from aging research is a political economic and ethical question not a scientific one given human nature and existing institutional structures the benefits will almost certainly be enjoyed in a markedly unequal and unfair fashion greatly favoring the rich and powerful with only a very slow trickle down to the population at large this inequity has accompanied every previous technological advance in the long march of human progress and is not specifically disqualifying to progress in slowing aging and death me every scientific advance can and usually does have harmful unintended consequences medical social political economic that cannot possibly be predicted in advance scientists always have intellectual and financial conflicts of interest that bias them to exaggerate the potential benefits to be derived from their discoveries and to minimize the potential risks tyler surely aging research will have its hype blind alleys and unexpected complications these are an unavoidable risk in all scientific advances but the risks and difficulties should not paralyze efforts to make the advance or call into question whether it should be made instead they should increase caution and vigilance in how it is done and we must remember the context our world is already going to hell in a handbasket the risks of advancing science are real but the potential benefits may be all that stand between us and disaster science is necessarily disruptive but may offer our only road to salvation to quote mark watney in the movie the martian in the face of overwhelming odds im left with only one option im gonna have to science the shit out of this me there is something arrogant and unseemly about tampering with anything so fundamental to life as aging and death their inevitability has always been an essential element governing the ebb and flow of all the species and all the individual organisms that have ever lived on our planet why assume that we have the right or the need to tamper with such a basic aspect of nature tyler scientific progress has always challenged conservative values based on a sentimental attachment to the past my grandfather would probably have worked hard to convince the first agriculturalists that they were breaking some sacred and natural code when they chose to settle down in one place rather than continue following the hunt there is no inevitable inexorable overriding and natural law defining and governing one correct path of human destiny me curing disease is the primary goal of medical science but aging is not a disease it is an entirely expectable wearing down an expression of biological entropy that cannot be reversed we should certainly target the diseases that occur in old age in an effort to extend the average human healthspan success will improve the well being of the elderly and have a small subsidiary effect on lifespan eg more people living into their 80s 90s and 100s but we should not expect that better treatment for diseases will allow people to live to biblical ages despite the hype to the contrary there is no reason to believe it is scientifically feasible or ethically desirable for people to stay young for 150 years the most compelling lesson of scientific research is that the body is far more complicated and intricately balanced than we could possibly imagine we are still at a very early stage in curing disease there is no reason to think we can prevent decline or postpone death tyler it is far too early to tell whether aging in humans is more a reversible disease or an inescapable degenerative process but since aging is caused by biochemical processes it most likely can be prolonged by biochemical interventions we cant decide the question based on values and reasoning only by actually doing the aging research will we learn whether aging is preventable and sure it may take many decades but thats precisely why we have to allocate the resources now to get the project off to a fast start me unrealistic promises result in false incentives and misallocated resources typical example we are investing a vast fortune on the wildly unrealistic goal of eliminating dementia within a decade or two while taking dreadful care of the people who are already actually demented less hype would result in better balance between our hopes for the future and fulfilling our responsibilities in the present tyler aging is already a pressing current issue and will soon become the biggest medical problem of our future there is no running away or putting our head in the sand my goal is to make life longer and better for people sure there are some aging researchers who are overly enthusiastic in promoting their research and in promising quick results and we mustnt neglect the many practical problems of people who are aging today on the false hope that science will quickly and magically come to their rescue we must find a proper balance between research investments that will pay off only in the distant future and current health care investments for those who are in need today the future of our species depends on how we handle our demographics the way ahead is difficult and uncertain but that has never stopped us before we make lots of mistakes along the way but science helps us correct them there is no standing pat if we dont move forward we will move backward my reflections on the debate there is a disturbing myth from ancient greece aurora the immortal goddess of the dawn falls so deeply in love with a mortal man that she cannot accept losing him to death she pleads successfully with the olympian gods to grant him immortality but forgets to request that he also be gifted with perpetual youth her human lover is thus punished with the worst of fates interminable life daily made more intolerable by progressive aging and deterioration jonathan swift illustrated the same chilling issue in gullivers travels and also tragically in his own long tortured and undignified death from dementia modern medicine has cursed an increasing percentage of our aging population to suffer this miserable fate an artificially prolonged life preventing a natural and peaceful death medicine is so far much more advanced in keeping elderly people alive than in keeping them well our goal should be enhanced health not a longer existence if that existence is painful and has lost all meaning medicine should help people live well but also let them die peacefully and with dignity tyler is much more optimistic than i that we will soon have the technical means to prolong youth and postpone death and that we should use them i am more accepting of the limits of life eager to improve its quality rather than expecting to extend its duration tyler trusts scientists to make scientific decisions i believe that scientists have conflicts of interest that make them uniquely unqualified to judge the ethical implications of the scientific opportunities open to them if scientists can do something they will do it fairly heedless of unintended consequences tyler has the optimism and enthusiasm of the young i have the pessimism and caution of the old in a final flourish tyler trumped my argument that aging and death are somehow natural to the evolutionary scheme of things with the paradox that evolution has also given us the power to control aging and death and that surely we are programed to use it he is probably right i dont think our debate will be settled on ethical or theoretical grounds history provides precious few examples of a society voluntarily rejecting the application of a powerful new technology eg china burning its navy in the fifteenth century japan banning guns in the seventeenth but both were closed societies whose conservative decisions were governed by internal political concerns they were much less responsive than ours to economic and scientific competition and pressure my guess is that scientists will be given the freedom and the funding to follow every possible path to the fountain of youth and to doubling the lifespan if they succeed some chosen few of humanity will enjoy great benefits while the masses may suffer even more than they do today and our environment may decay even faster than it already has but i find aesthetic comfort in the firm belief that the scientists wont be able to deliver on their extravagant promises although our knowledge base is increasing exponentially the more we learn about the body the more we appreciate how difficult it is to translate basic science into clinical application our bodies are remarkably complex and carefully balanced machines scientists can tinker with them but i suspect that the basic cycle of life and death will be very hard to change allen frances is a professor emeritus at duke university and was the chairman

unholy alliance between cyberutopians moneylaunderers financial fraudsters and ultra freemarketeers what sort of toxic contraption might they dream up that would be bitcoin remind me what is the problem for which bitcoin is a supposed solution more on that in a moment for the time being the immediate bitcoin problem is that speculators in the virtual currency have been on a wild ride with the price of a bitcoin rising from under 1000 to as high as over 18000 and back down to 12000 before setting for the moment around 14000 this makes a few early bettors very rich but exactly what real economic good does that do okay in case you missed it heres the pitch paying with checks credit cards or bank transfers leaves a trail but there is no trail with bitcoin in a world of drug traffickers terrorists and kremlin weaponizing of all things cyber this is supposed to be a plus say what conventional forms of money other than cash have transaction costs your checkbook your credit cards not to mention digital forms of money transfer such as the paypal and venmo nick you for fees but there is no fee with bitcoin actually if you manage your money carefully you can reduce credit card and checking account fees to next to nothing thanks to its ingenious tamperproof blockchain cryptotechnology dont ask bitcoin is absolutely safe if you believe that i have a russian bridge for you to buy and unlike nasty governments which do things like managing the money supply or preventing destabilizing speculation bitcoin is independent of any government this is also billed as a plus in case you missed it check out the era of 19th century free banking in the us it was a time when tiny banks could create infinite amounts of credit the result was an era of euphoric credit booms followed by bank panics and depressions ah but the number of bitcoins in circulation is strictly limited to 21 million that was the claim anyway well there are now hundreds of other digital currencies and thanks to the miracle of leverage and speculation in bitcoins the true sum is far higher exactly how much higher we dont really know now in fairness central banks and bank regulators did a pretty good job of managing the money supply for half a century after the great depression and then they messed up big time in the 1980s regulators started getting captured by fintech wizardspeople not unlike bitcoin enthusiastswho started inventing new forms of infinite leverage it took about 20 years for this brew to become truly toxic the result was the collapse of 2008 we have a lot of work to do in order to return the business of financial regulation and good monetary policy to democratic control but if you think that task can be entrusted to an algorithm consider this its an old ideaeconomists milton friedman and friedrich hayek advocated putting the money supply on autopilot but if that policy had been in effect when the financial collapse of 2008 occurred and the economy had been left to the tender mercies of the invisible hand much less the invisible cyberhand all of the banks would have gone bust and the economy instead of experiencing the great recession would have been in total collapse ben bernanke a friedman enthusiast who was chairman of the federal reserve at the time acknowledged that a handsoff policy was the opposite of what was needed so the next time the wizards of speculation produce yet another financial collapse who ya gonna call bitcoin sorry theres nobody home i realize im in awkward company here the ceo of jpmorgan chase jamie dimon who helped bring us the financial collapse doesnt like bitcoin the big banks dont like the competition right no government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesnt have the same controls said dimon its not going to happen dimon is right that the worlds central bankers should shut down virtual currencies as both an invitation to money laundering and as a threat to monetary stability some central banks such as the bank of japan are planning to create official digital currencies for cheap or free transactions but in a context of regulated monetary policy europe has long had a less whizbang version of this known as giro transfers in which people instruct their banks to make payments on their behalf to vendors banks rather than writing checks and if the issue is more competition the remedy is to break up the big banks not to return to a digitized version of 19th century boom and bust credit creation i may agree with dimon on bitcoin i agreed with steve bannon on not going to nuclear war with north korea but that doesnt mean i support either bannons racism or dimons predatory banking in sum we should hardly be surprised that bitcoin is on a wild speculative ridethats the essence of privatized credit creation and if you think this gambling is zerosum and victimless kindly google these panic of 1837 panic of 1857 panic of 1873 panic of 1893 panic of 1907 and of course

continues', body='facebook ceo mark zuckerberg wants you to know hes super sorry and for the most part it really does seem like he means it so long as apologizing and trying to earn back users trust doesnt cut into company profits on wednesday afternoon the social media company made its founder available for questions from the media shortly after it announced plans to restrict who can access user data and to clarify how it uses that data in the first place at the same time facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm cambridge analytica from 50 million to as many as 87 million needless to say there was plenty to talk about heres a brief rundown of the bigger points of the conversation zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of russias misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow there is going to be more content that were going to find over time he said as long as there are people employed in russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems this is going to be a neverending battle you never fully solve security its an arms race he acknowledged facebook was behind during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts there hasnt been any meaningful impact by the movement he said but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment thats driving it even if we cant measure a change it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust facebook took cambridge analytica at its word that the company had in fact deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted zuckerberg didnt rule out the possibility of legal action against cambridge analytica but said facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when that said he acknowledged facebook cant just pass the blame onto cambridge analytica as facebooks tools enabled its behavior in the first place i think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility zuckerberg said were not just building tools but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well knowing what i know today clearly we shouldve done more and we will going forward hes into it with some reservations asked specifically if hed be willing to implement new privacy policies in the us similar to the strict new privacy laws rolling out in the european union zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format when the eu law takes effect on may 25 facebook will have to get users explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data zuckerberg said facebook intends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere not just in europe thats subject to some flexibility however a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter two reporters asked variations of this question and it seemingly caught him off guard the first time the second time he unhesitatingly said yes portraying the companys recent stumbles more as learning opportunities than farreaching mistakes when youre building something like facebook that is unprecedented in the world there are going to be things that you mess up and if wed gotten this right we wouldve messed something else up i dont think anyone is going to be perfect but i think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is nope zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question portraying a more profitable facebook as one thats fundamentally more useful to people as the site gets better at targeting users with morerelevant ads the more profitable it will be people tell us that if theyre going to see ads they want the ads to be good like most of the hard decisions we have to make this is one where theres a tradeoff between values that people care about on the one hand people want relevant experiences and on the other hand i do think theres some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads but i think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience zuckerberg broke this into three distinct categories each to be combated via different initiatives by the company the first category of bad actors he summed up as spammers who craft sensationalistic fake stories people click the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author often located in macedonia makes money simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content the second category belongs to russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion facebook is making progress here with moderate successes in the french and german elections but zuckerberg cautioned it will be a multiyear effort and the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself that shows up on facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that isnt really true even if the specific facts might be zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting broadly trusted journalism that does a fair and thorough job'}.

all the notable and noteworthy events that occurred that year this includes lists of prominent individuals who have died categorized by the fields in which they were prominent so you find lists of musicians actors writers even politicians who died that year published in nonspeciality publications in other words outlets like vanity fair are not the only publishers of lists of actors who died even the new york times and less prominent local news outlets publish these lists to be sure these individuals left an indelible mark and made a difference to scores of casual viewerslisteners and even connoisseurs but it has never failed to surprise me how little ink is devoted to scientists who have also left their mark on this world while scientific publications do devote vital space for these obituaries if conventional nonscience media also wrote about the passing of scientists it would be one small step in the direction of making science a more accessible professional option this year there has been much discussion on the unusually large number of celebrity deaths and as i write this there is news of george michaels passing one reason attributed to this larger number is because were at a time when pop culture icons who flourished in the 1960s are now well past their 70s and some having lived a hedonistic life have died earlier than others and while we deeply regret their passing we are able to look back and reflect on their impressive repertoire and the lives they touched through their works through these reflections and obituaries available from innumerable outlets there are many who are only now introduced to that impressive repertoire and its not uncommon that an artiste gains new followers upon their passing scientists by and large are unfortunately not afforded the same level of publicity not during their lives nor when they die even nobel laureates remain in the public eye at best in early october when the prizes are announced and december when the ceremonies occur how many people will be able to name the 2016 nobel laureates in physics chemistry or physiology and medicine and how many will be able to name the 2016 nobel laureate in literature i reckon the ratio will be 1001 in favor of remembering the literature laureate irrespective of whether you are familiar with bob dylans repertoire the scientists we lost this year made discoveries and influenced their fields to such an extent that not just their own research but also that of their peers has affected our lives while many prominent scientists died this year a case in point would be the passing of roger yonchien tsien tsien along with his coawardees osamu shimomura and martin chalfie was awarded the 2008 nobel prize in chemistry for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein gfp gfp or green fluorescent protein is protein found in jellyfish that is small enough to be engineered to be attached to cellular proteins without disrupting their activity to any appreciable extent this pathbreaking technology has been adopted in almost every life science laboratory and has enabled the development of a variety of biosensors using these biosensors our understanding of brain development and morphology has outpaced previous efforts in fact gfp based biosensors have been used to study every organ and the results have provided a basis for a deeper understanding of many diseases including cancer and it is only when we understand diseases that we can move to developing cures and arresting them susan lindquist was another visionary scientist who died this year from cancer in a profile by the scientist published in january 2016 lindquist said i like to do highrisk and highpayoff kind of research and i had a gut feeling that mit was a cool place to be with people who are fearless her area of research was studying how proteins fold within a cell and the cellular machinery recruited to shepherd the process of folding as well as folded proteins across the cell elucidating these steps is critical to understanding why these processes are disrupted in a number of diseases her research was also pivotal in enhancing our understanding of prion biology while this article is not intended to supply an exhaustive list of scientists who died in 2016 it is an effort to raise the question of why mention of scientists contributions when they die is restricted to obituaries alone and how integrating scientists in lists of deceased celebrities is important if we intend to give science its due place in society by promoting the accomplishments of scientists if not through the course of their lives at least in their deaths we will not only give them their due but also acquaint the public with the importance of their discoveries and the critical need to continue to fund basic scientific research this would be a good time to think about this as we wind down this wikipedia year of science'}.

unaware of intel on russia interference to boost trump', body='homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said tuesday she was unaware of any intelligence assessment concluding that russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to aid president donald trumps campaign even though the intelligence community concluded just that over a year ago reporters asked nielsen if she questioned a 2017 intelligence community assessment that russian president vladimir putin directed efforts to meddle in the presidential election to try and help president trump nielsen said she was unaware of that assessment which has been public for over a year i dont believe that i have seen that conclusion she told cnns manu raju that the specific intent was to help president trump win im not aware of that but i do generally have no reason to doubt any intelligence assessment nielsens comments come as top intelligence officials say russia is likely to meddle again and the department of homeland security is working with states to improve election security ahead of the 2018 midterms nielsen was on capitol hill tuesday with fbi director christopher wray and dan coats the director of national intelligence to brief members of congress on election security nielsen added that russia had attempted to target public confidence on both sides in 2016 and would continue to do so in the future weve seen them encourage people to go to a protest on one side weve seen them simultaneously encourage to people to go the same protest on the other side i think what they are trying to do is to disrupt our belief and our own understanding of whats happening she said its an integrity issue of who is saying what and why and how that may or may not affect american behavior in the 2017 assessment the fbi cia and nsa all agreed that russia interfered with a preference for trump we assess with high confidence that russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the us presidential election the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process denigrate secretary hillary clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for presidentelect trump the report said we also assess putin and the russian government aspired to help presidentelect trumps election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him all three agencies agree with this judgment it added last week the senate intelligence committee which has been investigating russian interference in the election for over a year affirmed the 2017 assessment from the intelligence community sen mark warner dva the ranking member of the committee on tuesday urged nielsen to read the 2017 report trump has not sent a clear message on election interference he has both said that russia interfered but also that he believed putins denial rep bennie thompson dmiss the ranking member on the house homeland security committee said in a statement he was shocked nielsen seemed unfamiliar with the report the fact that she did not seem aware of the reports findings while briefing members of congress on the very important topic of election security is appalling to all who have tried to make progress on this issue since 2016 with little help from republicans or this administration he said in a statement i sincerely hope the secretarys comments today were not just rhetorical gymnastics to placate the president tyler houlton a dhs spokesman said shortly after that nielsen was familiar with the 2017 assessment houlton added that she was not undermining it the secretary has previously reviewed the intelligence communitys assessment and agrees with it as she stated today and previously he said in a statement russian goals included undermining faith in the us democratic process and harming a candidates electability and potential presidency importantly they targeted both major political parties meanwhile senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky declined to answer questions about whether he agreed with the 2017 intelligence community assessment i dont have any observations to make about it mcconnell told reporters tuesday on capitol hill mcconnell also refused to weigh in on whether he thought it was appropriate for trump to intervene in a department of justice investigation especially one concerning him and his 2016 presidential campaign the president last week directed the doj to investigate claims that the fbi surveilled his campaign prior to the election the justice department in turn responded by asking its inspector general to look into trumps charge as part of an

united airlines', body='while its really all too common to find a corporate crisis in the headlines on any day i walk into my classroom to teach graduate students about the value of authentic communications yesterdays united airlines debacle was unfolding in real time at the start of class so my graduate students and i decided that whatever lecture i might have had planned could wait we projected twitter onto the board and began to analyze comments in hopes of understanding what this dreadful incident could show us about how to handle a corporate crisis and in the process we learned what a weak and disingenuous ceo statement can suggest about corporate values and culture first of course we watched the hideous video seeing a man beaten and dragged from his seat while shocked passengers wailed and videotaped from all angles left us speechless for a moment but as we watched the incident a second and third timeas most viewers will we arrived at the inevitable question how bad does the whole system at united have to be for things to spin this badly out of control this fast the answer of course was provided by united ceo oscar munoz himself in the form of a singularly bad public statement we found almost immediately on twitter many of the organizational and cultural woes at united were right there for all to see not just between the linesbut literally easily identified in every line of that statement so what can the munoz statement tell us wow in poker i believe they call this a tell the first line is an opportunity to convey authenticity empathy leadership and integrity but not here this opener suggests that at least as far as munoz is concerned this incident is first and foremost distressing to everyone at united really this may come as a bit of a shock to the innocent passenger who was the victim of the beating to his fellow passengers who were traumatized by the attack to the entire traveling public riveted by the viral video and anyone on the planet with access to twitter heres the reality virtually no one in the audience at whom this statement is directed cares about how unsettling this event is for everyone at united this opening line suggests an unwillingness to address victims of this incidentand might as well read we at united are primarily unsettled by bad publicity damn those cell phones with their video cameras a reasonable readers takeaway if an event like this doesnt cause some soulsearching at united nothing will im going to try to avoid united at all costs incredibly with this line the united ceo doubles down on his stubborn insistence that this incident is primarily about someone other than the passenger who was beaten apologizing to some other group of passengers doesnt even remotely achieve the objective of redirecting our attention from the bloody face of that poor man it only increases our realization that the ceo intends to misdirect rather than resolve indeed it also makes us more eager to know more about the victim the broken operational system and corporate culture that led to the attack and neither does injecting a stilted unhelpful verb like reaccommodate redirect our attention from the storm troopers if the first rule of a good communications strategy is authenticity then the first sign of a truly bad one is having to dig deep into merriam webster for a verb that is supposed to sound vaguely official but really suggests a desire for diversion and a lack of regard for the truth not to mention an absence of empathy a reasonable readers takeaway united is either not sorry or not in control of the situation as evidenced by this reaccommodation red herring after an incident like this one of the only ways to rebuild trust is to insist on an independent and open inquiry to identify weaknesses in a system that broke down so completely there is no real sense here that accountability or transparency are of great importance rather the focus on our own detailed review suggests that united thinks it may be qualified to get to the bottom of the situation on its own clearly were past that point a reasonable readers takeaway united will come up with some sort of story in coming days and victim blaming is quite likely but has no real intention of examining the culture that let this happen or overhauling the system that will practically ensure that it happens again munoz statement line 4 we are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation at last this neutral mention of the passenger and the situation comes too late to convey any empathy or outrage instead it just sounds like an obligatory nod to the elephant in the roomthe passenger with the bloody face who hasnt been mentioned at all so far by the ceo even though he is now a global star on twitter a reasonable readers takeaway if they would have talked directly to the passenger this never would have happened in the first place indeed if this happened to that passenger it could happen to me better to just avoid united beyond the general inadequacy of this statement as a tool for managing the crisis it also reveals profound weaknesses in policy values and culture at united there was clearly no holding statement ready or it wasnt used in anticipation of a crisis despite the chaos and complaints that arise from overbooking hundreds of times every day at an airline this begs the question if they dont have a contingency plan for utterly predictable customer service issues do they have contingency plans for safety security or mechanical problems one of the serious systemic issues this incident exposes and the scary questions it raises are about chaos about lack of managerial engagement and sloppiness that united will have to now answer forever but beyond systemic failure the apparent belief in the csuite at united that this ceo statement was either in line with the corporate values they say they demandintegrity competence respector compatible with a sustainable corporate culture that insists on transparency collaboration accountability and humanitysuggests there are moral bankruptcies that can precede financial ones one thing is for sure no one who read this statement came away with a sense that passengers are at the top of the united airlines priority list or possibly even on that list at all'}.

belle chasse thursday to discuss rams application for a coastal use permit from dnr the terminal will only add to respiratory problems we already have from a grain elevator and two oil refineries nearby fifthgeneration ironton resident audrey trufant salvant said last week were concerned about a railroad we hear they want to run along the mississippi and through the back of our town to carry coal trains could be running constantly right now the rail ends at the chs grain elevator north of us in addition to the ram terminal salvant and her neighbors have heard two more coal export facilities could be built nearby by other companies braithwaite is one of the sites under consideration salvant acknowledged that riverside industries provide local jobs but these facilities have to be maintained so that they arent choking us she said and too many of them close together isnt good driving down highway 23 salvant can see piles of coal at the international marine terminals two and a

center in davant and thursday at the belle chasse auditorium about fifty people turned out for the davant hearing according to scott eustis coastal wetland specialist at the gulf restoration network in new orleans thursday one concern discussed in davant was the possibility that coal trains will run south below where the rails end now at the chs grain elevator these trains could be up to 100 cars long carrying uncovered coal down through plaquemines filling the air with dust tying up vehicular traffic and making residents late for work and school eustis said thursdays belle chasse permit meeting attracted 120 people including ironton and myrtle grove residents who complained of asthma and allergies from existing riverside facilities nancy nusser of the clean gulf commerce coalition said friday people lined up to take the podium and no one from the public spoke in favor of the terminal during the fourhour hearing she said as for its coalexport ranking louisiana is the nations secondlargest shipper after virginia in data released by the national mining association in may the pelican state accounted for 20 percent of us coal exports in 2011 but the rationale for more coal export facilities was questioned at the davant meeting especially given pessimism about chinas imports eustis said in may goldman sachs predicted chinas imports will decline as that nations production of coal nuclear energy and wind power increases deutsche bank said this spring that chinas coal imports could soften because its urbanizing interior is near coal mines and away from coastal ports stan mathes plaquemines parish economic development director said last week that local coal terminals are gearing up for a wider deeper panama canal by 2015 and hope to meet chinese and indian demand he noted that some of indonesias coal exports are low quality and no longer acceptable to china as for india its coal imports continue to grow according to official indian statistics meanwhile rams application to operate awaits a water quality certification from louisianas dept of environmental quality and a compensatory mitigation plan in addition to the coastal use permit from the dnr according to ricky boyett us army corps of engineers spokesman in new orleans last week a compensatory mitigation plan is a wetland plan thats acceptable to the national marine fisheries service the us fish and wildlife service louisiana dept of wildlife and fisheries and the us environmental protection agency ram must first obtain a coastal use permit from the state and a 404 permit from the army corps before they may begin construction louisiana deq spokesman tim beckstrom said last week they will need a water permit from us but those other permits must be in place first deq gave ram an airquality permit last september a 404 permit authorizing construction in wetlands is issued by the army corps under section 404 of the clean water act in an april 30 2012 letter to new orleans engineers lanier and associateswhich was hired by ram terminals in 2011jerome zeringue executive director of the states coastal protection and restoration authority questioned whether rams terminal could exist with the states planned river diversion at myrtle grove he raised concerns about ship movement barge fleeting river piloting and the terminals impact on river sediments since then cpra has modeled potential impacts and analyzed and addressed issues zeringue said last week we now believe the two projects can coexist we will have enough room to operate near the proposed coal facility well be able to build and use the river diversion to create land in may 2011 ram acquired 602 acres on the lower mississippi river to develop its export terminal with fleeting operations because of cpras concerns that the coal terminal could affect its planned mid barataria sediment diversion a memorandum of agreement was drawn up identifying conditions under which rams facility can function this moa is in the process of being executed by the state and ram terminals with respect to rams coastal use permit application zeringue said last week under the moa ram wouldnt use its terminal during a peak operating period which can be declared by the state when the mississippi river is flowing at or above 600000 cubic feet per second at the us geological survey station at baton rouge during a declared pok cpra would capture as much sediment as quickly as possible to minimize the periods length a pok wouldnt exceed fifteen days in a row and no more than five of these peak periods could be declared in a calendar year when asked if possible air and water pollution from coal might impact the myrtle grove diversion zeringue said that will be a deq permitting issue deq should be able address any pollution concerns along the river he said cpras function with the diversion is to help rebuild and maintain our coastline zeringue provided a timeline for work on the diversion its in the design process as we progress through the permitting processall of which could take two years he said by summer 2015 the diversions design plans a required environmental impact study involving federal agencies and permitting should be complete after that construction may take another two years from the most optimistic projection the soonest the diversion can begin operating is probably five years from now the myrtle grove diversion is expected to create 33 square miles of wetlands in barataria basin zeringue said it will function as the mississippi river did when it built land before significant investments were made to channelize the river after the great flood of 1927 he said members of the clean gulf commerce coalition or cgcc fear the ram terminal will impact the river diversion and they hope the state denies the company its remaining permits cgcc includes the sierra club the gulf restoration network louisiana environmental action network the louisiana bucket

usually rides his bike to work tell our readers where you grew up and walk us through your background how did your family and surroundings influence you in your formative years i was raised by my iranian dad and american mother in the east bay area in california then i moved to tokyo for a couple of years where i lived with my paternal aunt i think living in the bay area in a multicultural household and then moving overseas contributed heavily to a sense of belonging to a global community and recognizing the wonderful things each culture brings to the table theres little doubt in my mind that one reason i love space exploration is that it can be a unifying force and experience for humankind what has been your personal key to success what were the biggest inspirations for your career im not sure im really successful yet i mean i am very fortunate to get to do this job but i think its mostly been trying to improve myself both personally and professionally i was lucky in that my first job connected me with some wonderful career mentors allowing me to gradually learn what i enjoy doing what i want from a career and not feel pressured into career moves i didnt appreciate that building robots to visit other planets was a job until shortly after graduating from high school in 1997 i watched the mars pathfinder land how did you end up working in the space program and how did you get on the mars curiosity team after mars pathfinder my path was pretty straightforward i started out thinking about majoring in physics instead of aerospace engineering and worked in a physics laboratory for most of my time at college i still love physics after graduating from the university of washington which had an aerospace engineering department i went to mit for a masters in the same field from there i was very lucky that a friend and classmate of mine ended up working at nasas jet propulsion laboratory first and helped me get my job curiosity ended up being mostly happenstance there was a job opening when i was hired and i started on it parttime until transitioning to fulltime after about a year you worked as a mission planner on nasas first nuclearpowered mars rover the curiosity one of the most technologically advanced mission to mars yet could you tell our readers about the challenges of controlling a robot on mars personally a lot of the challenge was this was the first time for me as an institution jpl has landed a number of missions on mars and quite a few members of the team had prior experience doing so so i tried learning from them what i could more often than not i learned how not to do things seems like most of our lessons learned tend to be this didnt work so well so lets try to do better next time even in our biggest successes technically one of the oftenoverlooked challenges besides the complexity of such missions is the time delay between earth and the spacecraft rover at launch the delay is seconds between command and the spacecraft acknowledgement but by the time we reached mars that was 14 minutes round trip the time it takes at the speed of light for our commands to get there to execute and then send back a response accordingly we had to build in a lot of autonomy theres no way to joystick a landing or even operate it from daytoday with that delay so the spacecraft and rover have to be able to execute things on their own without checkingin with humans what is the biggest challenge you have faced in your career selfdoubt while i consider myself extremely fortunate to work here with such incredible people the flipside of that coin is that sometimes its difficult to believe that i am at the same level what advice would you give to students who want to take the same career path as you do it its a very satisfying career just remember its not always easy so learn to make connections with other people in the same boat itll help you be a better engineer communication skills are crucial and itll help you when youre struggling how can our readers stay current on what youre doing now what are you exploring for the next few years i tweet a fair amount tweetsoutloud but really theres so much more going on at nasa and so i strongly recommend following as many of the nasaoperated accounts on social media i think were on every major one nowadays i personally enjoy nasa jpls nasajpl the most since it covers a lot of our robotic missions as well as earth sciences that im very proud of as for me i recently transitioned from what promises to be an incredible mission to jupiters moon europa to a joint earth science mission with indias space agency called nisar the opportunity to work with an international partner on a mission that can really impact our understanding of our world led me there what excites you most about the future of nasa well im always excited to visit places in our solar system or learn about exoplanets always with the hope that well learn were not alone in the universe but one of the most exciting things to me is that the future of nasa and the space industry in general there is the increasing collaboration with private industry and international partners hopefully this will allow the next generation of missions to represent even more of the world than ever so more people can participate your hairdo got the attention of the whole world during the landing how did you create that fabulous hair did you ever think you would become a meme what was it like to become an instant celebrity surreal i dont think anyone goes into nasa thinking one day ill be famous so i was caught offguard the emotions of the landing were a lot to deal with but i was very fortunate that the team was supportive and i am really proud to help represent the project and agency that i care deeply about my hair came from a tradition started a few years earlier of celebrating our major accomplishments with a different pattern in my hair for example system test 5 our 5th major test of the vehicle here on earth before launch led to a roman numeral v on the side of my head by the time of landing everyone on our team knew i was going to do something so my boss beat me to the punch sending out a survey to the team to vote on what my hair should look like what does being an iranianamerican mean to you for me it means i feel like a global citizen im proud of both my heritages but ultimately my allegiance is to helping to understand the context of what it means to be human and to help our planet and everyone on it its also a reminder to me that the future i want to see and that i am trying to create is one where we can better recognize we are all more the same than we are different i think that the perspective of space is one powerful way to do that'}.

the chains food safety crisis', body='more than a year has passed since chipotle mexican grill was hit with a series of food safety scares but the fastcasual chain has yet to bounce back from its problems in 2015 chipotle faced a series of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses including an e coli outbreak that spread across nine states a salmonella outbreak in minnesota and two separate instances of norovirus the crisis scared customers away and prompted big changes in the companys approach to food safety in its restaurants but many customers havent returned in response to stilldisappointing sales in the companys most recent quarter chipotle executives claimed in a conference call with investors last month that its struggles have more to do with customerservice issues long lines messy dining rooms ingredient shortages than with lingering concerns over the safety of its food according to a washington post report a new huffpostyougov poll complicates that narrative the poll conducted from dec 2122 found that just 36 percent of respondents said they were confident that the food served at chipotle is safe to eat while 24 percent of respondents said they were not confident in the foods safety another 40 percent said they were unsure the lack of confidence in the safety of chipotles food outpaced the 14 percent of respondents who said they were not confident that the food served in most restaurants is safe to eat when respondents were specifically asked if they believed chipotle was either safer or less safe to eat at than most other restaurants 21 percent of respondents said they believed eating at chipotle was less safe that number remained consistent even when the sample was narrowed to include just respondents who say they are customers of the chain 20 percent of whom also agreed that the food at chipotle is less safe than food at other restaurants these findings suggest that a significant number of chipotle customers still have concerns connected to the companys food safety scares in a statement provided to huffpost chipotle chief marketing and development officer mark crumpacker disputed that assessment stating that the companys extensive internal research has shown that brand trust and admiration have essentially recovered to precrisis levels the lagging sales crumpacker reiterated are due to customers less frequent visits not an outright avoidance the company believes subpar customer experiences at some of the chains locations is to blame the bottom line here is that there are many intertwined and complex reasons why we have not fully recovered our sales crumpacker added but the main reason is that our customers are not yet as frequent as they once were not because they are concerned about food safety for his part food safety expert and frequent chipotle critic doug powell said he believes the company is grappling as it places blame for its slow recovery away from its food safety struggles im not sure theyre focusing on the basics powell a former kansas state university food safety professor and the publisher and editor of barfblog told huffpost whether its food safety or employee retention or whatever it is though the cause of chipotles slow rebound might be debatable the chains feeble sales numbers are not the restaurants sales have continued their sag over the past four quarters and shares of the stock tumbled 6 percent last month when chipotle ceo and founder steve ells who was named sole ceo of the restaurant in december admitted he was nervous about whether the chain will achieve a previously forecast uptick in sales in 2017 shares of the stock have since rebounded but the chains outlook still remains uncertain the company is set to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2016

for climate negotiations', body='im writing this brief essay on board my flight to the usa from europe where i participated in a workshop at the center for european economic research zew in mannheim germany it was an interesting event the substance of which the energyefficiency paradox i will write about in the future but todays post is stimulated by a news article i read on board my flight titled us and china may find agreements outside stymied climate talks bad news from bonn in bonn this past week international negotiations continued under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the two most important countries in terms of greenhouse gas ghg emissions china and the united states apparently engaged in a war of words on the fundamental question of who should do what in particular these two giants and their respective allies in the developed and developing worlds bickered over their very different interpretations of the durban platform for enhanced actions call for an agreement to be reached in paris in 2015 that is applicable to all parties countries the united states and other industrialized countries have insisted that this calls for an agreement with emissions reduction pledges by all countries in particular by the industrialized countries plus the large emerging economies of china india brazil korea mexico and south africa but china india and most countries in the developing world have maintained that because the durban platform was adopted under the auspices of the unfccc it calls only for emission reduction commitments by the industrialized countries in previous essays at this blog ive written about the potential promise that the durban platform can offer for a departure from the paralysis that has characterized the past 15 years under the kyoto protocol with its dichotomous distinction between emissionsreductions commitments for industrialized annex i countries and no such commitments for other nations but it is difficult to claim that the rhetoric in bonn has been encouraging in that regard better news from beijing and washington at the same time us government officials back in washington were quoted in the news article i read on board my flight as saying that bilateral negotiations with china possibly outside of the unfccc are where real progress is most likely to be made this caught my eye because it may be the major and perhaps only cause for cautious optimism regarding the path ahead i wrote about this reality shortly after the unfccc negotiations concluded in warsaw poland in november 2013 and recent developments merit returning to it today my premise is what i perceive to be the potential emerging convergence of interests between these two most important countries in the world when it comes to climate change and international policy to address it china and the united states five factors stand out emissions historical responsibility fuel sources policy approaches and geopolitics emissions first the annual carbon dioxide co2 and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of these two countries have already converged whereas us co2 emissions in 1990 were almost twice the level of chinese emissions by 2006 china had overtaken the united states we are the worlds two largest emitters fuel sources third china and the united states both have historically high reliance on coal for generating electricity at a time at which us dependence on coal is decreasing due to increased supplies of unconventional natural gas and hence lower gas prices china continues to rely on coal but is very concerned about this partly because of localized health impacts of particulates and other pollutants importantly both countries have very large shale gas reserves us output and use for electricity generation has been increasing rapidly bringing down co2 emissions whereas chinese exploitation and output have been constrained by available infrastructure that is lack of pipelines but that will change policy approaches fourth in both countries subnational marketbased climate policies in particular capandtrade systems are moving forward in the case of the china seven pilot co2 capandtrade regimes at the local level are under development while in the united states californias ambitious ab32 capandtrade system continues to make progress and in the northeast the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi is witnessing higher allowance auction prices due to the more severe targets the rggi states recently adopted geopolitics fifth and finally there is the reality of global geopolitics if the 20th century was the american century then many observers including leaders in china anticipate or at least hope that the 21st century will be the chinese century in this regard im reminded that i was quoted by david jolly in the new york times as saying if its your century you dont obstruct you lead'}.

sex is still being criminalized', body='president donald trump posthumously pardoned jack johnson on thursday erasing the black boxers centuryold conviction for violating the mann act a 1910 law that prohibited transporting any woman or girl across state lines for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery or for any other immoral purpose by driving his white girlfriend from pittsburgh to chicago the timing of trumps decision was remarkable two months ago trump signed into law the bipartisan allow states and victims to fight online sex trafficking act fosta which holds websites accountable for any sextraffickingrelated content posted by users its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking but like the mann act fosta targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect it has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers those who are not trafficked used to screen clients and keep themselves safe although drafted and signed more than a century apart both laws are part of the united states long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex the mann act also known as the whiteslave traffic act was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men theres a huge range of things that the act allowed the government to punish and control alexandra levy a law professor at the university of notre dame told huffpost it gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage polygamy and promiscuity throughout the first half of the 20th century thousands of people were prosecuted under the act johnsons conviction in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery his crime was essentially being black and driving across state lines with a white woman even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend seven years after the mann act passed federal officials instituted the american plan to protect us servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in world war i the initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease it was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping american troops safe and for curing thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections though those cures often meant arsenic and mercurybased medicines and involuntary sterilization just like the mann act the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable like nina mccall a young poor white woman from michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute after her arrest she was forcefully examined and medicated then detained in a federal medical institution for three months in michigan alone more than a thousand women were detained under the plan by 1918 the mann act and the american plan were swift responses to changes in american culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women said scott w stern who recently published a book about the mccall case in the early and late 1910s women were getting the vote in various states women were beginning to get formally educated women were joining political parties and premarital sex was skyrocketing as was divorce he said both the mann act and the american plan were really about controlling women and especially workingclass and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming uncontrollable the mann act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men like charlie chaplin chuck berry and jack johnson stern continued certainly those are notable cases but what i think far too few people know is that the mann act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives the first people arrested by officers of the investigation bureau the justice department agency that would later become the fbi for violating the mann act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from michigan to chicago stern noted so while the mann act and the american plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women in practice the initiatives allowed the justice department to control them their sexuality and the men they associated with many of whom were black or chinese measures like the mann act and the american plan set the stage for legislation like fosta the law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade but much like the mann act and the american plan it polices members of already marginalized communities the new regulations pushed sites like craigslist and backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sextraffickingrelated content but sexrelated content in general that meant that not just sex traffickers but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground melissa a phoenixbased escort told huffpost that fosta forced her back onto the streets lexi a floridabased escort said she couldnt screen her clients anymore without access to the sites sex workers are often already members of marginalized communities lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence its an important parallel levy said the mann act and fosta used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities the mann act was passed unanimously stern said the house and senate versions of fosta passed almost unanimously the mann act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women similarly fosta used hysterical antitrafficking rhetoric often provided by evangelical christian organizations that oppose all sex work to garner support from the public the public is so easily manipulated when you say trafficking levy said its a very emotionally provocative issue you can sort of leverage that term in both cases the public was galvanized by terrifying and misleading anecdotes of sextrafficked children or white women only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law trumps decision to pardon johnson shows progress but johnsons story also offers an important lesson levy argued it should call our attention to the fact that laws that purport to be antitrafficking can mask very serious social agendas she said hopefully we can learn from this'}.

safety and well being', body='i have always hated involuntary psychiatric treatment it is demeaning to human dignity subject to abuse and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend but there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil preferable to the risks of suicide violence jail or homelessness my first experiences in psychiatry occurred fifty years ago at a time when 650000 patients were warehoused in psychiatric hospitals accurately described as snake pits i very much admired tom szasz for calling this out and fighting to free patients from their bondage some of my own earliest writings were directed against psychiatric paternalism emphasizing instead the great value of eliciting patient preferences and of negotiating rather than dictating their treatment plans and in many years of emergency room work my instinct was almost always on the side of taking reasonable risks letting most people go when they insisted rather than playing it safe by forcing them into a hospital stay but there are exceptions people with severe and chronic mental illness who are an ongoing clear and present danger to self family andor the public but who lack the insight or volition to get the help needed to reduce what is otherwise an unacceptable risk how do we achieve an equitable balance between the sometimes competing values of freedom and safety involuntary commitment to inpatient psychiatric hospitals has become very uncommon in the us because almost all psychiatric hospitals have been closed 90 comprising 600000 beds in the last 50 years completely not coincidentally the concomitant failure to provide adequate community treatment and housing has resulted in an equivalent 600000 people with severe mental illness being housed in jails or left homeless on the street this neglect has made the united states for many people the worst place in the world to have a severe mental illness httpswwwpsychologytodaycomblogsavingnormal201512worldsbestandworstplacesbementallyill fortysix states have adopted assisted outpatient treatment aot statutes in an attempt both to improve the lives of the severely ill and also to reduce risk among those who are at highest risk if their severe mental illness goes untreated courtordered treatment is applied only rarely and only for people who meet strict legal criteria of risk and lack of insight i write about this issue now in response to a recent paper by barnes and badre is the evidence strong enough to warrant longterm antipsychotic use in compulsory outpatient treatment httppspsychiatryonlineorgdoiabs101176appips201500408 these authors argue against the use of involuntary medication in aot programs because the existing literature is insufficient to prove longterm efficacy beyond one year drs barnes and badre have confused two nonrelated issues the riskbenefit of longterm antipsychotic use with its use in short term aot programs the duration of court mandated outpatient treatment is generally brief in 22 states initial aot orders are limited to 90 days or less in 15 others they are limited to 180 days or less and even with renewals 35 states allow orders of up to no more than one year in the state of new york 45 of orders are not renewed at the end of 6 months only 39 remain in the program for more than one year and only 25 for more than 30 months httpbiomhnygovaotstatisticspcourtorderrenewals most people in aot convert successfully to voluntary treatment within a year many who were unhappy when originally ordered into outpatient care later feel grateful once they have been helped by it studies show that aot improves symptoms and functioning and reduces hospitalizations arrests and violence httpdhmhmarylandgovbhddocumentsmorrissey_opc_final_report_201104131pdf the barnesbadre argument about the lack of literature supporting long term antipsychotic treatment doesnt apply to most people who are in aot only on a short term basis it has more relevence to the 25 or so of cases in which court mandated outpatient treatment is extended for a longer period of time because it is impossible to extend placebo controlled studies for indefinite periods we will probably never have conclusive evidence on long term risks vs benefits of antipsychotic meds but shorter term randomized clinical trials show unequivocally that antipsychotic medicine dramatically reduces relapse rates during the first year after an episode httpmhuffpostcomusentrysettingtherecordstraig_23_b_9243828html for people with a history of severe persistent and dangerous relapses the real risks of antipsychotic medicine are often outweighed by the substantial benefit protecting individual freedom is a great social good but protecting personal and public safety is an equally compelling social good it is no gift to a psychotic individual to protect his freedom to refuse much needed treatment if the immediate consequence is his harming himself or others or winding up in jail for a nuissance crime or being left derilict and homeless court mandated treatment is usually short its benefits are often long aot laws provide legal recognition and protection of the patients right to refuse treatment but stipulate that this right is not absolute mandated treatment is permitted for specified usually brief periods only when the patients judgment is severely and manifestly impaired and when his refusing treatment will lead to terrible consequences the risks of illness must be very great and must clearly exceed the very considerable risks posed by antipsychotic meds unfortunately enforced treatment has become a polarizing issue that is often discussed in ideological terms as if there is a universal right answer in my experience people who seem to differ in theory agree much more in practice when discussing the specifics of any given situation eleanor longden of hearing voices and i have had very different experiences of psychiatry but agree completely on a common sense approach that places the highest value on free decision making except in the very most extreme circumstances

the goal of ending mass incarceration billionaire george soros who backed krasners election in 2017 with a 145 million donation is investing in other district attorney races across the nation this cycle the american civil liberties union which received grant funding from soros open society foundations in 2014 to support criminal justice reform is planning voter education and outreach programs in as many as 10 states and political action committees like real justice and color of change are directly intervening in key races soros the aclu the two pacs and a constellation of allied statelevel groups hope that by organizing activists educating voters and dumping money into district attorney races across the country they can slowly start to replace more of the countrys 2400 top prosecutors with reformers like krasner they also aim to change the way the public views elections for district attorneys who are some of the most powerful people in the criminal justice system the groups have targeted races in about a dozen counties that collectively contain around 5 percent of the us population real justice endorsed krasner in the philadelphia da election last year the group works to elect reformminded prosecutors around the nation and is hoping to be deeply involved in about 15 races in 2018 activist and writer shaun king the groups cofounder told huffpost last week this year real justice has raised about 1 million in funding according to the federal election commission king said he expects the group to use every dollar and staff member it has in those 15 races real justice has already announced endorsements for six district attorney candidates four in california and two in texas the political action committee arm of color of change the longtime civil rights advocacy group has raised about 2 million according to the fec and has announced endorsements for three district attorney candidates one of the reformers favored candidates has already lost both real justice and color of change backed judge elizabeth frizell who was running for district attorney in dallas county texas she came in second in the countys democratic primary in march and has since filed a lawsuit alleging that voter fraud cost her the win but tuesday night two black reformminded candidates in north carolina former criminal defense attorney satana deberry in durham county and former assistant district attorney faris dixon in pitt county both of whom are backed by color of change won their democratic primary elections were starting to send a message were starting to get phone calls from das around the country asking us about our demands were getting calls from candidates said rashad robinson executive director of color of changes nonprofit civil rights organization and spokesman for the groups political action committee arm and as an organization that couldnt get das to return our calls this is the power of actually being engaged in the democracy this way the political action committee expects to be involved in five to seven more races in various states this election cycle robinson said theres a lot more to come robinson said part of our work is building the kind of longterm cultural power and conversation around this office so that das know that all over the country people are watching and that communities have the power to turn out and kick them out if they arent serving them its also an opportunity for das who do want to do the right thing want to be reformminded to actually be on the right side of history real justice selects candidates to support based on a questionnaire the first question uses a fivepage guidance memo krasner distributed to his office in february as a litmus test it asks the candidates to list the policies from that memo they would not implement during their first 100 days in office the dozens of other questions ask for the candidates stances on mass incarceration the drug war the death penalty police accountability and corruption color of change has six national demands it expects district attorneys to support end money bail stop putting children in adult jails and prisons stop unnecessary prosecutions of lowlevel offenses stop antiimmigrant prosecutions hold police accountable and practice transparency about their offices but the groups have ambitions far beyond simply endorsing candidates they want to educate and change minds color of change is doing voter outreach in local communities telling people about the role a district attorney plays and the records and campaign platforms of various candidates all in an effort to get black voters to turn out in da elections real justice meanwhile is in the process of building out regional volunteer teams in all 2400 districts that elect their top prosecutors building that new system out will take a big chunk of this year king said ultimately what were trying to do is have a massive educational effort so people know that

criminal justice reform movement we often think of bad cops horrible incidents of police brutality but at the heart of all of it is 2400 district attorneys king said most local people cant describe their da or its functions its a system that operates in the shadows and they have sweeping powers to run the local justice system king is right prosecutors are among the most powerful government agents in the american criminal justice system they have complete and unrivaled access to the evidence that can determine a persons guilt or innocence they have broad powers over how seriously to take a charge against an individual and how aggressively they are willing to pursue a case they can cut deals with witnesses coconspirators and defendants and they can pile on charges to produce sentences to strongarm someone into taking a plea deal prosecutors determine the charges a defendant will ultimately face and set the parameters for the eventual punishment a person might receive americas elected prosecutors do not reflect the diversity of the jurisdictions they serve ninetyfive percent of elected prosecutors are white and 79 percent are male only 1 percent of prosecutors are women of color and the majority of prosecutors 85 percent run for election unopposed prosecutors are also rarely punished for misconduct the cases that have led to disbarment or even criminal charges are few and far between and in the end they are largely shielded from any liability that might result from their actions thanks to a supreme court ruling granting them absolute immunity from civil suits progressives efforts in 2018 prosecutorial elections could represent a turning point said miriam krinsky a former federal prosecutor and executive director of fair and just prosecution a group that works with more than a dozen recently elected reformminded prosecutors to help them accomplish the goals they campaigned on were watching this election season closely because we know that this group of new elected das with a different vision for the justice system is likely to expand in number krinsky said we know in the past that most das are not just reelected they often have no opposition at all so theres not even an airing of critical issues for the public she added thats changing given the enormously influential role of prosecutors in controlling the front door to the justice system

undocumented immigrants from census count', body='alabama is suing the trump administration to force the census bureau not to count undocumented people as part of the decennial tally used to determine how many seats in congress each state gets the suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants in a statement rep mo brooks rala one of the plaintiffs in the suit said apportionment should exclude immigrants and be based on only the citizen population rep steve king riowa and kansas secretary of state kris kobach r have made similar calls missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population last week the top official in the department of justices civil rights division said the trump administration had no position on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population every 10 years the census counts all people in the united states regardless of their immigration status and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets the 14th amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of persons but in a suit filed tuesday in federal court in alabama brooks and the states attorney general steve marshall r argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries the word persons would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country they argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census in march the commerce department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950 civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups the results of the census have significant consequences in addition to determining how many house seats each state gets the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated the suit seeks to block a census rule directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the united states at the address where they live or sleep most of the time the plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th amendment by robbing the people of the state of alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens legal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuits foundational claim that the word persons was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants franita tolson a law professor at the university of southern california and a scholar of the 14th amendment said she was unaware of any historical support for alabamas argument she said the legislative history surrounding the 14th amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word persons to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens to say that alabamas argument is a stretch is being overly generous she wrote in an email the text says persons and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly michael ramsey a law professor at the university of san diego noted that the founders added a clause to article i section 2 of the constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets if the founding fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the united states he said they could have added a clause to explicitly say so pamela karlan a professor at stanford law school pointed to information on the website of united states customs and immigration services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was relatively free and open it wasnt until 1875 that the us supreme court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration and it wasnt until 1880 that congress began to enact immigration legislation at the time of the founding there simply wasnt a category of undocumented immigrants she wrote in an email john thompson a former director of the census bureau noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally census officials he said cant simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the united states and expect to get an accurate count the suit offers no method for the census bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents mike lewis a spokesman for marshall dismissed the practical concerns it is important to know who is here both legally and illegally our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census he said in a statement there are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status we will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation jeffrey wice a washington lawyer who has worked with democrats on redistricting issues said the case could go to the supreme court he added that it was fiction that the founding fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census whoever filed the suit did not think this through he said'}.

was free of arrests involuntary psychiatric commitments or anything else that might automatically disqualify him from owning firearms under federal law he could have walked into a gun store filled out a form and walked out with a weapon in less than an hour but he couldnt do that in massachusetts because the state requires wouldbe buyers to get a permit first that means going through a much longer process and undergoing a lot more scrutiny each applicant must complete a fourhour gun safety course get character references from two people and show up at the local police department for fingerprinting and a oneonone interview with a specially designated officer police must also do some work on their own searching department records for information that wouldnt show up on the official background check if the police come to believe an applicant is a possible threat to public safety they can refuse to grant the permit and that is what happened in the case of this man from newton police records showed eight visits to his home from 2008 to 2012 each time in response to calls from family members concerned about his behavior on one occasion according to the police account the man had punched a picture frame and lacerated his hand another time he had been wielding a knife and threatening to commit suicide officers took the man into protective custody after three of the visits the reports said and at nearly all of them he was intoxicated this december following a procedure that massachusetts law lays out newtons chief filed a fivepage memo with a state district court it summarized the incident reports one by one and concluded that the man had exhibited or engaged in behavior that could potentially create a risk to public safety the man who declined to comment for this article and whose name huffpost is not publishing challenged the police decision in court as the law allows applicants to do a written filing stated that he has completed treatment for alcohol addiction as a physician independently confirmed it also said that he has a steady job and noted that there have been no incidents since 2012 a district judge considered the argument and a few weeks later upheld the police departments decision the man from newton is now appealing that decision but whether or not he ultimately gets his permit his story illustrates just how aggressively massachusetts regulates gun ownership no other state requires a permit for any kind of gun purchase while also giving police some discretion to deny those permits the combination could help explain why the states mortality rate from firearms incidents is relatively low according to some experts who have studied these types of laws that makes the massachusetts permit system a potential model for legislation in other states or even the country as a whole at a time when the massacre at a high school in parkland florida has put gun violence back on the political agenda but replicating the massachusetts program would require persuading or overcoming resistance from gun rights advocates starting with the members of the national rifle association who are meeting in dallas this weekend they are convinced that permit systems like the one in massachusetts do little to deter violence while doing a lot to undermine the second amendment massachusetts has required that gun owners get permits since 1968 although initially the state approved permits automatically for anybody without major crime convictions or other disqualifying factors in the parlance of gun control it was a shall issue system rather than a may issue system in which officials or law enforcement would have had leeway to deny licenses in certain circumstances that changed in 1998 when state lawmakers gave police broad discretion to withhold handgun licenses for people who were in the police departments judgment unsuitable in 2014 following the massacre at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut massachusetts lawmakers led by house speaker robert deleo strengthened its gun laws yet again expanding police discretion so that it applied to rifles and shotguns too the permit process for rifles and shotguns is slightly different than the process for handguns but they lead to the same basic result today police can deny ownership of any kind of firearm subject to court review that made massachusetts unique the other two states with police discretion over ownership new jersey and new york apply that method only to handguns the 2014 law also clarified somewhat when and how police in massachusetts should use their discretion by law the police can restrict a license or deny one outright anytime they have credible evidence that somebody may pose a threat to public safety the credible part is supposed to keep the police from acting arbitrarily police actually have to file papers with a local court justifying denials the may part is supposed to make it clear that the police can limit or withhold a license anytime they believe a mere threat exists they dont have to wait until they are certain or even nearly certain an applicant would use a gun for crime or selfharm one way to think of the system is that it places the burden of proof for denying a license on the police while making it clear that the proof does not have to be overwhelming and although the state still does not specify exactly what constitutes a threat and what doesnt thats precisely the sort of judgment call best left to city and town officials supporters of the law say gun violence is usually local among people who know each other john rosenthal cofounder of the organization stop handgun violence and a longtime advocate for tighter gun laws said in an interview with huffpost who better than the local police chief to issue renewable licenses and be able to have that discretion every six years many experts agree local police chiefs typically know more about the people in their community than does a national computer david hemenway a wellrespected gun violence researcher at harvard told the trace even with the new system in place the vast majority of people who apply for licenses get them according to a 2017 evaluation that a panel of experts conducted for the states executive office of public safety and security but 1 to 3 percent do not depending on the year the panel determined that number doesnt account for the people who dont even try to get licenses because they know police would not grant them and even among those residents who get licenses many will have restrictions on how they may use their guns they might not have freedom to carry a firearm outside the home for example except for transporting it to firing ranges or hunting grounds this is one way in which the massachusetts practice is more typical many states give the police discretion over who gets to carry a gun outside of the home in general police from rural parts of massachusetts are a lot less likely to issue restrictions than the departments in cities and surrounding suburbs according to a compilation of 2016 statistics by commonwealth second amendment which advocates for gun rights police say such differentials are largely a byproduct of the very different way departments operate depending on the size and closeness of their communities most people we know one way or another its a neighbor or a neighbors friend or coworker or somebody you deal with on the job luann czapala the firearms officer in ware said during an interview at the citys headquarters ware a former mill town in the rural area between worcester and springfield has a population just shy of 10000 very few people who come in and apply have anything in their background that would cause a problem thats not to say it never happens the ones who get our attention czapala said are the ones weve had to see before to come to their houses with incidents that dont rise up to arrests but tell us hey something is not right here gee weve been to this house so many times and in that respect the process is quite similar to newtons the big difference is that george mcmains the lieutenant who handles firearms permits there may have to investigate applicants by for example calling neighbors or family thats because in a city whose population is just under 90000 mcmains is less likely than czapala to know the applicant personally mcmains said investigating incident reports is especially important for revealing histories of domestic violence because even repeated visits can result in no formal charges and thus no automatic disqualifications for gun ownership even under the unusually tight standards massachusetts has in place its not surprising he would say that in a 2013 survey massachusetts police departments said incidents of domestic violence were among the most likely reasons for them to restrict or deny a license or to suspend one they had approved at the same time mcmains said police officers work hard to distinguish between somebody arrested for disorderly conduct when he was in college on a friday night 15 years ago versus somebody who has a record of being involved with domestic situations with his significant other mcmains who has been handling newtons permits for two years says that is one reason every license rejection during his tenure has held up in court that goes to show that the chief does put a lot of thought into his denials mcmains said gun homicides and suicides still happen in massachusetts in part because people without licenses still manage to get guns but gun violence happens a lot less frequently than it does in most states adjusted for age and population the gun fatality rate in massachusetts for 2016 was the lowest in the us and thats how its been for most of the last 30 years although sometimes another state like hawaii ends up with a slightly lower rate just how much that low rate has to do with the states gun laws is a matter of ongoing debate even among experts pretty much any legitimate study is going to rely on assumptions that will be open to valid criticism separating out cause and effect can be virtually impossible but the available research provides a good reason to think massachusetts laws in general and the permit system in particular have made violence less likely some of the most widely cited work by daniel webster of johns hopkins university has focused on two states that have had similar albeit weaker permit schemes missouri which got rid of its license program a decade ago and connecticut which added one in the 1990s using a variety of methods designed to estimate what might have happened if those states hadnt changed their laws webster and his colleagues concluded that getting rid of gun licenses in missouri led to more gun violence while introducing licenses in connecticut led to less additional research including a study the journal of urban health published last month has shown that gun crimes in states with permit schemes tend to involve guns that criminals obtained more easily elsewhere that suggests the laws are at the very least forcing wouldbe perpetrators to change their behavior it also suggests permit systems could have a bigger effect on violence if more states had them police officials in massachusetts make that argument all the time its crazy that some states just give out these guns with very few requirements william evans commissioner of the boston police and a champion of tighter gun laws said in an interview we have tough gun laws here and to me it makes a difference evans said but if we had them nationally if other states had universal background checks and strong licensing like our state does there would be less violence the other big question about the massachusetts system is the constitutional one the supreme court in a controversial 2008 ruling known as dc v heller upheld the governments ability to regulate firearm possession and usage but it also recognized for the first time a constitutional right to gun ownership to jim wallace executive director of the gun owners action league and outspoken critic of massachusetts regulations the states licensing system clearly infringes on that right we always have to be careful about how much authority we give to law enforcement wallace said their jobs god bless them is to enforce the law not decide on somebodys civil rights jason guida an attorney and former state firearms official who now represents people appealing license denials has a similar view once we go down the road of giving police discretion we are not just stepping on the other side of that line we are jumping over it and dancing guida represents that man from newton who is appealing his license denial and he thinks the case is an example of how the law gives police too much authority when the man wrote a letter requesting the gun permit he addressed his history with police headon guida noted the incidents all occurred during a difficult period in his life the man wrote and since that time he has stayed dry gotten a steady job and even done volunteer work at a local food bank he also promised to use the gun lawfully saying he wanted it only for bird hunting and target practice most of my clients have never been convicted never even been charged with a crime but a chief has decided that they are not safe with firearms guida said thats the rub right here how massachusetts may have gone beyond what the second amendment allows supporters of the massachusetts law see things differently public safety is a constitutionally permissible reason for restricting gun ownership they say and local police are ideally situated to make that call at least initially in the context of gun rights where the supreme court has said limitations based on public safety principles are appropriate we want law enforcement to make those decisions because they are the ones on the ground who see the behavior hannah shearer a staff attorney at the giffords law center said there is also the appeals process which can serve as a safeguard for constitutional rights although police discretion over gun ownership can be constitutionally problematic says adam winkler a ucla constitutional law professor if more than 90 percent of applicants are getting permits there is an appeals process in place and government has to provide actual evidence thats reviewed by a neutral arbiter that seems to me a system that the courts might uphold no right is absolute heller makes that clear winkler who is the author of the book gunfight the battle over the right to bear arms in america added if the question is should there be enough discretion to target certain behaviors that fall short of criminal conviction but are highly probative of danger from firearms a court is likely to say that kind of review is acceptable in washington a handful of lawmakers have held up the massachusetts system as a prototype for the rest of the country one of them is the states junior democratic senator ed markey who has sponsored a bill that would give states strong financial incentives to introduce their own licensing programs the involvement of police chiefs in the licensing process is key markey said at a news conference in march when he formally unveiled the proposal we cant overstate that enough democratic lawmakers from other states with their own variations on permit systems including connecticut maryland and new jersey have introduced similar measures those lawmakers have a lot of work to do gun violence is getting more political attention than at any time since 2013 and the aftermath of the sandy hook shootings which not coincidentally is the last time congress came close to passing meaningful gun legislation and if the odds of enacting significant new measures now are long they will improve if supporters of tighter gun laws win more seats in congress starting with this years midterm elections but most of the focus so far has been on banning assaultstyle weapons or extending background checks to private sales the two ideas that have gotten the most attention in the past although many experts believe these measures can also help theres reason to think that they would work best in combination with a fullfledged permit system that involved police discretion state lawmakers in massachusetts appear to agree the state already has a ban on many assaultstyle weapons and it already applies its laws to all sales not just those that licensed dealers make thats actually one reason advocates think a permit system could win over some gun rights advocates it spares private dealers the administrative hassle of performing background checks all they have to do is check for the stateissued permit now many of the same lawmakers responsible for the 2014 law are looking to build on it they are pushing for a red flag law in which family members could ask judges to issue emergency restraining orders when they fear a loved one is about to commit an act of violence these orders would automatically suspend any existing gun licenses and allow police to seize weapons although this would be a separate policy from the permitting system the underlying impulse is the same to identify people likely to hurt themselves or others and keep guns out of their hands before it

kull has sent the following letter to me in response to one of the organizers of the upcoming royal society public meeting on paradigm shift attempting to censor my coverage of the event kalevi kull plans to attend the november gathering in london dear suzan well i really interpret the letter you refer to in your article censorpship upcoming royal society evo meeting as evidence that this is a paradigm shift because it focuses not on the biological theory itself but on social matters in academia and this is a serious hint because if this kind of deep change happens then very many scientists face a problem of how to survive this change because the new dominant model they would like to accept results in many of their previous writings losing much of their value nobody wants to belong to the party of losers one of the best strategies in such a case is evidently an interpretation of the change as a gradual accumulation of knowledge while their work has always been at the cutting edge following is the censorship email kull refers to above it was not written by denis noble could i request that you stop referring to the forthcoming rsba meeting new trends in evolutionary biology biological philosophical and social science perspectives and to the extended evolutionary synthesis more generally as in some way advocating a paradigm shift such language is both misleading the vast majority of scientists working towards an extended synthesis do not seek revolutionary change in neodarwinism and counterproductive such talk undermines calm scientific discussion by creating an unnecessarily emotive and antagonistic atmosphere i view the kuhnian model as superseded long ago the data suggests that sciences rarely if ever change through revolutions lakatos framework of research programmes offers a more uptodate accurate and useful conceptualization of gradual and progressive scientific change the extended evolutionary synthesis is best regarded as an alternative research programme entirely complementary to orthodox evolutionary biology talk of paradigm shift gives the false impression that the differences amongst evolutionary biologists are far more extreme than they actually are kalevi kulls correspondence continues is this a radical change in biology what is going on now the contrast is quite clear if we look at how evolutionary innovation is described either innovation begins from a new mutation followed by newly behaving phenotype which is amplified by natural selection this is what the neodarwinian model suggests or innovation begins from a change of function with habitat choice or resource choice etc first stabilised by epigenetic or ecological inheritance and followed by fixation due to mutational noise which is what the new model states let us call it the postdarwinan model that is either a genetic change first followed by functional change or a functional epigenetic ie nongenetic change first followed by genetic changes the details of this contrast are described for instance in my work adaptive evolution without natural selection published in the linnean society journal but there are many scholars who share this model that paper provides a row of references isnt it a deep contrast and a possible move from one to another a radical change of the major model of evolution however if indeed one knows all the dramatic history of the theory of evolution heres a sketch estonia has been described as a country with one of the richest political experiences we also see this in our history of darwinism in the 19th century tartu university was one of the leading germanlanguage universities and one of the leading critics of darwin was working at tartu university karl ernst von baer the founder of developmental biology simultaneously one of the very first courses in the world and best textbooks written about darwinstime darwinism was provided by a professor at the same university georg seidlitz around the turn of the century before wwi tartu university was a russianlanguage university and darwinism was soon popularised as supporting early socialist ideas soon after together with advances in genetics evolutionary theory was interpreted as a basis for eugenics also used in this way by national socialists in germany before wwii then estonia was annexed by russia and after the wwii for more than a decade it meant the influence of vulgar darwinism also called creative darwinism at that time as propagated by lysenko yes he also praised darwin he just did not like genetics in the 1970s and 80s all students in the soviet union had to learn how darwinism goes hand in hand with marxism meaning a good connection with the synthetic theory of evolution which was a synonym for neodarwinism simultaneously a radical nondarwinism was also developing within certain circles of soviet biologists who took it from the theory of nomogenesis of lev berg and his follower alexander lyubischev after the collapse of the soviet union an outgrowth of neodarwinism called sociobiology became a dominant view for many particularly among zoologists if one has read all this and been able to understand why all these scholars had the views they had it is hardly possible to describe this history as gradual improvement of a model continuous extension of a synthesis there have rather been different paradigms existing and developing in parallel most of the time just one of them was strongly dominant over the other and since evolutionary theory has almost always been tied to some ideological battles its changes were not limited by scientific discoveries nevertheless we have good friends and colleagues whose views about evolution we do not share but should we therefore be less strict in our formulations about our views no that would mean giving up our understanding good teachers wouldnt do so science deeply speaking is the mutual help in understanding we should help each other as friends nobody is understanding everything keeping this in mind the best way to make our thoughts clear is to use formulations that do not hide meaning a better understanding is not always an extension of the earlier model sometimes it is an alternative in other words summarizing claiming that what is going on is just an ongoing extension of darwinism would be equivalent to saying that einsteinian physics is just an extended newtonianism why not one may describe it so however the einsteinian change became a classic example of a paradigm shift for kuhn i like very much your writings

canada in tapping the bottom of the barrel', body='while record numbers of protesters were chaining themselves to construction equipment earlier this week along the oklahoma segment of the keystone xl pipeline the proposed plan to ferry canadian tar sands to refineries on the us gulf coast another group of activists camped out at 8000 feet on an eastern utah plateau their target a lesserknown tar sands project here at home a canadian company named us oil sands is poised to launch the nations first tar sands mining operation at pr springs not far from arches and canyonlands national parks tapping the energy resource supporters say will be a boon for utahs local economy and the countrys energy security while posing few negative consequences given the remoteness of the operation opponents however fear real impacts on local wildlife and tourism as well as downstream effects on already polluted air and the continually dwindling supplies of clean water upon which millions of people in the west rely we dont need to do this said celeste bradford 10 standing at the us oil sands site with other kids a few picking at rocks coated in tar she suggested that if people raised solar panels instead we wouldnt have to be polluted anymore its amazing how smart children are and what they do realize said raphael cordray who brought two nieces and a nephew on the trip to pr springs an area already dotted with oil and gas wells and nearby experiments in another unconventional fossil fuel oil shale cordray had known about keystone xl but when she realized that the tar sands issue was also as she said something personal to utah she took action she now leads an activist group utah tar sands resistance from salt lake city the wasatch front the metropolitan corridor in which salt lake city and other populous utah towns are located already has some of the worst air in the country during the winter due in part to oil refineries and the pollutiontrapping topography of the mountain valley adding tar sands development with its attendant diesel trucks and local refining will exacerbate the problem opponents argue this stuff is the bottom of the barrel said cordray noting the heavy oil requires more refining in a process that releases more pollutants into the air than that for conventional oil we could catch up with china thats not even a joke while standing on an aspenfilled ridge near the mining site she described to the huffington post the wild scene around her roaming deer and wild turkeys grazing cows and birds flying through blue skies but just over the hill you can see it she said referring to the us oil sands land theyve done a lot of clearing and are widening the road down here the mining operation has yet to begin although the local government appears to be literally paving the way us oil sands has approximately 32000 acres under lease with initial permits to mine 213 of those acres and the county is spending public money to widen and pave a road needed to access the companys site now is the time to get everyone to look at canada added cordray she said she hopes that awareness of the reported damage associated with tar sands mining in alberta will incite further resistance in utah and ultimately stop us oil sands before it gets started theres no question that this is bad for air for water for animals she said less than a mile away from the us oil sands test pits one previously used as a trial mine others dug to harvest donations of gravel for the county road lies an abandoned tar sands experiment from the 1980s according to emerson urry editorinchief of environews usa he filmed at the site as his reporter tried in vain to rescue a chipmunk stuck in tar sands the molasseslike substance also known as oil sands is a mix of bitumen oil sand clay and water the film crew documented numerous animals that succumbed to the gooey sludge leftover from the failed mine were at the infancy stage of what the potential is in the state said tim wagner a utah organizer with the sierra club if they get a hold there and get investors and make this process economically viable its katy bar the door but cameron todd us oil sands chief executive officer expressed his confidence that as people learn more about the pr springs operation they will become less fearful for one thing he said utah tar sands contain 90 percent less sulfur than albertan sands and overall carry a smaller greenhouse gas footprint todd also emphasized the benefits for the state including revenue for public education and nearly 100 jobs during construction and roughly the same number on a permanent basis for the first mine there will probably be expansions he said the current expectation is that we will be there for a long time much of the opposition to the project stems from the fact that the west already faces critical environmental challenges that are worsening with climate change of particular concern is the parched colorado river and its tributaries which supply irrigation and drinking water to nearly 40 million americans the pr springs site perches above the colorado river watershed noted john weisheit of the environmental advocacy group living rivers the colorado doesnt have anything to give the reservoirs are half full if it drops another 24 percent hydroelectricity will no longer be available said weisheit noting that tar sands mining is extremely waterintensive i cant believe this is happening it is ludicrous weisheit suggested that the operation poses both water quantity and quality issues todd disagreed he noted that us oil sands would draw water from 2000 or more feet below the surface its so deep that it doesnt conflict with any other uses in the region he said and its well below recharge levels for the water table and rivers that argument would be in line with us clean water policy which assumes that water deep underground will never be used and can therefore be intentionally polluted yet as propublica reported in january theres precedent for that to change mexico city now has plans to draw drinking water from a mile deep to deal with its own water woes tests conducted at the pr springs site suggest there is no shallower groundwater to contaminate according to todd even if there were groundwater the process is benign and wouldnt have any negative impact he said the only chemical involved is biodegradable and nontoxic a solvent from citrus utah state regulators awarded the permit based in part on that assertion but william johnson a professor of geology and geophysics at the university of utah said he remains skeptical on multiple counts fact is the groundwater system isnt well studied there are springs in the area some are intermittent some are perennial he said us geological survey researchers confirmed that knowledge of the hydrology around pr springs simply doesnt yet exist and while a citrusbased solvent may be generally innocuous on its own johnson explained how it could unleash compounds naturally trapped in the tar sands and make the end product toxic should it contact water im not inherently against development of the tar sands added johnson but some basic tests werent done also little understood is the extent of uranium contamination in the area in the 1940s usgs identified deposits of the radioactive heavy metal at pr springs old mines mill tailings and decades of nuclear testing have riddled the entire west with uranium said dr brian moench president of utah physicians for a healthy environment im concerned with extreme fossil fuel extraction everywhere but in our backyard im particularly concerned he said there are multiple layers of health impacts especially for children kids were the focus of the campout at pr springs they learned about the regions ecology collected water samples and even held protest signs while chanting stop tar sands in front of a trailer occupied by a us oil sands worker back at a company test pit

prison', body='its a great time to break free from the tyranny of your mobile operating system but which one for seshu kiran it meant defecting to the popular android operating system from apples ios but mark beales went the other way its a little confusing but then again we live in confusing times before we get to the reasons that kiran and beales bailed on their platforms lets pause for a minute to look at the mobile os landscape by mobile os i mean the software that runs on your mobile phone or tablet apples ios held a 33 percent market share for last year while googles android operating system claimed a commanding 59 percent share according to net market share the year before it was more competitive 44 percent to apple and 46 percent to google related executive contacts for google and apple theres a reason for the retreat of ios as others have found out but to understand why lets get back to kiran an engineer from los angeles who dumped his iphone for an android phone recently kiran once a loyal iphone user says he felt continuous pressure to upgrade to the latest device he became more uncomfortable with it as time went on leading up to the latest iphone which removed the headphone jack i heard someone in europe was using a washing machine for 35 years without any trouble he says think of your favorite smartphone manufacturer venturing into home appliances it would be a disaster for customers and it is already happening in the name of smart slapped on to any simple device what led him to the breaking point an upgrade of his iphone that killed the device thats a common complaint and its something ive personally experienced one day your iphone photos are crisp and beautiful but then after what seems like a routine system upgrade theyre all blurry hmm maybe its time for a new phone the choice of android came as a natural resistance for apple demanding me to buy a new phone he says when was the last time a blender needed an unsolicited purchase in the pretext of a certain upgrade for beales a retired mortgage banker the move from android to ios was prompted by a must have feature facetime the popular video telephony application we saw how well facetime worked for our kids and friends as well as seeing the greatly improved camera capability so both my wife and i switched to apples iphone he says the convenience of being able to link up with our grandchildren using facetime can not be matched by any other service interestingly google is trying to match the facetime experience with a new app called duo you can call a facetime user too but his experience underscores the main reason users would want to discard their android phone ios for all its faults remains a slicker more intuitive interface leaving ios in principle leaving one mobile os for another is relatively easy the ios to android transfer is dead simple handled in three easy steps that primarily involve moving most of your data to the cloud the androidtoios switch is a little more complicated it involves seven steps that include uploading downloading and adding codes to your new phone but still not terribly difficult but in practice the switch can be more problematic i learned that myself when i switched systems recently like kiran id grown tired of apples highpressure upgrades and was unimpressed with the new crop of iphones removing the headphone jack from the iphone 7 was a step too far i knew the tiny wireless headsets called airpods wouldnt last 24 hours in my house i have cats that play with everything as an early adopter of gmail and google docs transferring my data wasnt a problem it was already in the cloud even though i upgraded from an iphone 6 to perhaps the best android phone on the market the new google pixel i had some difficulty adjusting to the new operating systems look and feel i was one of the apple enthusiasts who lined up for the the first iphone in 2007 this felt almost like a betrayal and yet i knew it was time to move on setting up the new phone was mostly easy with a few painful moments i lost nearly all the google voice functionality voice is googles cloudbased calling application when i decided to drop my old cell phone number in favor of my google voice number thats a migration quirk that will hopefully be fixed soon i also struggled to learn where everything was in android system settings phone options and apps are all handled slightly differently than on ios its a little bit like learning a new dialect of your mother tongue its the same but different although my android phone is now my primary phone i find myself turning to my old iphone to catch up on news or send a message i suspect ill never completely leave the apple fold i still use a macbook pro for my writing but it feels good to have more options and to have a little fluency in android also i wont feel compelled to buy the next iphone when its released later this year no sir no more 24month upgrade cycle for me i hope wherever you go there you are maybe buckaroo banzai the video game hero had it right when it comes to phone operating systems wherever you go there you are and im not alone david radin a former technology columnist for the pittsburgh postgazette who now runs a scheduling app company says his family is evenly split between ios and android when we upgrade we consider the switch he says and almost never decide to change in either direction thats because both operating systems are really about the same when it comes right down to it they each have their strengths and weaknesses but in the end it kind of all evens out in the end the choice about leaving or staying may depend on what you want from the mobile os for example radins daughter who also uses a pixel likes the seamless integration with google photos googles cloudbased storage when you take a picture with your android phone it can automatically upload the image to the cloud and store it there in full resolution thats

winning', body='as a child my favorite chore was handpumping water from the thirtyfoot well on our family homestead the pump was shiny black and the water icecold then my father was diagnosed with leukemia a cancer linked to chemicals used in oil and gas production its been nine years since i drank that water i am from an impacted community in east texas home to oil and gas industry on the southern route of the keystone xl kxl tar sands pipeline my involvement in the climate movement is motivated by the reality my community faces nacogdoches texas lies along the southern path of kxl and cannot escape tar sands from cushing oklahoma down to beaumont texas pipe is buried in the ground and scheduled to go online by the end of the year we are waiting for the shoe to drop for tar sands oil to flow through the pipe for the bend of welded metal to respond to the heat and corrosion of bitumen we are waiting for an event over which we have little control despite its potentially disastrous impact on our lives within this experience lies the insight i have to offer the climate movement my experience is limited by the fact i am a young white woman from an unconditionally supportive family incomplete as it is however my perspective is the best thing i can offer and so i ask that the climate movement stops talking about winning my community will not win on climate and this idea delegitimizes the extraction industry impacts we already face i have lived alongside the reality of petroleum extraction my whole life a pipeline runs down our driveway i have been woken in the middle of the night by fracking fumes that burned my eyes and nose and made me feel sick the construction of kxl south near my home has ignited new concerns about the health and safety of my family and community in communities like mine impacts run deep and come from all sides maya on her familys property i will never win on climate tanks containing benzene on my familys property display plastic signs warning against cancer and requiring the use of a respirator there are three active gas well sites within a twominute walk from my front door scanning the land i am from it is impossible to imagine a scenario where i have not been exposed to the same chemicals that may have caused or contributed to my fathers cancer last fall the direct action campaign tar sands blockade tsb brought national attention to my community folks in tsb put their lives and livelihoods on the line to stop construction and raise awareness i am glad they came to stand with my community but this also marked a loss national climate groups celebrated obamas decision to delay the northern segment of kxl intentionally overlooking that this supposed win was paired with an endorsement to fast track the southern arm of kxl connecting a preexisting tar sands pipeline that ended in oklahoma to refining communities and shipping ports in texas there was no delay for uspipe was being put in the ground in search of a win the people of kxl south were written off as a loss like cancer taking over the body the oil and gas industry is too entangled in the organs of my community for a simple winlose dichotomy the industry employs us pays for community festivals and improves our roads they also contaminate our water deny us access to our land and take away our sense of agency extraction industries have impacted our land bodies and minds in ways that cant be erased or won checking a thesaurus suggests further complications of a winning framework synonyms to win include come in first and conquer in communities with an intersecting history of oppression winning doesnt seem to be the most appropriate message utilizing ideas of coming in first and conquering among individuals living a legacy of racism classism and colonialism seems intrinsically problematic environmental justice leaders ask instead that we lift up impacted communities will our movement be one that conquers or lifts up obamas decision about the northern segment of kxl is important but whatever is decided the southern segment has already marked my home even if kxl north is denied i will not win neither will people living at the end of the pipeline in manchester or port arthur or the people in alberta kalamazoo arkansas or countless other impacted communities we will not win this doesnt mean we give up on the northern segment of kxl but it does mean that we broaden our focus to include those already facing extraction impacts it means that we pour our energy into stopping all tar sandsnot just kxl north it means we stop talking about winning the northern segment of kxl and we start talking about changing the access extraction industries have to our land and our bodies hope provides momentum and lifts up the individuals and ideas of a movement for me however the concept of winning doesnt offer hope but instead says my experience isnt real and kxl south doesnt matter working only towards a win would force me to abandon my home if we are to be an enduring and inclusive movement we must provide a hope that welcomes joy and acknowledges loss we must not ask impacted communities to abandon their homes for the cause there is loss and pipe buried from oklahoma to the gulf coast of texas and if we rally around a win my home will continue to be overlooked if we only engage in winnable struggles our movement will be shortsighted lacking compassion and leaving many behind instead lets dig in deep go back for the overlooked and be with those that will not win lets be a movement that looks complexity in the eye offering a place for both hope and loss to sit together at the table and work to be a movement built on lifting others up'}.

cambridge analytica steve bannon want culture war', body='cambridge analytica may technically no longer exist but revelations about its conduct before and during the 2016 election continue to raise concerns about how social media can be used to undermine fundamental democratic processes on wednesday cambridge analytica whistleblower christopher wylie testified before the senate judiciary committee the wideranging threehour exchange with the companys former research director did little to allay fears the panel also featured mark jamison a visiting scholar at the american enterprise institute and eitan hersh a professor at tufts university and an expert on voter behavior and election strategies here are some of the major points of discussion wylie testified that cambridge analytica actively worked to undermine voters of color and foster political disengagement a tactic that featured more and more heavily in conversations just before wylie left the firm in 2014 though he says he didnt personally oversee or participate in any of those programs according to wylie cambridge analyticas algorithms could very accurately predict race and then go a step further by serving differentiated messages within that group so instead of serving similar generic messages to a large group of black people for example cambridge analytica could isolate and target specific individuals within that group who displayed certain character traits when you pull a random sample of african americans theyre all different people he said understanding their internal characteristics is a very powerful thing you dont treat them just as a black person you treat them as individuals cambridge analytica likely made similar efforts to suppress the votes of other communities wylie said targeting anybody with characteristics that would lead them to vote for the democratic party robert mercer is a billionaire megadonor who supports conservative causes the mercer family initially backed sen ted cruz rtexas in the 2016 republican primary then shifted their support to donald trump in the general election in 2013 at the urging of steve bannon who would later serve as white house strategist in the trump administration mercer invested tens of millions of dollars in cambridge analytica to effectively create an american shell company for its british parent scl group sen dianne feinstein dcalif posited on wednesday that mercers move gave cambridge analytica the appearance of following us election law which prohibits foreign firms from working on us elections but wylie testified that cambridge analytica nevertheless featured numerous british staffers in violation of a 2014 memo from outside legal counsel warning it not to do so whats more mercers funding came on the condition that cambridge analytica work only with republicans sen richard blumenthal dconn wondered wednesday if the investments may have been a deliberate attempt to circumvent campaign finance laws whenever mercer invested money it was for research and development which ultimately was to the benefit of its clients various pacs and campaigns wylie told blumenthal he added that mercers funds allowed cambridge analytica to work on projects and charge clients substantially less money for the work that was being done than it would have actually cost had the clients been paying for it themselves after mercer put money in the only restriction was that we not work with democrats he said according to wednesdays testimony cambridge analyticas parent company scl group engaged yet another subsidiary named aggregate iq to bolster the brexit campaign per wylie the campaign groups vote leave beleave and veterans for britain all had contracts with the company separately wednesday the guardian reported that vote leave and beleave both used the same data sets to target facebook users indicating a higher level of coordination than previously realized wylie also says cambridge analytica enlisted the help of black cube an israeli private intelligence group to conduct espionage work in nigeria and cambridge analytica has numerous ties to russia in 2014 alexander nix cambridges ceo met with executives from lukoil russias second largest oil company to discuss the firms political work in nigeria and elsewhere the firm was also in contact with wikileaks founder julian assange though feinstein acknowledged wednesday that the extent of cambridge analyticas connection to wikileaks and other russian interests isnt clear wylie said cambridge analytica also engaged with contractors who had advanced prorussian messages in eastern europe at one point collecting data on how americans viewed the leadership style of russian president vladimir putin and what their thoughts were on issues relating to russian expansionism there was a lot of contact with russian companies that made it known this research was being done wylie said a lot of noise was being made to companies and individuals who were connected to the russian government probably though its not clear to what extent armed with enough data points from facebook wylie said cambridge analytica could target people remarkably well based on as few as 100 of a persons facebook likes he said you can get to the same level of accuracy predicting personality traits as your spouse hersh the tufts professor disputed the idea that predictive capacity translates to persuasive advertising pointing out that political campaigns have a long history of engaging in tactics that dont work particularly well every election brings exaggerated claims about the effects of the latest technologies hersh said noting its in the interest of campaign consultants like cambridge analytica to embellish their role in a candidates victory from everything ive publicly seen about the firm im skeptical its strategies were unusually effective sen john kennedy rla however called hershs argument rubbish saying advertising can absolutely have a lasting impact when done well i see kids walking around all the time saying dilly dilly kennedy said referring to a popular tag line from a recent series of beer commercials they didnt just dream that up wylie left cambridge analytica in 2014 and was therefore unable to answer specific questions about the firms work during the 2016 election instead he repeatedly referred the senators to bannon who helped launch cambridge analytica and was reportedly deeply involved in its early efforts to collect facebook data and use it to target and influence voters bannon served as trumps chief campaign strategist during the 2016 election then assumed a similar role in the white house until his ouster last summer per wylie bannon was in charge when cambridge analytica began touting its voter suppression tactics to candidates bannon was also behind crafting messages like drain the swamp that would ultimately become focal points of the trump campaign the company learned there were segments of the population that responded to messages like drain the swamp or images of walls or indeed paranoia about the deep state that werent necessarily reflected in mainstream polling or mainstream political discourse wylie said adding that bannon saw cultural warfare as the means to create enduring change in american politics amid much uncertainty about cambridge analytica and just how much influence it wielded in 2016 most of the experts wednesday agreed on one thing social media is bad for democracy were seeing a resegregation of society thats catalyzed by algorithms wylie said sites like facebook reward informational echo chambers where partisan views are reinforced instead of challenged instead of a common fabric he said were tearing that fabric apart the further people drift from the mainstream the more theyre susceptible to absurd conspiracy theories and increasingly vitriolic messaging hersh agreed we have a basic human response that we are attracted to provocation and extremism he said and online platforms are encouraging that behavior we arent drawn to things that are truthful were drawn to what we want soon after cambridge analytica declared bankruptcy earlier this month its parent company scl group opened emerdata a strikingly similar firm overseen by several former cambridge analytica executives'}.

korea and the united states speaking at a news conference on friday models in china feature a different battery and are not being recalled by samsung the worlds biggest smartphone vendor the recall comes just over two weeks after the company launched its latest premium phone which features an outsized screen and highresolution camera it follows reports of the 988900 won 885 phone igniting while charging koh who declined to comment on how many phones needed to be replaced said samsung had sold 25 million of the premium devices so far the manufacturer plans to replace not only phones with faulty batteries sold to consumers but also retailer inventories and units in transit nomura estimated that more than 1 million units have been sold to end consumers i cant comment on exactly how much the cost will be but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number koh said the scale of the recall is unprecedented for samsung which prides itself on its manufacturing prowess while recalls in the smartphone industry do happen including for rival apple inc the nature of the problem for the galaxy note 7 is a serious blow to samsungs reputation analysts said the company should act quickly to minimize damage to its smartphone recovery after a string of product successes had reversed a fall in market share they added the phone first launched in 10 markets in north america asia and the middle east further rollouts have occurred since in markets like china where sales started just this week its wider availability set for coming weeks is now on hold while there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or otherwise burning users documented cases that lead to widespread product recalls remain relatively rare samsung said it was aware of 35 reports of affected note 7 batteries in 2007 the largest battery recall in consumer electronics history took place when nokia then the worlds top mobile handset maker offered to replace 46 million phone batteries produced for it by japanese maker matsushita battery germanys biggest operator deutsche telekom said it had stopped delivering orders for the galaxy note 7 while french operator orange said on its website that it had stopped presales of the phone and postponed its planned sales launch scheduled for friday in britain mobile carriers ee and vodafone continue to accept preorders for the note 7 on their sites a vodafone spokesman said its planned sept 19 sales launch could now slip but the company was waiting for more details from samsung to decide us operators have been taking preorders since early august all major wireless carriers including no 1 us wireless provider verizon communications inc said they had stopped selling the galaxy note 7 target a major us retailer also said it had halted sales of the note 7 verizon said that if a customer wants to return or exchange the galaxy note 7 it would waive through sept 30 the restocking fee it charges customers tmobile us majority owned by deutsche telekom said in a statement it would also waive restocking and shipping charges to customers who want to return the recalled phone samsung has said it aimed for the note 7 to maintain strong sales momentum in the second half of the year against stiffening competition from the likes of apple which is widely expected to release its latest iphone next week i am concerned more about a potential reduction in sales than recall costs said analyst jay yoo at korea investment securities the recall is likely to be a blow to earnings samsung said new sales of the note 7 in affected markets would resume after it deals with replacements a process it expects will begin in about two weeks the firm would extend refund periods for affected customers and offer exchanges for other samsung phones koh said investors sold samsung shares after the delay announcement on thursday stripping about 7 billion from the firms market value which remains just off recent record highs sentiment recovered somewhat in trading on friday as the shares rose 06 percent compared with 03 percent in the broader market credit suisse said a recall or major shipment delays could wipe 15 trillion won 134 billion from samsungs 2016 operating profit estimate of 302 trillion won in an absolute worst case scenario but the brokerage said that scenario was unlikely as it expected samsung to resolve the problem before the fourth quarter hi securities analyst james song said the replacement costs may be somewhat limited as samsung could recycle components of the recalled phones it is clever for samsung to

so does speaking up about it', body='why do people leave organizations reasons often include dealing with bad management finding a higher paid role elsewhere or not seeing opportunities for promotion and growth workplace sexual harassment is rarely treated as an issue of retention but it affects morale and career satisfaction at least as drastically as an issue like a difficult boss sexual harassment is one of the many ways workplaces are a hostile environment for women pushing them out of organizations and sometimes entire industries and sexual harassment clearly reflects the power structures that define our society it exacts a high cost on all individuals and communities but the price is disproportionately shouldered by women who can least afford it women of color and other marginalized women are among those hit hardest by a culture that for generations has turned a blind eye to the epidemic workplace sexual harassment comes with a steep cost the cost of participation a 2008 study by the american psychological association found a correlation between work withdrawal and the aftermath of sexual harassment for black women and in a 2016 survey of the chicago leisure and hospitality industry where the majority of women are of color 49 percent of housekeepers said a guest had answered the door naked or exposed themselves the most damning result of those housekeepers 56 percent said they did not feel safe returning to work after the incident the system was failing these women formal report numbers were low partly because the workers didnt believe it would make a difference to tell their stories in fact 43 percent of respondents said they knew someone who had reported harassment and seen nothing change unfortunately their fears are wellfounded twothird of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some sort of retaliation according to a 2003 study cited by the us equal employment opportunity commission and although times are changing they might not be changing for women in certain workplaces just yet the outpouring of recent allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent consequences for some perpetrators have prompted many to say were in the middle of a turning point in how sexual harassment is dealt with this is true for some women but not for all when allegations against harvey weinstein and other powerful men turned hollywood upside down jane fonda pointed out the obvious the women speaking out were being listened to because they were famous and white fatima goss graves the ceo of the national womens law center agreed saying class and race and stature play into whether someone is believed ironically the metoo movement was started a decade ago by black social activist tarana burke it took alyssa milano a white actress using the hashtag for it to go viral among other white women at least weve seen this before such as in the racism of the suffragettes femens attempts to liberate muslim women despite protests and the exclusive nature of the womens march when marginalized women particularly women of color need solidarity their white sisters dont often show up we have seen this play out in the cases of black actresses like lupita nyongo and aurora perrineau the implication is clear yes women who allege sexual harassment and other forms of abuse are to be believed if theyre the right kind of woman the majority of women dont fit that criteria and those who live and work at the intersections of marginalization whether due to race religion or disability are often hardest hit by harassment unfortunately theyre also the least supported the eventual outcome is dismal for women who are not famous wealthy or otherwise influential socioeconomic cultural and historical disadvantages compound to make it more likely that harassment will occur and less likely that it will be taken seriously the history of sexual exploitation through slavery has created a culture where black women are more likely to be sexually harassed but less likely to be perceived as victims they are therefore less likely to report and the cycle continues socioeconomic status exacerbates this vulnerability the majority 58 percent as of 2013 of lowincome families in the us are a racial or ethnic minority lowincome women of color often lack bargaining power face language and financial barriers to accessing legal services and in some cases are not even aware of their rights undocumented workers also face unique additional challenges as fears of retaliation or deportation may deter them from taking legal action it is imperative to acknowledge that efforts to improve the lot of one group of women may only tangentially affect women in other groups if we are truly interested in building a world where all women feel safe supported and able to fully participate in their communities and workplaces we must remember a rising tide does not lift every womans boat we need to be proactive in our advocacy for lowwage women and women of color we must ensure vulnerable women are provided adequate training in the language they are most comfortable in so they understand their rights the more educated a workplace is the less likely potential perpetrators will be to think they can get away with harassment we need to find ways to support these women legally financially emotionally when action is taken the metoo moment will be incomplete if it serves only the white wealthy and otherwise privileged among us look around in your own workplace and make sure no woman is being overlooked failing to do so will not only affect the women as individuals but will ultimately damage our workplaces our communities and our societies we will all be poorer for it'}.

with republican commissioners on at least one major vote earning the ire of outgoing democratic commissioner kara stein who schumer will have ultimate say in replacing later this year the gruenberg pick signals that democrats have decided to postpone the real fight over the fdic board for another day gruenberg has assembled a solid but unremarkable record running the fdic since 2011 largely

most of whom were coaches and allowed a culture of abuse where it was accepted for older coaches to have sexual relationships with underage athletes the article centers on chuck wielgus the former usa swimming executive director who died in april of complications from colon cancer usa swimming repeatedly missed opportunities to overhaul a culture within american swimming where the sexual abuse of underage swimmers by their coaches and others in positions of power within the sport was commonplace and even accepted by top officials and coaches according to the documents and interviews with

psychologist', body='how do the highest achievers think differently consider the professional athletes who have won multiple championships the tom bradys and kobe bryants of the world theyve mastered their craft but their mindsets also set them apart from their peers what do they do differently to reach peak performance dr stan beecham is a sports psychologist and director and found member of the leadership resource center in atlanta georgia hes the author of elite minds how winners think differently to create a competitive edge and maximize success dr beecham has worked with the best of the best from all over the world and has discovered some fascinating insights regarding ultrasuccessful people i recently interviewed dr beecham to learn from those insights the transcript below has been edited lightly for space and clarity kevin kruse you say that the primary determinant of success isnt talent or experience its mindset stan beecham division one athletes are basically the top 1 of high school athletes you could argue that professional athletes are another top five to 1 of those when you get at that level say for example in professional football the reality is everyone is talented ive had the chance now for the last 25 years of working with these populations where everyone is talented it becomes an issue of who are the kids that really fully maximize their talent what are the things that get in the way that keep them from realizing their talent do you really love this sport but not only do you love this sport do you love to practice do you love to go to the gym if youve got two kids with equal talent and one kid loves to practice then his whole experience of practice is going to be different because hes doing something he wants to do at the same time you might also find kids who are okay with themselves theyre not trying to win someones approval or show that theyre good enough theyre just playing the sport out of the joy of it these kids have a huge competitive advantage we know that human beings are at their best when theyre in the zone when were not concerned about ourselves in fact we dont even think people whove dabbled in sports psychology they say well the kid whos the better performer they think differently the reality is not that they think differently its that they dont think its the absence of thought its the absence of cognition its the absence of emotion that really is the advantage kruse its as if the unconscious mind moves so fast that it triggers faster than our conscious thinking so we have to actually impact the unconscious beecham lets break it down we know that its the mental game that counts whether its sports or business because the mind is controlling the body you have to think of the brain as the computer system and you have to think of your belief system as your software so you could be gifted and you could be in great shape but if the way that your mind is functioning is counter to that youll never realize that physical potential the starting place is to become conscious of your own thought process most of us we go through the day and were thinking all day long thats what the mind does it thinks and youre either aware of the thought or youre not but youre thinking all the time for example for an athlete going into a competition if my belief about myself is im not as good as other people and im not as good as these other guys i carry that with me all the time this sense of not being good enough or not being adequate then you can see that there are certain thoughts that im going to have which is i need to play really well to do well and so that belief system of what you hold as true is going to lead to a certain way of thinking which is going to lead to a certain way of acting if you think of people who consistently win you would say well they win all the time because they want to win right they want it bad enough the reality is thats not true at all its that people that win and succeed at a high level they dont actually think about winning they simply believe theyre going to do well in other words if i know im going to win the game then why would i even think about winning the game if theres some uncertainty as to how im going to do am i going to win or not i will spend a lot of time thinking about that kruse in terms of these unconscious beliefs in a work setting i unconsciously might think i dont have a shot at a promotion and that could affect my performance in the interview beecham yeah what i would say to that person is number one dont do your job with the intention of getting promoted or recognized just do your job to the best of your ability in other words if i start my career with the belief that im going to have a successful career and im going to get a lot of opportunities and when i get an opportunity i know im going to nail it then when i go to work what im thinking about is doing my job to the best of my ability i think the kid who goes to work every day and theyre trying to win someones approval so that they can get a promotion or a raise people sense that you know that guy the best way to get a raise the best way to get recognized is to not worry about it just do your job really well the other people that are competent around you theyre going to see that youre competent and theyre going to offer you opportunities kruse but what if im a pitcher who really thinks were going to win the game and im going to get nine strikeouts but theres that great hot batter thats been batting 450 lately or im that sales professional i can say that im going to win this deal but in the back of my mind i know were up against the tough competitor and budgets are tight what do we do to massage that unconscious or to really anchor that belief system beecham heres the reality of human beings were dynamic and were always changing lets go back to the salesperson one monday every time i call on someone i thought i was going to get a yes and get their business but i made six sales calls on monday and everybody said no now its tuesday and all of a sudden im not feeling so confident you see this in sport too where athletes go from having a lot of confidence to not its true for all of us its true for the best the question is how do i get back to it it really goes back to looking at the bigger picture and reminding myself that i had a bad day because everybody has a bad day one of the things thats a problem with our heroworship society is we think of these people who are these great folks as successful people we dont think that they struggle and experience failure the way that we do but the fact of the matter is they do in other words most peoples definition of success is the avoidance of failure people who are really successful will tell you their definition of success is their response to failure and they would actually argue that you have to have failure in other words theres no such thing of success without failure kruse you say we need to stop trying to get better all the time what do you mean beecham we all live in a culture and society thats obsessed with better right weve been taught since day one that in order to be successful you have to always want to get better and at the moment you quit trying to get better then the competition is going to pass you up i believed that for most of my career what ive just learned in the last five years is i really sat with this obsession with better and really said what is this about like what is this born out of what i realized is that the reason that we most of us want to be better is because we fundamentally believe that were not good enough yet the problem with better is better is about the future you cant get better now but performance everything that you do you do in the now you do in the present moment whatever the situation that youre in even if its not an ideal situation you could still make the best of it if you consistently do your best whats going to happen to over time you get better you grow and develop by consistently doing your best what i want people to understand is is no matter what you think about yourself you are good enough to do your best right now no matter how hard you try you cant be better than what you are i know at first it looks like a play on wordsbut what we have to understand is is this culture thats obsessed with better is also an anxious culture 25 of american population has a diagnosable mental disorder and 80 of that or 20 of us have an anxiety disorder and anxiety is about the future when the mind goes to the future you quit performing at your best so what we know about when human beings are at their best they dont go forward in the future they dont go backwards in the past they stay present and the mind gets really quiet and you function optimally the problem that i have with better is it keeps pulling you to the future if youre a leader just go to people and say look all im asking you to do is do the best that you can if youre a leader of an organization whether itd be sport or business what i would say is if you could get the people on your team to perform at their best then youre doing your job at a high level'}.

the workplace the report called on the companys board of directors to evaluate the extent to which some of the responsibilities that mr kalanick has historically possessed should be shared or given outright to other members of senior management kalanick said in his email that his leadership team would be running the company while he is gone he has limited his public comments since his mother was killed and his father injured in a boating accident in may tuesdays report makes sweeping recommendations to improve ubers internal structure from calling for more accountability for senior leaders to suggesting the company rewrite its policy to prohibit romantic relationships between managers and their reports ubers board of directors unanimously accepted the reports recommendations at a sunday meeting implementing them will ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated an uber spokeswoman said in a statement the board had also discussed a leadership shakeup including a leave of absence for kalanick amid a period of intense turbulence for the ridehailing company and a time of personal tragedy for the embattled executive kalanick founded uber in 2009 as a scrappy startup that eventually grew into a taxikilling behemoth valued at nearly 70 billion but the 40yearold has also faced torrents of criticism over ubers toxic workplace environment and his personal behavior in february former uber engineer susan fowler wrote a tellall blog post about the companys sexist culture that went viral fowler described being solicited for sex by a male manager discriminated against by management and stonewalled by human resources for reporting the conduct of male employees there in response to the allegations kalanick tapped holder to lead an investigation into ubers practices

within the company uber president jeff jones abruptly quit after just six months on the job in march saying his beliefs and approach to leadership were apparently incompatible with ubers in june

in no action 31 required employees to receive additional training seven prompted written warnings and 57 remained under review culture changes have been well underway at the company for months now an

charge earlier this year kalanick was widely criticized after he was caught on tape berating an uber driver the video shows kalanick discussing the companys fare structure with uber black car driver fawzi kamel at the end of a ride kamel who purchased a nicer car to drive for the upscale black service tells kalanick he lost 97000 because of you im bankrupt because of you in response kalanick fires back you know what some people dont like to take responsibility for their own shit they blame everything in their life on somebody else good luck kalanick adds sarcastically before slamming the door kalanick acknowledged that he needed help in an apology he wrote to employees after the video surfaced its clear this video is a reflection of me and the criticism weve received is a stark reminder that i must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up he wrote this is the first time ive been willing to admit that i need leadership help and i intend to get it uber has also struggled with issues beyond its corporate culture in january uber faced backlash for appearing to break a new york city taxi picket line formed in solidarity with protests over president donald trumps travel ban the hashtag deleteuber went viral and more than 200000 people deleted the uber app from their phones the protest was only quelled once kalanick announced hed resign from trumps economic advisory

team for the last eight years my life has always been about uber recent events have brought home for me that people are more important than work and that i need to take some time off of the daytoday to grieve my mother whom i buried on friday to reflect to work on myself and to focus on building out a worldclass leadership team the ultimate responsibility for where weve gotten and how weve gotten here rests on my shoulders there is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve for uber 20 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team but if we are going to work on uber 20 i also need to work on travis 20 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve during this interim period the leadership team my directs will be running the company i will be available as needed for the most strategic decisions but i will be empowering them to be bold and decisive in order to move the company forward swiftly its hard to put a timeline on this it may be shorter or longer than we might expect tragically losing a loved one has been difficult for me and i need to properly say my goodbyes the incredible outpouring of heartfelt notes and condolences from all of you have kept me strong but almost universally they have ended with how can i help my answer is simple do your lifes work in service to our mission that gives me time with family put people first that is my moms legacy and make uber 20 real so that the world can see the inspired work all of you do and the inspiring people that make uber

abeles ecole des hautes etudes en sciences sociales ehess anthropologist marc abeles latest research focused on luxury markets and arts across the globe a topic he touched on at length with lea barreau tran from sciences po bordeaux during an interview published here as part of our ongoing series globalisation under pressure lea barreaux its rather unusual to associate luxury with globalisation because they seem so alien to one another luxury is often considered as an illegitimate subject in anthropology you marc abeles have taken a different approach in establishing a global anthropology of luxury can you tell us more marc abeles luxury is a universal phenomenon it is just as present in our society as it is in societies far removed from ours in both space and time it appears in various forms depending on the groups specific history and culture bronislaw malinowski one of the pioneer scholars of anthropology focused on the circulation kulatrading system of precious goods ceremonial necklaces and bracelets in the trobriand islands which he compared to the jewels of great european families in his ethnographic research malinowski chiefly sought to uncover the significance of these objects and the symbolic and political connotations that determined the manner in which they were circulated well known to anthropologists the potlatch a giftgiving system among native americans illustrates this phenomenon too its lavish spending competition to impress and consumption of wealth has been extensively studied namely by american anthropologist franz boas i also want to examine the political symbolic and economic issues inherent in all forms of exchange through the prism of the circulation of luxury goods i am simply doing it in a very different context than that of traditional anthropology these days luxury commerce is carried out on a global scale and represents a significant portion of the worlds economy at the end of the 20th century the luxury industry along with other sectors of the economy underwent a dual process of concentration of ownership and financialisation it is one of frances few growing sectors and it makes up the bulk of our exports along with the arms and aeronautic industries in light of this i cant see why luxury should be treated as an illegitimate subject also we should ask ourselves why there is such a need to ascribe legitimacy in the field of social sciences did you know that pierre bourdieu the sociologist best known for the weight of the world kicked off his academic journal actes de la recherche en sciences sociales with an extensive article on fashion lea barreaux youve been studying the anthropology of globalisation for a long time these days your focus is on china a country with a huge appetite for luxury goods and one of the worlds leaders in counterfeit products has chinas influence revolutionised the very nature and definition of luxury in the globalised world what does it say about our own idea of authenticity marc abeles actually rather than trying to eradicate the counterfeit market entirely which would be quite simply impossible china has made real efforts toward limiting the worst excesses of counterfeiting for example in 2006 the chinese government closed one of its counterfeit industrys major outlets the xiangyang road market in shanghai that being said one of the characteristics of luxury is to give rise to imitation as a kind of counterpoint this dialogue between fake and authentic contributes to the value placed on luxury products lea barreaux the globalisation of luxury goods is also felt in the field of contemporary art on the one hand it has given artists greater freedom of movement across national borders and a wider audience on the other it has increased speculation in the art market as an anthropologist how have you seen these trends manifest marc abeles there is a great deal of overlap between luxury commerce and the contemporary art market most businesses in the luxury sector involve artists in their creation process they create foundations to promote contemporary art and in some cases also run auction houses luxury has become a global industry it is under constant threat of homogenisation and trivialisation companies essentially want to project an image of extraordinary refinement by associating what is currently most priced in contemporary art with their brand looking at the art basel miami beach contemporary art fair it was clear to me that this event is not solely designed for collectors it also provides a platform for businesses in the luxury sector to promote their products looking at these kinds of events from within isnt enough we need to understand their impact on the city and the way they create connections between the rich and privileged and a general public that is hungry for cultural symbols lea barreaux establishing a global anthropology of luxury brings up a range of political issues and reveals the transformations that modernday capitalism has undergone how do you hope to contribute to these discussions without making prescriptive judgements about the positive and negative aspects of globalisation marc abeles we cannot distinguish the trends affecting the industry and commerce of luxury from broader changes within capitalism anthropology provides a multifaceted point of view by approaching luxury as a total social artefact as for prescriptive judgements luxury is often associated with wealth which can lead to it being condemned as evidenced by the amount of moralising literature that has been published on the subject since ancient times i think we should remember instead that in 1871 members of the paris commune published a manifesto in which they celebrated luxury and made it their aim to bring it to the people after all the right to luxury could constitute a legitimate claim luxury is neither an illegitimate subject for social science nor one that is

trump era but at a surprising cost', body='by tim henderson baltimore one recent early morning as the sun rose a young mother knocked at the sacred heart parish rectory door in a cramped study she told the church pastor the rev bruce lewandowski what had happened feeling ill she had come home early from her overnight job cleaning offices and found a relative sexually abusing her handicapped daughter she had gathered up the child and her other children and brought them to the church why didnt you call 911 you have to call 911 the pastor told her the woman he recalled later broke down if i tell the police theyll arrest me too she said as an unauthorized immigrant she was terrified of talking to the police despite a city policy that bars officers from asking anybody about their immigration status a year and a half of struggle between the trump administration and immigrantfriendly states and cities has led to a stalemate socalled sanctuary cities and states are reducing deportations but raids aimed at stirring fears are having their intended effect according to a new yearlong study by the nonpartisan migration policy institute federal immigration officials told the authors of the report that in places where local law enforcement wont help them deport immigrants who have landed in jail their alternative is to look for such people on neighborhood streets stymied by local resistance the trump administration may never get deportations back to the recent high of 200000 in 2010 under president barack obama but highly publicized raids in sanctuary cities are taking a toll on immigrants peace of mind theyre sending a message and the message is being received said randy capps director of research for the migration policy institute a think tank based in washington dc when we were on the street in chicago he said of the sanctuary city we heard the same expressions of anxiety as we did in places like houston and suburban atlanta the fully cooperative jurisdictions that fear and anxiety has caused unauthorized immigrants to retreat from public life in many cities immigrantfriendly or not immigrants already are more reluctant to report crimes and to use health services and other benefits the report concluded in many cities crime reports by hispanics fell after the start of the trump administration especially for sexual assault and abuse cases even as reports by nonhispanic people rose the migration policy institute report underscores the unevenness of immigration enforcement the us department of justice has threatened legal action against many cities that dont cooperate with ice and texas has curbed sanctuary policies in travis county home to austin at the same time california is facing pushback from san diego and orange counties as it implements a statewide sanctuary policy chicago and other immigrantrich sanctuary cities along with california have been able to control deportations over minor crimes by refusing ice access to local jails through socalled detainers seeking to take custody for possible deportation in cities that are cooperating with federal immigration authorities even a traffic arrest can expose an immigrant to deportation especially if a court has ordered deportation or the individual has returned after a previous deportation about 1 in 10 unauthorized immigrants is in this situation where theyve already exhausted their rights under the legal system said immigration attorney simon sandovalmoshenberg of the legal aid justice center in falls church virginia theyll be deported basically as soon as ice can arrange a flight local raids can help federal authorities recover some of the potential prisoners lost to sanctuary policies but not many the study found six percent of prisoners freed because jails declined an ice request or detainer are later arrested by ice thats frustrating to the immigration officials the migration policy institute interviewed for its study to the extent jurisdictions do not cooperate ice officers told mpi their agency has little choice but to carry out enforcement activities in neighborhoods and other community locations even though it is not as efficient a use of their time or resources nor does such enforcement yield the numbers that can be identified by screening cases in local jails such raids also result in the arrests of bystanders called collateral arrests if officers come across other unauthorized immigrants while looking for those targeted for crimes or immigrationrelated offenses more than twothirds of the 650 arrested in one major operation were collateral arrests of people who were not targeted many simply bystanders according to the mpi study such arrests can spread fear but dont necessarily mean immediate deportation an unauthorized immigrant without a deportation order is entitled to a court hearing they may wait years to get one because court dockets are so full said sandovalmoshenberg who represents a dozen people arrested as bystanders during raids last year in virginia they stop you and say have you heard of soandso you say no and then they say what about you do you have papers sandovalmoshenberg said none of his clients have been deported he said and some wont even face court hearings until after the 2020 election such raids and the actions of enforcementfriendly states and cities have increased arrests and deportations in the short term deportations overall remain low compared with the early years of the obama administration arrests and deportations by ice remain about half what they were in 2010 and 2011 when there were about 300000 immigration arrests and 200000 deportations a year without local officials feeding arrestees to ice through detainers and other methods of cooperation the trump administration does not have the manpower to get those numbers back up to obamaera levels california home to a fifth of the nations estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants reduced cooperation to a new low last year by banning any communication with ice about suspects charged with minor crimes the great variation in how states and localities cooperate with ice the study says means that the fortunes of an unauthorized immigrant in texas tennessee and georgia where the mere act of driving can result in arrest and deportation are entirely different than in california chicago and new york where immigrants can be arrested for a variety of crimes and still not be taken into ice custody if stress is unpredictable even in sanctuary cities the same is true for strictenforcement areas such as prince william county virginia a suburb of washington dc the county gives full cooperation to ice and detainer requests were up 16 percent between 2016 and 2017 but they are still down by a third from 2013 according to the migration policy institute dimas navarro a middleaged heating and airconditioning worker from el salvador who lives in prince william county with legal work permission said crackdowns come and go in the immigrant community in the past navarro said hostility drove central americans to neighboring maryland where they were more welcome but today navarro thinks theyre starting to return to virginia driven by plentiful work in construction theres good times and bad times it depends on whos in power navarro said on a recent day they were stopping everybody checking papers for illegal immigrants now no now everything is ok you never know when its going to change though navarro said he was only stopped by police twice while driving once for not coming to a full stop at a stop sign but had no trouble since he has a drivers license the mpi report found that suburban police were more likely to use traffic enforcement to target immigrants gwinnett county in suburban atlanta for example held as many as 184 immigrants for ice in a month last year most had been arrested on traffic charges our clients are getting arrested for things they should not be or that white people would not be arrested for said lisa johnsonfirth an immigration attorney in manassas virginia jessica vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies a think tank that favors less immigration defended the ice practice of arresting people in the community during raids ices goal in making arrests is not to sow fear but to arrest and remove deportable

to uncover how moons of mars formed', body='elizabeth tasker japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa has announced a mission to visit the two moons of mars and return a rock sample to earth its a plan to uncover both the mystery of the moons creation and perhaps how life began in our solar system the solar systems planets take their names from ancient greek and roman mythology mars is the god of war while the red planets two moons are named for the deitys twin sons deimos meaning panic and phobos fear unlike our own moon phobos and deimos are tiny phobos has an average diameter of 222km while deimos measures an even smaller 13km neither moon is on a stable orbit with deimos slowly moving away from mars while phobos will hit the martian surface in around 20 million years the small size of the two satellites makes their gravity too weak to pull the moons in spheres instead the pair have the irregular lumpy structure of asteroids this has led to a major question about their formation were these moons formed from mars or are they actually captured asteroids our own moon is thought to have formed when a marssized object hit the early earth material from the collision was flung into the earths orbit to coalesce into our moon a similar event could have produced phobos and deimos the terrestrial planets were subjected to a rain of impacts during the final throes of solar system formation mars shows possible evidence of one such major impact as the planets northern hemisphere is sunk an average of 55km lower than the southern terrain debris from this or other impacts could have given birth to the moons alternatively phobos and deimos could be asteroids that were scattered inwards from the asteroid belt by the looming gravitational influence of jupiter snagged by marss gravity the planet could have stolen its two moons this mechanism is how neptune acquired its moon triton which is thought to have once been a kuiper belt object like pluto there are compelling arguments for both the teamimpact and teamcapture scenario the orbits of the two moons are circular and in the plane of marss own rotation while the chance of this happening during a capture event are extremely low observations of the moons suggest they may have a composition similar to that of other asteroids definite determination of the moons composition would act as a fingerprint to distinguish the two models a collision event should result in moons made from the same rock as mars but if the moons were captured they would have formed in a different part of the solar system with distinct minerals this is where the new mission comes in jaxas martian moon exploration mission mmx is due to launch in september 2024 and arrive at mars in august 2025 the spacecraft will then spend the next three years exploring the two moons and the environment around the red planet during this time mmx will drop to the surface of phobos and collect a sample to return to earth in the summer of 2029 due to their weak gravity collecting a sample from small rocky bodies is a difficult challenge but this is jaxas speciality the space agency has previously returned samples from asteroid itokawa in 2010 the sequel to that mission hayabusa2 is due to arrive at asteroid ryugu next year the excitement for a mars moon mission has led to strong international involvement in mmx on april 10 jaxa president naoki okumura met his counterpart from frances centre national detudes spatiales cnes jeanyves le gall the meeting cemented a collaboration between the two space agencies cnes will provide an instrument for mmx as well as combining expertise on flight dynamics for the tricky encounter with the martian moons the french instrument will combine a highresolution infrared camera and spectrometer a technique that analyses the composition of each image pixel this will allow the rocks of the martian moons to be investigated down to a few tenths of a metre with a pixel size an order of magnitude smaller than that of similar instruments on missions such as nasas mars reconnaissance orbiter and esas mars express the spectrometer will also be able to help mmx select the best landing site on phobos and take the sample cnes will also explore the possibility of building a rover to explore the surface of phobos a decision will be taken in november this year in addition to the collaboration with france mmx will carry an instrument from nasa while the cnes spectrometer will examine the type of minerals on the moons the nasa instrument will pick out individual chemical elements this is done by analyzing the highenergy gamma rays and neutrons that are produced during the bombardment of cosmic rays from the sun or more distant sources together these instruments will reveal a more thorough composition of marss mysterious satellites both teamcapture and teamimpact offer fantastic science moons formed from collisional debris would be preserved time capsules of conditions on the young mars in this early epoch mars and the earth are expected to have been far more similar than now a sample from this time could reveal how a planet becomes habitable but moons captured from the asteroid belt would be kin to the meteorites that rained down on the young earth these are thought to be the deliverers of our oceans and even our first organic molecules a sample from phobos would be a taste of the package that was flung around the early solar system phoboss ever decreasing distance to mars also means that the top layer of the moons soil should be littered with meteorites scattered from the planet such a short journey would allow much lowerdensity material to survive the trip unlike the martian meteorites that manage to reach earth this transferred material will also be from all over mars rather than the small patch that rovers have examined and it might result in a more complete picture of mars as well as of its moons mmx is an exciting mission bringing information about moon formation mars and water delivery around our sun as we wait for 2024 are you voting for teamimpact or teamcapture elizabeth tasker associate professor

regulation the ground is shifting under consumers heres what it means', body='if the recent news from washington isnt a little unsettling maybe you should look again a new administration has brought some unconventional thinking to the oval office and the repercussions could be felt for years by american consumers among the changes an executive order that whenever an executive department or agency publicly proposes a new regulation it will identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed the appointment of cabinet members and agency heads openly hostile to government regulation notably federal communications commission chairman ajit pai who rescinded a plan to regulate cable tv settop boxes heads of industry have been meeting with the new president and his cabinet members and the signs are alarming in one recent meeting with business leaders the president vowed were gonna be cutting regulation massively it doesnt matter how you voted in the last election or if you voted at all these actions are bound to affect you the question is where when and how the industries that are likely to deregulate faster where consumers will also notice are the healthcare and financial sectors says suryadipta roy and associate professor of economics at high point university the financial industry has already felt some of the deregulatory effects notably through an executive order that scaled back some of the financial reforms of the obama administration but its just the beginning the deregulation will likely relax financial oversight that is carried out under the doddfrank reform act says roy in the short run this kind of deregulation is likely to shore up share prices for banking stocks the potential downside to this piece of legislation is that it can lead to a repeat of the mistakes that aggravated the 2008 financial crisis another area of deregulation relaxing the fiduciary rule that requires financial professionals to put their clients interests first when giving advice on retirement investments roy says this might lead the asset managers toward excessive risktaking by driving uninformed clients toward highrisk assets without proper understanding of the risks those are hardly on only industries that will be affected say experts the energy sector faces massive deregulation and some see that as a good thing deregulation of the energy sector will help the country achieve complete independence from foreign sources of oil says prabir chetia who heads the business and research advisory department for aranca a research firm america will be able to tap the untapped energy 50 trillion in shale energy oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves that will lead to lower energy prices he predicts chetia also expects the food and drug administration to face significant deregulation which would bring in new ways to vet drugs before commercial rollout one idea is vetting new drugs through consumer reviews of medications he says but he adds it could easily backfire potentially exposing patients to ineffective and potentially dangerous drugs it could be catastrophic he says perhaps the biggest impact will be felt by customers of financial institutions as the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb is reformed or possibly eliminated as a reminder the cfpb is tasked with administering important federal statutes including the truth in lending act fair credit reporting act real estate settlement procedures act equal credit opportunity act home mortgage disclosure act and the electronic fund transfer act as well as new responsibilities for consumer financial protection its a difficult argument to lessen the strength of a governmental entity looking out for consumers says braden perry a litigation regulatory and government investigations attorney with kennyhertz perry a law firm in kansas city but it may happen perry predicts the underlying protections will either be redistributed to other agencies or the singledirector cfpb will be replaced with a commissionstyle agency with congressional oversight but the cfpb is facing a serious reshaping he says bottom line for consumers the age of laissez faire deregulation has begun during this time you wont be able to turn to the government for help youll have to be more vigilant than ever and youll have to expect the worst as a consumer if you tilt to the right politically all this talk of deregulation may make your day but the ramifications for consumers could be serious and the negatives will almost certainly outweigh the positives if the predictions are true if the regulations go out the window then ordinary consumers will lose an important ally with the power to create and maintain a fair competitive marketplace you dont have to be a political activist to shudder at the thought of credit cards with gotcha fees and confiscatory interest rates of financial advisers working to enrich themselves instead of helping their customers of drugs not properly vetted and of federal lands being drilled for oil you just have to be a concerned citizen christopher elliott specializes in solving

neonazi merch gets das boot', body='new york it started innocently enough with a flyer making the rounds at a death metal show in amityville late last month the heretics crypt the flyer reads in gothic script long islands most extreme brick mortar record store in over a decade specializing in underground metal and whatever else we feel like a death metal vinyl shop huddled in the corner of a cute antique store in patchogue for some of the metalheads in the area this was a talker the south shore of long island is not exactly blastbeat country but when two locals showed up to score some records last week they found that the underground metal on offer included a lot of neonazi records and the whatever else included white nationalist band tshirts we start leafing through everything and about a quarter of the way through the first box it became really apparent that the only thing they were selling was national socialist black metal nsbm said one of the two who asked that huffpost withhold their names for fear of harassment there were scatterings of bands that werent associated but the vast majority was the very sketchy nazirelated stuff it was disgusting each offending item they said was instantly recognizable as belonging to fringe neonazi bands or other groups not tolerated in polite metal circles in photos of the tshirts and records and in the owners social media profiles neonazi iconography abounds wolfs hooks black sunwheels the hammer and sword everything short of a swastika the pair immediately started digging online to figure out how this stuff found its way to patchogue they took their findings to the president of the greater patchogue chamber of commerce james skidmore he was incensed finding the popup and the small crew that put it together an affront not just to the metal community but to suffolk county in general which has some white supremacist baggage of its own our community has worked way too hard over the years to come to terms with what we are and who we are and to combat racism wherever it exists skidmore told huffpost so to me this was a slap in the dick excuse me for saying i was like are you kidding me within hours of finding out on april 23 skidmore said he arrived at the antique shop that heretics crypt called home to find a man packing his shit up and leaving they had been kicked out by the antique shops owner who said he didnt know what they were selling beyond band merchandise and records the weird little ode to white supremacy in patchogue had been snuffed out within a matter of days but now skidmore and his community faced some tough questions who brought this here and why is white supremacy showing its face publicly in long island again this is my major concern they show up they get the conversation going with music or whatever else and then out comes a kkk party or a white nationalist movement he said with the help of friends on facebook and the metal community at large locals found one of the men who set up the shop paul guhring a local musician whose previous flings with neonazis have landed him in heiwasser nyc antifa profiled him in 2016 after his label wolftyr productions brought various nsbm bands together for a show in ronkonkoma for what its worth the show was a flop he said guhring who spoke to huffpost on tuesday fell back on the usual specious excuses when asked about the neonazi symbolism on display at the popup and on his and his compatriots various social media pages those are all from the esoteric pagan ideologies he said they dont necessarily have to be about nazis im not a racist i have friends of all kinds people that know me in our circle of friends i dont have that many friends but in our circle of friends this is disputable it doesnt take a scholar in nazi death metal to parse the tshirts and records that guhrig was selling there were known nsbm bands like hate forest goatmoon grand belials key and heathen hammer whose promotional materials look as if they ripped off the nazi symbolism wikipedia page black sunwheels nods to nazi phrases like blood and soil and other wellknown neonazi imagery were on full display there was even a shirt in baby size featuring the band m8l8th below right and if theres any doubt as to the general ideology of the fan base for m8l8th and grand belials key look no further than the audiences at their live recordings on youtube nazi salutes are as prominent as fists in the air guhring acknowledged that some of the stuff in his collection was nazi smut but he denied being involved himself at least ideologically sure the people around him might be throwing up hitler salutes and his favorite artwork has represented nazism for decades and his former band grafvolluth very publicly identified as national socialist and his label promoted white supremacist groups like pennsylvanias wotanorden but dont get the wrong idea he said people can take it any way they like after all its a free country he said just because neonazis hijacked certain symbols for themselves and theyre going to keep doing it of course it does indeed have its old ancestral roots he lamented that he opened up shop in the first place he and another man who helped set up heretics crypt buddy zajac mayoka deleted their facebook pages after the outcry last week and now guhring said his label is offline and he has no plans for any shows or other commercial enterprises i really wish we didnt do it at all to tell you the truth all the anger ive caused people he said basically my reputation is ruined because of this everything is stashed away in boxes and hefty bags its done we cant keep up with this for skidmore the shop scared up memories of long islands history of extremism in the 1930s suffolk county was home to camp siegfried a pronazi summer camp adjacent to a german colony in yaphank that named its streets after hitler and goebbels after the war some of hitlers relatives lived on long island the ku klux klan has always been active there long island native chris cantwell a white nationalist nicknamed the crying nazi for a video in which he teared up at the thought of being arrested for his role in the charlottesville virginia mayhem thought the area receptive enough to his views that he considered running for new yorks 1st congressional district he failed to get enough signatures in his bid most recently skidmore recalled an ecuadorean immigrant was killed in 2008 in nearby riverhead where four teens admitted to being part of a gang that targeted hispanics for hate crimes weve worked hard to get away from that we want the message clear that hate is not welcome in patchogue skidmore said even just a small popup a little bit of cancer is still cancer'}.

not been shown the light of day while hollywood is making headlines sexual harassment both overt and subtle has taken place for years in corporate america on social media platforms hundreds of thousands of women are raising their hands and saying metoo former fox news anchor gretchen carlsons newly released book be fierce stop harassment and take your power back is shining a bright light on workplace sexual harassment and identifying the problem not as a womens issue but as a mans issue as well and one that will take the engagement of men to solve gender diversity experts are calling the national conversation ignited by the harvey weinstein scandal a watershed moment women do not go to work looking to be harassed they want to show up do valuable work and be treated with dignity and respect in a nonhostile workplace most companies and hr departments are illequipped to deal with these issues fewer than a onethird of cases of sexual harassment are ever reported and fewer than onethird of those are prosecuted while the approach of many men is still choosing secrecy and not wanting to get involved a small but critical mass of men are speaking up and asking what can i do in my work with ywomen i help companies advance women by engaging men in the conversation companies that are making the boldest steps to create a gender equitable workplace are often following these four steps listen learn lead and have the will to change these same strategies can be applied to ensure that your organization is in a place that does not tolerate sexual harassment progressive organizations today are seeking solutions on how to attract retain and advance women many men i believe up to 30 percent want to help the challenge is knowing what to do on a daily basis to demonstrate advocacy listen genuinely listening to employee issues and concerns is the requisite first step to gaining understanding before diving into leading to understand what is happening or not happening in your organization it is imperative that senior leaders typically men who comprise more than 85 percent of senior business leaders ask women about their experiences and really listen to their answers carlsons book reminds us of the stunningly low rate of reporting sexual harassment in particular according to the eeoc she writes 70 percent of women who experience sexual harassment at their jobs dont report it for fear it will cause negative repercussions both personally and professionally there are systemic issues in your company that are prohibiting growth retention and development of all employees impeding engagement and affecting your companys reputation in the marketplace you dont know unless you ask learn all leaders especially senior leaders must deepen their knowledge of workplace harassment do you know what legally qualifies as sexual harassment or a hostile work environment many leaders may not know that if they witness or are told of an incident of sexual harassment they have a responsibility to report it and failure to do so could mean repercussions for them leaders and managers need to know that their jobs could be in jeopardy if they choose to ignore a situation or not get involved leaders also need to be able to articulate the business case for advancing women leaders must understand how advancing women in their organization affects revenue company reputation and talent acquisition and retention they should also be learning about unconscious bias and discrimination against women in the workplace what it looks like to include and advance women and why it is critical to the future of their organization to do so lead leadership starts at the top of organizations with visible vocal leadership think about this you are only as good as your worst manager if you have just one managerleader committing sexual harassment you need to be prepared to be frontpage news uber is the perfect example i dont think travis kalanick went to bed knowing he would lose the company he founded as the result of a heinous behavior by a middle manager and in ubers case hr was also culpable in the coverup have the will sadly we know the men who tell offcolor jokes treat women as secondclass citizens and perpetrate sexual harassment too many men are willing to just ignore the situation its time for men to stand up having the will means speaking up and calling out other men if it personalizes this situation think about a simple fact picture that thought and now remember the number from above onethird of women in the workplace experience some type of harassment if this isnt enough for men to be outraged and choose to speak up then i dont know what it will take simply put it is time for all men to stand up speak out and support women in the workplace using hashtags such as metoo ihearyou iwillspeakup and howiwillchange men can begin to advocate for women in the workplace and ensure that all people can do valuable meaningful work in a safe environment in doing so they are pledging to treat women with respect and challenge other men when they dont its not only our obligation as leaders its our obligation as sons brothers fathers and

information on 123 million american households', body='youve probably never heard of them but chances are good they know plenty about you including things like your home address your phone number your sports interests and whether youre a dog enthusiast they are an online marketing and analytics firm by the name of alteryx and according to a report tuesday by the cyber risk company upguard they left a database containing sensitive information on 123 million american households unsecured and open to the public chris vickery upguards cyber risk research director told huffpost tuesday he stumbled across the 36gigabyte database during a routine search of amazon web services storage buckets which house data for various companies of all sizes anyone with a basic understanding of what keywords to look for and how to sift through vast amounts of data could have done the same vickery said im not the only person doing this he said im certain there are bad guys doing it as well as good guys as for the data itself the file contains 123 million rows of data one for just about every single household in the us at the time of its likely creation in 2013 and each of those households is individually described via 248 specific categories in addition to the data listed above address phone number whether youre a dog or cat person etc other categories include the number of children living in the house and their age ranges and gender what types of magazines you subscribe to your mortgage amount how old your car is which causes you donate to your ethnicity and plenty more while the database doesnt include individual names vickery said thats a moot point given everything else it contains it gets down to a level specific enough to be dangerous although it does not have first and last names he said its so simple to look up somebodys name if you have their address and their phone number given its personal nature that information could be used for pretty damaging purposes like circumventing whats known as knowledgebased authentication when you buy a car these days or you apply for a loan or youre going for a student loan with the government or something in order to verify who you are a lot of times you run into knowledgebased authentication vickery explained thats where not only do you have to provide your name address and social security number but theyll also ask you ok where did you live five years ago who owns the mortgage to your house all sorts of bits of data that only you are supposed to know databases like this allow bad guys to have that information about large swaths of people he said so lots of fraud can be committed even with systems that are designed to be based on personal knowledge a central component of alteryxs database titled consumerview was provided by a company you probably have heard of experian experian has a database with that exact name that alteryx incorporates into a license it sells for 38995 a year reached for comment experian directed huffpost to alteryx alteryx didnt immediately respond to a request for comment this is an alteryx issue experian said in a statement noting that the data in question is used often in marketing data security has always been and always will be our highest priority as a matter of security best practices experian vets all our clients and mandates robust security measures and controls to secure our data to be clear experian isnt responsible for this particular data breach though its certainly not a stranger to data breaches in general experian supplied the data to alteryx and alteryx failed to secure it similarly alteryx likely wasnt at fault for a separate data breach earlier this year that exposed the personal information of almost all of americas 200 million registered voters the database in that instance was stored as an alteryx file type suggesting it originated with the company but the blame rests with the republican data firm that left it open to the public regardless of who is at fault in this particular circumstance vickery said all the companies that compile this type of data need to up their security game im a little disappointed that alteryx would just leave it unencrypted out there for anybody and that experian would just give them a copy like that he said keeping it open and in the clear is just asking for trouble as for the consumers affected by this breach which again is pretty much every american household there isnt much we can do except push for stronger regulations on the companies that compile this type of data if youre an american your information probably was exposed vickery said we live in a new age he added you have to stay vigilant you have to watch your financial accounts you cant just assume youre not going to be a victim because the bad guys have the knowledge the information and the tools these days its more a question of whether or not youre lucky rather than how protective youve been he said even if youve been very protective of your information theres companies like equifax that have your data and even though you never gave it to them they get breached all the time'}.

scents were basic like pure frankincense and myrrh today theyre likely an undisclosed mixture of petrochemicals modern chemical fragrances are also incorporated into a long list of products from detergents and deodorants to dryer sheets and hair sprays the pervasiveness of synthetic scents according to experts threatens the health of many people whether they realize it or not while a small fraction of americans are hypersensitive to scents many may be subtly affected and at increased risk of future health problems from living in an invisible fog of chemicals fragrance is just one piece of the problem they say with chemical ingredients that can include carcinogens neurotoxins and hormone disruptors almost everything we use has chemical scent added said joseph heimlich an expert in environmental education and community involvement at the ohio state university what does clean smell like it doesnt heimlich added but weve been conditioned through media and society that it should smell like lemons or mountain fresh the fragrance industry asserts the benefits of scents whether natural manmade or designed to smell like nature these products contribute to our overall quality of life and wellbeing elena solovyov a spokeswoman for the international fragrance association an industry trade group told the huffington post consumers can be assured that the fragrance used in their favorite products is safe solovyov said noting that individual ingredients are evaluated for consumer and environmental safety and that products are tested according to all government and companyspecific requirements the fragrance industry sets its own standards and facilitates its own safety reviews with help from outside experts thats little comfort for people who find it unbearable to venture inside churches workplaces schools or even the grocery store there are people out there who would like to go to church but they cant said gina blum an elder at lake washington christian church who spent weeks compiling a list of products and their disclosed ingredients to help identify the safest alternatives for the church and its members blum said she is mildly sensitive to scents linda moreno another member with mild sensitivity said her daughter kelsey 22 cant even walk past someone wearing perfume on the street without getting sick moreno called kelseys hypersensitivity multiple chemical sensitivity a controversial condition the american medical association studied it in 1991 but found no scientific evidence that supports the contention that multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a significant cause of disease rj mills an ama spokesperson told huffpost until accurate reproducible and wellcontrolled studies are available mills said the ama believes that multiple chemical sensitivity should not be considered a recognized syndrome dr philip ranheim an environmental medicine doctor based in lake stevens wash who has dealt with chemical sensitivity issues himself said the controversy will likely continue theres not a lot of money and time and effort going into defining it more fully said ranheim who attends a church unable to address his condition other countries such as england and japan have had governmentassociated environmental centers for studying chemical sensitivity but theres bias against it in this country ranheim added i think were addicted to chemicals and some people dont want to admit theres a downside to it a review of research published in may concluded that one significant exposure or the accrual of repeated lowlevel exposures seems to overload and impair the bodys ability to tolerate chemicals at that point minute amounts of diverse everyday chemicals can trigger symptoms the larger the total body burden of toxins suggests the review the greater the degree of hypersensitivity studies in the early 2000s estimated that 12 percent to 16 percent of americans are hypersensitive to chemicals i think the numbers are increasing its becoming an epidemic said anne steinemann a coauthor on one of those studies and a visiting researcher at scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego her response when she first heard of lake washington christian churchs campaign to address chemical sensitivity hallelujah to some extent were all affected by chemicals steinemann added in fact those with acute symptoms such as migraine headaches asthma attacks heart palpitations or skin rashes after exposures may act as proverbial canaries in the coal mine when it comes to toxic chemicals and their subtle or future effects on others according to some experts interviewed by huffpost but avoiding chemical fragrances they added is made difficult by their pervasiveness and by scant regulation solovyov the fragrance industry spokeswoman confirmed there is no official definition for the industry terms unscented or fragrancefree the former can include fragrance ingredients that actually mask odors she also said fragrance formulas are protected as trade secrets ingredients are rarely disclosed even full disclosure of chemicals offers little information on their ultimate toxicity according to steinemann the solution is to use truly natural or simple products like our grandparents used vinegar baking soda hydrogen peroxide lemon juice from a real lemon she said people with fragrance sensitivities usually dont react to aromatic flowers fruits or other truly natural smells added steinemann its often claimed that fragrance chemicals such as limonene are natural but there is a difference between the limonene as found in an orange and limonene made in a lab janine ridings of bellevue wash became housebound after an extreme exposure to jet fuel fumes in 1998 a short while later she began an online prayer group aroma of christ to provide fellowship and encouragement for others dealing with multiple chemical sensitivity ridings said she has been fortunate that a couple local churches accommodated her needs with everything from fragrancefree windowed rooms outside the sanctuary to air freshenerfree restrooms if churches could just get air fresheners out of restrooms that would help a lot she said lake washington christian church made that step and the churchs fragrancefree efforts continue this month the church held a screening of the environmental documentary chemerical which explores the dangers of chemicals to clean our bodies and homes and offers recipes for toxicfree alternatives the films producer andrew nisker recommended first targeting laundry and dishwashing detergents which he suggested have some of the worst health and environmental impacts nisker has produced a cookbook of makeyourown cleaning products the environmental working group meanwhile offers a free database and guides to help identify the least toxic and fragrancefree personal care and cleaning products on the market policy is not going to change unless people change and stop buying products full of toxins nisker told huffpost consumer pressure may be responsible for announcements this fall from target and walmart both big box stores said they will begin rating products based on suspect chemicals this week reckitt benckiser maker of lysol woolite and airwick reported plans to disclose chemicals in its fragrances raising awareness in the religious community may be a powerful avenue for further change said nisker a lot of politics whether we like it or not has influenced policy for good or for bad and theres a lot of religion in politics he said ohio states heimlich agreed that churches are key venues for environmental progress churches are often a place where people are paying attention to things they may not pay attention to elsewhere heimlich said if something comes to them from the pulpit or the alter from that authority theyll hear it in a way they wont hear it from newspaper radio tv or from someone else also in a religious community you are caring about the other people in that community heimlich added cleaning your environment cleans it for everyone else too'}.

injecting political bias into her middle school classroom another complaint made anonymously informed administrators of volitichs twitter alias tiana dalichov and of her racially incendiary musings online following those complaints the district monitored volitichs social media made more visits to her classroom and interviewed students but at the time the kids did not substantiate the concerns about her teaching and administrators did not notice anything out of line earlier this year huffpost informed the district of a podcast in which volitich brags about bringing her political views into her social studies classes following the huffpost report volitich was removed from the classroom and an investigation was begun in april volitich formally resigned from her post this week the results of the investigation were released and reported by the citrus county chronicle the investigative report said that the inquiry had centered on whether volitich violated professional practices by being deceptive in changing her teaching practices when administration enters her classroom and by encouraging her students to go along with the deception indeed in a feb 26 2018 podcast volitich said that when parents complained about her inserting her white nationalist opinions into her teaching she lied to school administrators and said it wasnt true the investigation found probable cause for disciplining volitich but because she has already resigned the district will not be taking further action according to the report investigators interviewed 16 students and four other teachers most of the interviewed students had positive feelings about volitichs class and her ability as an educator most also said that she had a habit of discussing her political views in class but denied that they were told not to inform their parents or encouraged to change the topic when administrators visited but five students said volitich made them uncomfortable when she discussed topics like immigration segregation president donald trump and the democrats one student who is biracial told administrators that volitich described the ku klux klan as a good thing called for immigration to be shut down and said segregation should be restored in schools another student said that volitich told the class that democrats believe they need help raising pets or children whereas republicans dont believe they need help with such activities another said that volitich would sometimes talk about how hillary clinton should be in jail and claim that democrats want to raise your taxes of the four teachers interviewed one expressed concern about volitich injecting racial bias into her classroom practices and took issue with volitich allegedly seating black male students together the educator also described a tense conversation with volitich about politics in which the educator expressed fears that trump would try to get rid of black people in response volitich simply said well the educator alleges the parent who had filed the complaint last august told investigators about new comments made to his son volitich allegedly told the child that google is down because the democrats were busy helping to delete all hillary clintons emails district officials did not immediately respond to huffposts request for comment on the results of the investigation volitichs lawyer charles e moore also did not immediately respond to huffposts request for comment volitichs answer to the allegations is included in the investigative report she took issue with the inquirys results suggesting that media coverage might have primed students to remember more innocuous comments she also responded to many of the kids specific claims in response to the allegation that she said democrats need help raising pets and children volitich said she was teaching students about the two major political parties instead of arguing that clinton belongs in jail volitich claimed that she said clinton should be in jail if there is proof she committed a crime her comment about google and clintons emails was a joke she said over 85 of the students interviewed stated they learned a lot in my class felt they were able to express their own opinions and views denied my telling them not to talk to their parents about material discussed in class volitich wrote she also vehemently disagreed with the one former

public health concern experts say', body='small translucent blobs dotted the waikiki shoreline when angel yanagihara set out for a sunrise swim one early july morning in 1997 an old woman on the beach told me dont go in those are box jellyfish they are dangerous recalled yanagihara a biochemist at the university of hawaii but i looked at them and thought that was silly multiple box jellyfish stings landed her in an ambulance a short while later and she admitted regretting her quick dismissal of the advice yet the ordeal which culminated in three days of bedridden agony redirected her research she was determined to decode the mysterious sea creatures sting and then find ways to protect other swimmers fishermen and divers who might risk coming into contact with a potentially deadly jelly that risk may be rising according to some experts who hold the popular but controversial opinion that factors including discharge of sewage and plastics overfishing and climate change are creating ideal conditions for the hardy gelatinous animals to proliferate more than a halfbillion years on earth they say has provided the box jelly and its cousins with tools to handle the harshest environments and to exploit the misfortunes of other species that cant across the world were seeing more sinister types of jelly blooms in oceans that have been under pressures from our own mismanagement and our own pollutants said yanagihara regardless of whether jellyfish are taking over our oceans a point of intense scientific debate researchers agree that the sea animals are worthy of more attention research funding and public education jellyfish blooms are a problem that needs to be dealt with pronto writes lisaann gershwin in her new book stung on jellyfish blooms and the future of the ocean we are more frequently using the oceans putting our bodies and industries into the pathways of jellyfish blooms gershwin adds but despite our increasing use of the sea we have surprisingly few datasets about jellyfish every year some 150 million people are exposed to jellyfish around the world according to the national science foundation most jellyfish stings are minor but rare tentacle swipes from some types such as the box jelly can inject lifethreatening doses of poison in fact certain species of box jellies have been known to stop the heart of a healthy adult in less than three minutes yanagihara described the pain as the sensation of thousands of burning needles she was fortunate to survive an estimated 20 to 50 people annually are not so lucky in the philippines with the actual number likely to be far higher due to unreliable data according to gershwin more locals and tourists lose their lives on the tropical coastlines in australia thailand india china and papua new guinea among other countries deaths from irukandji box jellies are particularly difficult to track the sting itself often goes unnoticed and rarely leaves a mark but about a halfhour later a constellation of symptoms may develop including muscle cramps vomiting and hypertension in severe cases that end in heart attack or drowning a jellyfish may never be suspected the effects of jellyfish extend far beyond their sting of course blooms have capsized fishing vessels shut down nuclear reactors clogged desalination plants threatened an olympic triathlon and devastated fisheries since the 1980s according to the national science foundation blooms of jellies have cost the worlds fishing and tourism industries billions of dollars many fear the worst is yet to come jellyfish are more common than they used to be in many places noted mark gibbons a jellyfish expert at the university of western cape in south africa while we cant point a finger at any one culprit he said the coincidence is too great to be anything other than anthropogenic for most of those systems perhaps nowhere are box jellies more recognized than the coasts of northern australia which entered box jellyfish high season in october here blooms of box jellies have long been an annual occurrence but a 2012 study suggests rising sea surface temperatures mean an earlier arrival and later departure and thus a longer season of danger for public health robert condon a marine biologist at the university of north carolina wilmington led a separate study in 2012 that concluded the apparent rise in swarms of jellies may simply be an artifact of natural waxing and waning of global jellyfish populations on cycles of about 20 years his teamss analysis of data since the 1970s did show a slight increase over time he said but more waxing than waning phases were also represented in that time period the studies call for more monitoring in order to get a better grip on what to expect of the slimy creatures in the decades ahead in a lot of respects issues of blooms are kind of irrelevant said condon we know we go through rise and fall periods so we should prepare for that whats happening during future rise periods some south korean scientists envision that preparation in the form of jellyslaying robots they are currently testing prototypes but critics such as condon warn that such a technology may actually have the potential to enhance a jellyfish bloom releasing the eggs and sperm and creating even more jellies he recommends a thorough environmental impact study before any robots are set loose on the seas condon calls yanagiharas new technology meanwhile really clever yanagihara has developed a dualacting agent that blocks tentacles from shooting their toxic venom into the skin while also providing treatment for stings just in case the technology is the first thats designed for prevention yanagihara said which is crucial in the case of fastacting box jellyfish venom its been effective for every species weve tested so far said yanagihara the concoction is currently in the pipeline for us food and drug administration approval yanagihara said she ultimately hopes to have various versions including sunscreenlike lotions and iv therapeutics available to the public and out on the beaches for lifeguards and emergency caregivers us army special forces fisheries and others have already expressed interest she added worldrenowned longdistance swimmer diana nyad used the salve during her recordbreaking open water swim from cuba to florida in september she suffered box jellyfish stings three times during earlier unsuccessful attempts at the crossing yanagihara like other experts emphasized the importance of basic research and surveillance to help predict when and where dangerous jellies may appear she has a study coming out soon based on 16 years of data from hawaii which she said finds that while waxing and waning the overall trend has been of an increase in jellies and she has started field surveys of jellyfish in the northern mariana islands and the caribbean systems need to be in place to detect these things early said gibbons of the university of western cape suggesting the benefits of someday being able to predict the pending presence of jellies based on for example wind patterns but at the moment were in a very poor position to be able to understand enough of the biology and the way jellyfish interact with the environment to build good models citizens can help by reporting any jellyfish stings or sitings at

voices women vote group it is a mistake to accept that gop narrative and attribute credit to former president barack obama or insist its despite president donald trump and republicans the memo added voters especially democratic voters are genuinely struggling in this economy they remain in pain because rising costs outpace any pay increases the trio wrote that democratic momentum has stalled in recent months because the party has failed to focus on the economic and health care battles that most engage antitrump voters and because republican base voters especially white workingclass men could

the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections in which the gop scored big gains the strategists are hopeful a backlash to trump can spur a surge at the polls by such voters and lead to significant democratic

hear progressive messaging overall 51 percent of democrats said the midterms would matter tremendously compared with just 39 percent of republicans democrats sit at the edge of a landslide repudiation of president trump and republicans in the congress and states where they govern in november the memo said democrats have huge opportunities with minorities millennials and unmarried women and even white workingclass women that will allow them to dominate across battlegrounds in 2018 the polling found that by 50 percent to 42 percent democrats have the advantage in the generic ballot for senate

polling indicated democrats should discuss an economy rigged against hardworking people in my state and attack corporate donors and trickledown economics greenberg and company recommend focusing more on worries about longterm deficit problems with a message slamming politicians for their huge taxgiveaway to the big corporations and the richest 1 that will blow up and endanger our future a message from a democrat fed up with the rigged political and economic system is still popular with democratic base and swing groups but the deficits produced by the trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the rich have shifted the priorities among these voters the memo said they are consumed with the longterm impact on entitlements and investments for the future and the immediate reality that their urgent needs like education funding and help with health care will be put off yet again the memo also recommends a second message it says will help turn out young voters pushing for stricter gun laws

be russell wilson but first hed need to know a little more about how he ended up stranded on a deserted island with an elite qb in the first place why would i be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback whats my escape route we flying off we on a boat in the end the 2017 pro football hall of fame inductee twotime super bowl champion threetime pro bowler and historically great former broncos running back said hed have to go with wilson because hes mobile and theres all sorts of situations hes able to get himself out of davis 45 talked about that player safety anthem protests and more in an interview with huffpost on thursday morning davis was speaking to reporters as part of a promotional push for verizons new rewards program verizonup note verizon owns huffposts parent company oath the interview has been lightly edited for clarity and transcribed below huffpost lets say tomorrow you wake up and youve been named nfl commissioner with the absolute power to change anything in the league whats the first thing youd do davis i would go back to giving teams more time to practice more time for padded practices more time to develop players theyve really taken it away from the players and a lot of that has been done by the nfl players association but its kind of cheating the players in their development training camp is important the way were preparing players coming out of college especially the offensive linemen and running backs in trying to get the running game going you need actual practice in pads its hard to really get that running game going when youre just doing simulated drills or youre doing walkthroughs i know what it meant to me to get those reps in and im sure it would benefit a lot of other players whats stopping nfl commissioner roger goodell or the nflpa from doing that it all comes back to players safety and i think the one thing that hurts it is you have some coaches who abuse it and thats why they installed it initially you had some coaches who were practicing super long two practices a day with pads on im not sure how you could bring that back and try to make sure that its not being abused and that its being used properly if you could time travel what advice would you give yourself before your first preseason game in 1995 when you were pretty sure you wouldnt make the team just be ready for the opportunity when it comes its going to come i cant tell you when but when it comes be ready i know you fought through migraines in the past are you worried about chronic traumatic encephelopathy at all and how cte might affect you in the future yeah i think you certainly have to be this sport is relatively new and were just now starting to see players getting older getting their brains examined and having signs of cte so why would i think that im in the clear there are things that have happened in my life where i might forget something and of course my first thought is is this from playing football or am i getting older and im not sure i have a wife and three kids and youre always concerned about your health are you going to be around when they get older yeah i think about it i do know that when i played 18 years ago i thought i wouldnt let my kids play football ive changed my tune for a number of reasons one the sport has changed and the awareness is there if you get dinged and you see stars you now have to go through the proper protocol so i like what theyre doing with that going back to the grassroots people growing up playing football are taught differently the equipment is better techniques are being taught differently in terms of where your head should be placed they dont hit as much on all levels everything theyve done to decrease the chances of head collisions ive been happy with both of my sons play flag football and they want to play tackle and when its time to play tackle im going to let them play what would you tell nfl players who are concerned about cte and are looking at their future thinking of leaving the league early the first thing to do is look at what their history is if they have a history of concussions then i cant tell anybody to continue to play its really an individual decision if you dont have a history of it and you havent had any concussions or signs of head trauma i would tell them the game is safe and its getting safer every day i dont tell players whether they should play or not its just up to them if you were stuck on a deserted island with a qb whos currently in the league and you had to escape who would it be and why laughing why would i be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback depends on how were getting off the island whats my escape route we flying off we on a boat give me russell wilson man im a russell fan hes got all the attacks hes mobile hes able to deal theres all sorts of situations hes able to get himself out of hes a oneman showdown up there in seattle i like russell you came up with your famous touchdown celebration the mile high salute as a sign of respect for servicemen and women is there any advice youd give players who are kneeling during the anthem in protest of racial inequality no those players werent kneeling because they dont like the military i stand i also understand people who dont want to stand for the anthem and why theyre doing it its not about our military its not about them not liking america theyre just bringing attention to an issue in the communities that they come from and im all for that this is a country where were taught to fight for things we believe in and speak for people who dont have a voice ive spoken to a number of servicemen and women who have shared that they dont mind that thats what they fought for for us to have that platform and to have the right to do that so long as its a peaceful assembly in protest they were all for that i would say too that the first time people were protesting it brought awareness to that now the second thing is whats the plan after that if youre still kneeling and theres no plan then youre just kneeling to be kneeling if theres not a plan behind it after the first couple of times then thats probably not the best course of action i didnt have an issue with it because i understood why the players were kneeling is it foolish to try to keep politics out of sports i dont think you can i understand the nfl doesnt want to deal with that former broncos head coach mike shanahan had some rules with our locker room two things we dont talk about religion and politics and i understand because those issues get heated but its woven into our culture now that when we do something people insert politics its part of where we are now im not saying its foolish to try and keep it out i think its almost impossible to keep it out are you surprised colin kaepernick went unsigned no im not surprised in this league they dont need everybody they want you but they dont need you obviously the issues that were happening with him those owners werent willing to take that risk and then not really knowing if hes going to be a good quarterback or not hes better than some qbs in this league but is it worth the risk for them im not shocked he wasnt signed if you hadnt ended up in football what do you think you would have ended up doing oh my goodness i dont know i dont look at life like that i know my first move if id been cut in training camp would have been to go back to georgia and parlay my relationships at georgia with alumni and maybe work in atlanta somewhere maybe that wouldve been my first move but other than that i have no idea what my life wouldve turned out to be are you concerned at all with the drop in nfl tv viewership im not maybe theres a few reasons why that happened nfl viewership has gone up every year and at some point it corrects and it may have plateaued this year may have even shrunk a little bit but i think thats ok its such a big industry and the fan base the nfl has is tremendous now next year if it happens again i think the league be saying ok whats going on now but i think its going to go up again this year what is the future of thursday night football it seems like its hated by players and fans do you see it going away i dont see it going away anytime soon theres too much money the league is making on thursday night football and i know some of the players hate it but theres not enough groundswell and enough people pushing back against thursday night football for it to just go away i dont see that happening'}.

a state think so', body='by elaine s povich a bland oneparagraph item that appeared this fall in a lightly read weekly newsletter from the city manager in pasadena california has set off a firestorm in the online entertainment industry and in cities and states around the country the issue a plan to impose taxes on video streaming services like hulu and netflix backers of the internet streaming levy say its just another step in governments attempts to adapt the tax code to the modern world consumers no longer get dvds at the local blockbuster video store where they paid sales tax now they download movies and shows directly to their devices streamers should pay taxes too the tax advocates argue but opponents object to the way some jurisdictions are going about the tax officials in pasadena and other cities that have adopted similar rules such as benicia and indio california argue that regulatory rules adopted nearly a decade ago give them the right to extend taxes to streaming services foes led by the streaming industry say the issue needs to go before the voters or at the very least city councils or state legislatures before taxpayers start handing over more cash the move to impose taxes on internet streaming is another step in an effort by cities and states to tax services that are downloaded from farflung companies that likely dont have an office or other facility in that state the socalled amazon tax that some states are seeking to apply to outofstate internet sales is one example taxing cloud services with a businessuse levy is another the taxes are akin to taxing electricity that a utility generates outofstate but is consumed instate or like cellphone taxes on wireless service pennsylvania and the city of chicago took the lead on whats known as the netflix tax but not without controversy as part of chicagos 2015 cloud tax the city was ready to begin applying a 9 percent tax to digital entertainment but news reports prompted an uproar and consumers have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the tax which has been temporarily suspended and in august as part of pennsylvanias effort to address a 13 billion budget gap the state extended its 6 percent sales tax to cover digital downloads including music videos ebooks mobile apps and games at least 45 other cities were initially advised that they also could apply utility taxes like those charged for electricity and cable tv to video downloads including san bernardino glendale santa monica culver city and pico rivera the financial firm muniservices which helps cities with structuring and collecting utility taxes worked with the cities on the tax their taxes range from 45 to 11 percent beyond that streaming video services worry the utility tax extension or a form of entertainment or use tax could spread to other states and municipalities now according to muniservices attorney donald maynor the cities are reassessing and talking to the video industry about their products and how to fairly apply the tax the whole idea was to treat everybody the same he said that way we can keep our rates down and nobody gets a free ride joe henchman vice president of legal and state projects at the tax foundation a nonpartisan tax research group says governments are looking at emerging technologies and taking small bites of the tax apple which stirs up opposition from affected industries or groups as new things emerge very few proposals are structured as lets tax all services he said they are structured as lets tax this service that makes it a political thing despite the opposition henchman said as the economy moves inexorably in the digital direction the tax structure will follow thats where the money is pasadena problem in september a memo from pasadenas director of finance matthew hawkesworth attached to the city managers newsletter said his office had determined that all video programming should be treated the same regardless of technology or service supplier that meant they would all be subject to a utility users tax of about 9 percent approved by voters in 2008 before streaming video services became so prevalent the 2008 referendum said the utility tax would apply to any transmission of voice data audio video or any other information it passed by a 58 to 42 percent margin in his memo hawkesworth specifically mentioned hulu netflix sling tv and fullscreen media he said the tax would take effect jan 1 earlier projections estimated it would raise about 10 million a year news of the planned utility tax expansion drew quick complaints from pasadena residents and city officials said they would review the issue further a spokesman called hawkesworths memo premature the notion of extending the 2008 voterapproved utility users tax to additional cablelike services is under review said city spokesman william boyer there is no timeline for when the issue will be decided robert callahan the internet associations california executive director objected to using a utility tax to put an assessment on streaming video utility taxes have been applied to water sewer and cable tv the idea that we are taxing netflix and hulu like water doesnt make sense he said callahan did not dismiss the idea that a modern society might need to change the way taxes are assessed but said changes in the utility tax are not the way to go further callahan said that streaming companies would like to participate in any municipal or state discussion over taxation rather than having administrators simply extend an existing tax to their product with no debate david kline spokesman for the california taxpayers association an antitax group brought up another problem endemic to taxing pixels rather than hardware pixels are portable what happens if you subscribe to netflix in california but watch orange is the new black while on vacation in hawaii which state gets the tax is the city going to tax all your use of the service when its completely out of their jurisdiction he said thats almost impossible to audit chicago suit in 2015 chicago announced it would extend the citys 9 percent amusement tax and personal property lease transaction tax such as that paid on the lease of a car or other equipment to cover netflix spotify and other streaming services like pasadena the decision was made administratively without council action or a vote the city estimated the extended tax would bring in about 12 million annually to the cashstrapped city the nonprofit liberty justice center a libertarian group that believes in restraints on government power filed a classaction suit against the tax it looked to us like the city didnt have authority to do this particularly without city council action center attorney jeffrey schwab said the litigation put the brakes on the tax which was to have taken effect sept 1 2015 the ruling was issued without comment in a routine list of administrative changes it said that the city would now charge amusement tax on downloaded music like spotify or for the privilege of watching electronically delivered television shows movies or videos delivered to a patron in the city a spokesman for the citys legal department bill mccaffrey said that the city remains confident that the amusement tax properly applies to streaming video music and games and we will continue to defend against the ongoing litigation recently the city filed a motion to dismiss the case but the court rejected it schwab said theres a difference between the citys amusement tax which applies to shows and ball games and the internet streaming tax if you buy a ticket to a cubs game you pay a 9 percent tax but if you buy a ticket to a st louis cardinals game the city of chicago doesnt impose a tax on you however if you are a chicago resident and you watch a netflix movie in st louis you are taxed imagine schwab said if there was a netflix of poland would chicago impose a tax on residents who wanted to watch films in polish that seems like it goes way beyond the four corners of chicago'}.

humanitys existential crisis', body='i know what youre thinking i am proposing a sane world i must be crazy swami beyondananda japan just made reality illegal well maybe i exaggerate just a little reality is still permitted to exist in japan its just illegal to talk about it a new and thankfully very unpopular state secrets act makes whistleblowing and reporting leaks from whistleblowers illegal and punishable by 10 years in prison while this law was ostensibly passed to prevent state secrets being passed to enemies it is far more likely that the current batch of state secrets are to cover up the megadisaster at fukushima and the enemies are none other than the japanese people and people everywhere so while tepco can continue leaking radioactive poison into the ocean reporters cannot leak stories about it welcome to the world of institutionalized insanity where official media selling official stories insist that we the people ignore our eyes ears and senses not to mention worldwide reports of raised levels of radiation in alaska and california and mysterious dieoffs of starfish in the pacific fortunately we have organizations like project censored to publish a more balanced account and a respectable ecologist david suzuki to offer a grim warning indeed many of those who allow themselves to pay attention see the fukushima meltdown as what may be the beginning of the end of human life on earth and even more likely the collapse of civilization as we know it while there are actually people who get some strange juice from tales of doom and gloom i am not one of those and i am also not willing to put my head in the sand and pretend that the insane is somehow sane here is my sober assessment of the situation humanity has just received some alarming lab results that indicate we are suffering from a lifethreatening condition that will prove fatal unless we take immediate collective action we can speculate if the world leaders are just dazed and confused or whether there is a concerted effort to run out the clock and make sure that the population is appropriately controlled and drugged during the dying process either way it is now up to the people of the world do we want to live or do we want to quietly die again i say none of this lightly no one wants to face our children and grandchildren and say sorry about that guess we left you with lifethreatening challenges and an increasingly toxified world of scarcity but no worries you can still watch reality tv to avoid watching reality yes crisis precipitates evolutionary opportunity and the window of opportunity will only stay open so long when the window is gone well so long humanitys existential crisis humanity is undergoing an existential crisis in a very real way we are in the process of choosing if we want to exist or not as more and more of us are coming to see to navigate the evolutionary passage in front of us we will have to recognize ourselves as cells in one related organism having spent the past 5000 years focusing on survival of the fittest we all know that social darwinism predated darwin by about 4850 years we must now shift to thrival of the fittingest if we fit into the web of life we survive and thrive if we dont fit we dont survive and for those of you concerned about the financial costs of making these fundamental changes i offer this dire warning if humanity goes extinct there goes the gdp reading about the starfish dieoff the elevated radiation levels on the west coast where i live and the increasing dangers of a very poorly managed clean up at fukushima i admit to having dark thoughts this past week someone asked the swami if he believed in the big bang theory and he said well i used to but now i am leaning more toward the lone nut theory how else could we explain the nuttiness we are experiencing now so what would it be like for a critical mass of the uncritical masses to go sane and declare the physical world our sane asylum first we must face the dire prognosis with clarity awareness courage and resourcefulness to take a cue from a wise teacher jean houston maybe our entire species is undergoing a heros journey we must now collectively and individually of course face our demons and work together to overcome steep odds this means playing an entirely new game and while the outcome of the new game is still undetermined we do know that the old game will lead to death in spontaneous evolution bruce lipton and i talk about the phenomenon called spontaneous remission a certain percentage of patients who receive a dire prognosis and are told to go home and get your affairs in order miraculously recover while their recovery might seem like some anomalous act of grace it turns out that those who recover have something in common according to dr lewis mehlmadrona author of coyote medicine spontaneous remission is often accompanied by what he calls a change of story when bruce and i wrote this several years ago we thought of spontaneous evolution as a noun in the future i now see clearly it is a verb in the present our positive choice is to write and then live into a new story the dire prognosis is calling forth evolutionary change where we gather under one big intent to use our collective intelligence intelligently and our resources resourcefully we have the technological wherewithal to mobilize the global village now we need the awarewithall and the will and the willingness one of my colleagues and mentors donny epstein originator of network spinal analysis says pain is an invitation to progress societys institutions and misleaders in seeking to protect what must collapse are doing everything they can to numb or manage the pain as donny says to transform the pain we must first feel it acknowledge it and accept it what would it be like to have the conversation about the true state of the natural world in community in our churches and spiritual centers in our schools and of course in our families what would it be like to break this conversation through the soundless barrier so the media has to report it donny makes another very powerful distinction that applies here and now in his 30 years in the healing professions he has found that patients who declare i want to live are far more likely to survive and thrive than those who say i dont want to die please be with that for a few moments as a civilization that has lost its spiritual moorings and insists that only the material world is real there is a profound fear of death some sanity in this regard is emerging through the hospice and conscious dying movements still heroic endoflife interventions are still the costliest and most futile forms of medicine and along with change of story one of the markers for overcoming lifethreatening conditions is having a compelling future to live for so what would it be like for humanity to declare the future it chooses to live into seriously what if there was a positive proactive mission statement for humanity a vector pointing toward greater health wellbeing and sanity businesses write mission statements as do individuals who are up to something what if communities nations and even our entire human community declared what they seek to bring to the world doesnt it make sense that every region every state every nation has something that it does or creates better than anyone else what would it be like for a billion or two billion or three billion people to declare they are choosing a world where there is thrival for all and then what would it be like to actually create a structure and do something to demonstrate this some 70 years ago the united states gathered its greatest scientists and resources in a secret project the manhattan project to build the first weapons of massdestruction nuclear power what if all of humanity today called forth our current resources in a massive campaign to create renewable nonpolluting energy so abundant that no armies are needed to defend it we could call it the manhelping project to create a web of massconstruction new clear power imagine if this were done without the control of any government or single corporation but simply by a new entity that declared the mission and gathered the resource this is an idea whose time has come and it will only happen through our collective awareness intention and practical focus so as we begin a new year lets recognize that the evolutionary upwising is fully underway lets shoot way past apathy and despair and lets call forth the healing and transformational energy in our community and world lets take the bad news coming from japan and the pacific ocean as karma fuel to propel us toward what the swami would call humanifest destiny manifesting our destiny as a healthy and whole species proclaiming and then gathering around this sane center in the wake of this low point can be the turning point and set us on course to the tipping point'}.

below they no longer want to be on the defensive simply the usversusthem idea has to go the next 20 years will truly change the world jerre stead ceo of ihs a global consulting firm told a packed house at the colorado convention center last week during the colorado oil and gas associations annual conference now the opportunity comes along once in a lifetime maybe to make an impact on the world one of the ways we can help each other most is to be very proactive stop being defensive together if were going to create truly longterm national energy policy we need to be positive and consistent and speak as a single voice stead said the theme seemed to override every discussion at the convention last week speakers included peter kareiva the chief scientist from the nature conservancy calling for the oil and gas and conservation industries to work together as neither side will go away anytime soon and alex trembath policy analyst with the breakthrough institute a california think tank calling for a new ecomodernism that rethinks traditional environmentalist ideology and rejects the idea that man is ruining nature as industry officials and employees sat and listened more than a few raised their eyebrows at what they heard on the stage before them as speakers ushered in the era of cooperation even harmony with conservationists meeting fractivists in the middle and finding common ground the emphasis at the conference was to change the nature of the dialogue away from an usvsthem framework to one where we acknowledge that we are all in this together coga president and ceo tisha schuller said in an email response to questions we all use energy and the products of energy we all want to protect our family our community and our colorado natural environment polarization becomes a selffulfilling prophecy where we expect conflict and so further exacerbate the situation meeting in the middle is complex time consuming trying and messy but ultimately it is the only way to get anything worthwhile accomplished while the industry has grown in the last couple of years and helped colorado pull out of the great recession residents have become increasingly skeptical as they organize through social networking some organizing fracking bans in cities or calling for moratoriums to study the health effects residents have expressed concern about the types of chemicals used in fracking fluids formulas for which an increasingly competitive industry has been reticent to reveal lest lose an advantage residents worry about those chemicals seeping into ground water they show videos of fugitive emissions pouring from tank batteries polluting the air theyve called for action and want sound scientific proof the industry does not harm the environment or people as the industry encroaches more on urban neighborhoods and schools while the industry has attempted to answer the myriad questions surrounding their activities that have been ongoing in weld county for 40 years without dangerous health effects theyve faced increasing skepticism and stricter regulations most recently the colorado oil and gas conservation commission placed tighter setback rules for locating drilling activities near buildings the state air quality control commission is looking into stricter requirements on emissions from oil and gas facilities and operations stead speaking about how the industry will be looked at in history espoused the open and honest approach to dealing with detractors his method to communication was threepronged treat absolutely everyone with dignity and respect facts are friends and create a strong educational base for the future we have an opportunity to make a much bigger difference to look back 15 years from now and say we changed the world stead said if we bring resources together in this room and spend a fair amount of time treasure and talent creating an education system that helps people understand what we truly are doing what the facts are what an incredible difference we can make to the world we have that opportunity as an example he said officials need to tackle emissions headon be proactive of measuring controlling and reducing emissions stead said thats an example of where we can deliver facts as friends it will be a great example of activity making a difference on greenhouse gas emissions if we dont solve some of the domestic issues such as the residents concerns the country may lose out he said natural gas prices in india are triple what they are in the united states because of the increased natural gas production which is expected to make america a net exporter by 2020 world energy consumption he said is expected to increase 52 percent from 2010 to 2040 60 percent of which will come from asia stead offered reaching for

a 2010 report by the american bar association found they were on the rise no book nor diy method is an adequate substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney familiar with your particular circumstances says joy butler author of the guide through the legal jungle a statement made without a hint of irony yes there are plenty of resources for people who want to help themselves including the consumer financial protection bureau the federal trade commission and your state attorney general but its true theres nothing like lawyering up reality check i publish a list of executive contacts that can help you avoid darkening the door of a courtroom and by way of full disclosure i usually err on the side of doing everything myself ive only hired a lawyer twice in my life once to defend against a frivolous and ultimately unsuccessful defamation suit and another time to negotiate an employment contract but when do you say enough and call a professional when its complicated some consumer problems are simple some arent when things turn complex you may need to consult a pro says morris lilienthal a personal injury attorney its important to look at the complexity of the legal issue he says lilienthal recalls a recent case when a plaintiff gave a recorded statement to the other drivers insurance company even though the other driver was the atfault party the recorded statement he gave to the other insurance carrier was used as a basis to deny his claim he remembers if youre unsure of yourself you can make mistakes a lawyer can help when you need an expert if your consumer dispute requires someone with a deep knowledge of a subject you may need to lawyer up you should consider an attorney when expertise is necessary for example certain areas of tax business law or intellectual property says evan walker a lawyer based in la jolla calif you can quickly find yourself in deep water in a consumer dispute and youll benefit from the steady hand of someone who knows their stuff when youre being threatened if someone is threatening to take you to court you should talk to an attorney a consumer whos been merely threatened with a lawsuit should at least talk to a lawyer if not hire one says daniel watts an attorney based in carlsbad calif for example say you write a negative review of a sandwich shop on yelp and the business owner threatens to sue for defamation consider at least asking a lawyer to review the complaint this takes just a few minutes of a lawyers time adds watts but its worth it when youre being sued if someone has filed a lawsuit against you then you need to fight fire with fire consumers should absolutely consult an attorney if they are sued says sara j oconnell a san diegobased lawyer and with good reason in court you could lose some of your rights if you dont follow certain rules or meet certain deadlines so youll want someone who knows the ins and outs of the system when theres a tricky contract involved its true we live in a diy world says jr skrabanek senior counsel with the snell law firm in austin texas but there is no substitute for an attorney when a consumers complaint arises out of a contract especially one containing a mandatory arbitration clause a forum selection clause or a choice of law clause these provisions are typically though not always enforceable yet they massively influence a consumers options and pathways for actually achieving relief engaging in a fight without an attorney in such a situation is fraught with peril says skrabanek when youre confused and that happens more often than you think you read a contract one way a company interprets it differently everyone can read a document and understand what the literal meaning is says allie petrova the managing partner of a tax and business boutique law firm based in greensboro nc a contract may tell you that new york law applies but will not show on its face how a savvy attorney or a judge would interpret the contract under new york case law and statutory law people often miss nuances and details that could work in their favor a lawyer can help with that now that youve decided you need a lawyer theres just one small detail the cost lawyers are expensive the average hourly rate for the typical consumer law attorney is 361 according to the national consumer law center thats a lot of money you can either pay up or consider

that had nothing to do with vekselberg columbus novas lawyer told the new york times novartis a pharmaceutical giant acknowledged paying essential consultants llc 100000 per month for one year 12 million total and said that any agreements with essential consultants were entered before our current ceo taking office in february of this year and have expired they said the payments were for healthcare policy matters a sevenpage document prepared by michael avenatti an attorney for stormy daniels the adult film actress said that cohens company also received money from korea aerospace industries the company told bloomberg it paid cohen one 150000 payment for advice on what the outlet refers to as local accounting standards a spokesman maintained that their contract with cohen was legal we also know that the special counsel team headed up by robert mueller has known about all of this for awhile novartis told the wall street journal that muellers office contacted the company about six months ago in november 2017 cohens attorney stephen ryan did not respond to huffposts inquiry about the payments but told the atlantic only that the money essential consultants llc received from columbus nova was not a payment but tuesday nights revelations still leave us with more questions than answers here are a few of the big ones several of these companies had business before the government or a vested interest in legislation the government was considering but how did they come to pay the same shell company that cohen used to pay stormy daniels what were they expecting in

activity reports filed with the treasury department by a bank that handled money paid to cohens llc banks are required to file such reports also known as sars when they know or suspect that transactions involve money laundering or violate the bank secrecy act avenatti said the treasury department should release those reports and claimed that officials had rejected his prior requests to do so some have speculated avenatti has already gotten access to those reports and that they were the basis of the document released tuesday he pushed that point on twitter later tuesday evening saying there was no reason why the sars should not be released demand it he concluded so far the white house hasnt commented and referred questions to trumps outside lawyers trump lawyer rudy guiliani said he didnt know anything about essential consultings work and cohen has likewise remained mum but cohen has long been trumps personal lawyer and a trusted fixer as recently as last month trump maintained that cohen was still his lawyer even though he has moved to distance himself from the man in recent weeks youll have to ask michael cohen trump told reporters aboard air force one in

report says investigators hired by the county were looking into the may 1 crash of a public website that was displaying returns on election night in a report released friday sword shield enterprise security said no election data was compromised in the apparent denialofservice attack but that they did discover an attempt to exploit the backend database behind the web server officials said the server was only storing data meant for public display was not connected to any system where the raw votes were being tallied and no vote tallies were compromised its not connected to any live databases david ball the knox county deputy director of it told huffpost none of it is primary information thats kept on that server its a repository for being able to report to the public and we have intentionally kept any primary data extremely isolated investigators traced two of the ip addresses involved in the attack to ukraine and the uk according to the report they also said ip addresses from an unusually high number of foreign countries approximately 65 targeted the website on election night the most requests came from canada the uk chile france and italy addresses associated with russia did attempt to contact the network according to the report but not as many times as those associated with other countries did sword shield analyzed web traffic on election night and saw symptoms typical of a denialofservice attack a type of cyberattack meant to crash or slow down a website during the same time period they said they saw an attempt to breach the publicfacing election results website investigators reenacted the attempted breach and discovered a vulnerability in the database behind the public website they were not sure what exactly caused the crash on election night but did say the website crashed when they were testing the vulnerability themselves there is not a clear indication whether the web site crash was due to the traffic of the investigators scan the vulnerability being accessed a combination of both or another external factor the report said adding that further testing would determine the cause ball declined to discuss the specifics of the vulnerability citing security practices but said officials promptly removed it once they learned of it the attempted breach was similar to the attacks that several states experienced during the 2016 presidential election he said the disclosure comes as states are working to improve their election security after attempted russian hacking during that election in this case it was just a matter of there was a way to get in to look around but that was pretty much the extent of it ball said its not clear what the hackers were interested in the it official said but there was a range of possibilities it might have been one of those things had the election data been actually living on that server there might have been an attempt to alter that or there might have been an attempt to redirect traffic from the real website to a phony website somewhere else ball said after discovering the exploit investigators reviewed the countys system for storing election results they noted that election data is physically transported from polling places to an isolated central repository officials use memory cards to physically transfer the data from that central repository to separate computers to upload onto the web this process provides data integrity no data is carried back to the isolated master system that contains the official election results the report said due to the lack of network connectivity and the fact that all data that goes into the isolated master system can be validated back to each polling station and to each polling machine no compromise of official election data could have been carried out philip stark a professor of statistics at the university of california berkeley who is an expert on election auditing reviewed the sword shield report and said questions still remained the assurance that no data could possibly flow from outside the tally system into the tally system is basically this is what knox county told us he said in an email also missing from the report he said was any indication of whether the country reused memory cards and if so how often it wiped them as well as confirmation that the voting machines had no wireless functionality ball said the countys election systems dont have any network functionality at all the memory cards that carry the results from a central tabulator to a networked workstation are reused

case poised to wreak havoc on top programs', body='new york it has been five months since the fbi arrested 10 men in a sweeping federal probe into the underbelly of the basketball world as the three ongoing criminal cases resulting from the investigation plod along its increasingly unlikely there will be another wave of doubledigit arrests more legal charges still could come but whats becoming increasingly clear as the discovery portion of the case comes to a close is that the breadth of potential ncaa rules violations uncovered is wide enough to fundamentally and indelibly alter the sport of college basketball the soundtrack to the three federal basketball corruption cases is essentially a ticking time bomb which will inevitably explode it will impact every major conference hall of fame coaches a score of current top players and some of the nations most distinguished and respected programs multiple sources whove been briefed on the case and are familiar with the material obtained by feds told yahoo sports that the impact on the sport will be substantial and relentless sitting under protective order right now are the fruits of 330 days of monitoring activity by the feds which one assistant us attorney noted thursday was a voluminous amount of material that includes wiretaps from 4000 intercepted calls and thousands of documents and bank records obtained from raids and confiscated computers including those from notorious nba agent andy miller this goes a lot deeper in college basketball than four corrupt assistant coaches said a source who has been briefed on the details of the case when this all comes out hall of fame coaches should be scared lottery picks wont be eligible to play and almost half of the 16 teams the ncaa showed on its initial ncaa tournament show this weekend should worry about their appearance being vacated theres a general expectation that this information will be released it could come in trial pretrial motions or released by the government at some point no one is certain if theyve agreed to eventually give it to the ncaa if it doesnt go public so how bad could be it in terms of ncaa rules multiple sources told yahoo sports that the material obtained threatens the fundamental structure and integrity of the sport as theres potentially as many 50 college basketball programs that could end up compromised in some way among the documents expected to be in the federal governments protection are the bank records of miller who bankrolled middle man christian dawkins who is at the center of two of the cases if the ncaa is going to get andy millers bank records god bless them i dont know what theyre going to do said another source with direct knowledge of the situation chuckling at the thought you are better off changing the rules the crazy part of this business is none of the kids are free ncaa officials are staring at the prospect of a tournament with a winner that will likely be vacating its title and many others eventually vacating their appearances theres a lingering mushroom cloud over the sports upcoming showcase event that wont go away the most fascinating and tricky variable here is time theres a protective order on the evidence found in discovery in all three cases whether the information gets out in dribs and drabs or released at once the consequences are expected to be severe the government is not compelled to release the information according to daniel richman a former federal prosecutor in the southern district of new york who now teaches at columbia law school sometimes never he said when asked generally about the timing of the release of information under protective order he added the main sources of release will be in the course of pretrial motions and trial andor as related investigations go overt whats certain is that theres enough compromising information to rock the sport to its core there will be thousands of pages of documents hundreds of hours of wiretaps with the voices of prominent coaches brokering deals with the middlemen sneaker executives and talent traffickers will it trickle out or get released all at once thats complicated and procedural the ncaas involvement in this case so far has been minimal theyve been in consistent contact with the federal investigators careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations whenever the information is released from under protective order the ncaa will have to continue to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations as they begin their own millers financial activity is expected to compromise dozens of programs and players but he certainly wasnt a rogue agent rather miller was jockeying for clients in a competitive field where agents consistently exhibited similar behavior miller did not return a call seeking comment the routine nature of agents runners and financial advisors operating in a world rife with payoffs bag drops and kickbacks leaves the federal investigators at a fascinating crossroads the biggest mystery in this case is why more highprofile coaches and agents havent been brought in said the source who has been briefed on the case as witnesses paint a picture of the depths of corruption in the basketball underworld the feds need to make a decision whether they want to expose other sneaker companies agents and coaches so far theres been no indication that theyre prepared to do that the basketball underworld is sophisticated and nuanced a black market forged over decades of moving players even with all the wiretaps and documents the feds are still catching up on how it all worked the craziest part of it all is that they could have walked into one of 15 agents offices and its just as bad said a source with direct knowledge of the situation it just would have been other people and other schools there had been a flurry of activity in the case in the past week that had conjured some optimism for the defense attorneys a wall street journal report about an undercover fbi agent under investigation and a motion filed revealing a paperwork error appeared to poke some holes in the case those matters will ultimately have to be addressed but any momentum for the defense attorneys was abruptly and tersely halted thursday morning judge lewis a kaplan presiding on the 26th floor of the daniel patrick moynihan united states courthouse in lower manhattan denied a motion to dismiss one of the cases with the legal equivalent of a dikembe mutombo finger wag after a blocked shot lawyers for three of the defendants adidas executives merl code and jim gatto and business manager christian dawkins had filed for a motion to dismiss the cases based essentially on the notion that the universities in the cases couldnt be considered victims they were after all benefitting from the players and their performances on the court as kaplan listened impatiently to gattos lawyer michael s schachter argue the motion the judges mood vacillated between annoyed and ornery his reactions to schachters arguments included it would be quite a stretch are you kidding me and ive actually read the indictment he made one jab about the media attention the case has generated and ultimately dismissed the motion by saying that schachters arguments would be better heard by a jury schachter declined comment the trial for that case will begin on oct 1 and the case involving former auburn assistant chuck person and clothier rashan michel starts on feb 4 of 2019 another judge set the date for the third case which includes the other

it responds to your changes you are able to alter vegetation and climate while watching their effects on the surrounding organisms in this way and many others digital games provide excellent opportunities for players to learn about complicated subjects including the concept of evolution through natural selection even games designed for fun and not specifically for education can provide rich concise dynamic representations of complex science technology engineering and math topics since i was young digital games have successfully supplemented the educational process in a range of topics including math science and biology research shows that if these games are going to actually teach those concepts they must represent them accurately games that include incorrect depictions teach the wrong lessons since charles darwin and alfred russel wallace evolution has been understood as a process based on genetic differences between individual organisms of the same species there are three key principles some colleagues and i looked into how well current games could serve as educational tools specifically about evolution we examined how darwinian evolution was represented in 22 games which we located either through game databases like gamespot or ign or through google searches most games got evolution at least partly wrong only five accurately represented all three key principles of evolution a screencapture of a norn interacting with its environment in creatures 2 developed by creatures labs and published by mindscape wikipedia creatures provides a rare example of the three principles in that game players create cartoonlike creatures called norns through a process that allows norns to be altered not just in terms of appearance but at the genetic level for the most accurate representation of evolution the game offers a play mode called wolfling run in that mode players cannot directly affect their norns but can observe their relative fitness for a particular ingame scenario the potential variations in both norn creation and the environment they must survive in provide for an astonishing number of evolutionary possibilities maxis best known for creating the simcity game series and its spinoff the sims collection also made a set of games called simearth and simlife like simcity both give players topdown control of a world simearth was designed for players to make major changes to the weather landscape and animals to create an environment players were then able to see how the animals would fare in this created environment simlife was more specific it has players engage with the animals rather than merely creating them to learn about the biology surrounding their survival a screencapture of who wants to live a million years playable on the science channel website from sciencechannelcom we also found two academically oriented games that loosely presented the three mechanics of evolution selection game and who wants to live a million years which was later renamed charles darwins game of survival the two games were designed to be simple tools that could be played quickly in places like museums despite the limited mechanics present in such games they still clearly show each element of the evolution process the most commercially popular game we found didnt quite get evolution right spore left out something many other games did too organisms genetic differences didnt affect their survival rates instead organisms whose genes were unfit for the environment would not necessarily die more often in keeping with evolutionary principles rather players could intervene and increase an organisms likelihood for success by say helping it move more intelligently and strategically beyond the scope of its genetically predisposed movements nevertheless spore does a reasonable job presenting the broader concept of evolution to players and is the best such game made this century creatures simearth and simlife are all from the 1990s spore is also still available for purchase so it is the only game readily usable by the average educator or student but other findings were disappointing most games inaccurately portrayed evolution usually in the same way spore did allowing player intervention to save organisms that were unfit for survival for these other games evolution becomes more akin to mutation during a single organisms life than a process that occurs through generations in evo search for eden and lol lack of love players earn points they can spend to modify their organisms in eco at the end of each level the player arbitrarily changes an attribute though not necessarily one that affects an organisms survival prospects in each of these cases what the game calls evolution is actually external genetic manipulation rather than inheriting particular traits these inaccuracies may confuse those unsure of what evolution actually is if other scientific subjects are similarly poorly depicted in video games the potential educational benefits of these games could be lost however as game designers become more adept at modeling scientific themes it could herald an educational revolution alex

mans son brother and nephew now blankenship wants his vote', body='shrewsbury wva don blankenship had been out of prison for only seven months when tommy davis started seeing his face and hearing his voice everywhere blankenship launched his bid to become west virginias next republican senator late last year and started buying advertisements on local tv stations they all began with a line that nauseated davis im don blankenship candidate for us senate and i approve this message davis stopped watching the local news to avoid the ads retreating to the reliably blankenshipfree zones of hunting shows and netflix but then blankenships voice was there in davis pickup truck via pandora radio advertising davis had to limit his use of that too lest driving around town become its own form of torment it seems no matter where i go or what i do its don blankenship davis 50 said recently driving along the kanawha river in his toyota tacoma blankenship is the former massey energy chief executive who presided over the upper big branch mining disaster in montcoal west virginia in 2010 davis was a miner at upper big branch with his eldest son cory davis his only brother timmy davis and a nephew joshua napper davis was making his way out of the mine during a shift change when the explosion happened he bolted to the exit wind and rocks tumbling around him and made it out alive twentynine men did not including his three loved ones the bodies of his son brother and nephew were recovered together days after the blast once it was safe to do so cory was the youngest of the dead at 20 years old various investigations faulted massey officials for systematically cutting corners on safety and putting profits before their workers lives they found that massey under blankenships helm had fostered a culture of fear and intimidation inside the mine and hidden safety lapses from regulators blankenship served one year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws he has continued to deny responsibility for the worst mining catastrophe in four decades the particular void left by cory boy as davis still refers to his son my hunting partner my fishing partner my allaround goto buddy has made the blankenship redemption tour an unbearable spectacle for davis just as it has for other upper big branch families i actually thought he would stay the hell out of west virginia davis said of blankenship he just wont leave it alone hes trying to put it back in our face i call it harassment he continued thats what it is its straightup harassment blankenship has spent 2 million of his own money on the campaign and has savaged his main republican primary opponents congressman evan jenkins and west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey in hopes of facing off in a general election against incumbent sen joe manchin d whom he personally blames for his prison sentence blankenships campaign did not respond to several interview requests for this story although blankenship has slipped behind jenkins and morrisey in recent polls buried in attack ads the gop establishment is funding to keep him off the ticket his candidacy is not a joke for all his infamy plenty of voters still associate him with goodpaying bluecollar jobs in hollows without a whole lot of them as davis put it there are still people around here who worship the ground he walks on the prospect of sen don blankenship however unlikely has polluted even the most solemn customs for davis on april 5 he and other upper big branch families made the drive up to the mine to observe the eighth anniversary of the disaster davis carries out the same ritual each year he picks up 29 balloons 26 black and three orange the latter signifying his family members then heads to corys grave with his exwife cindy their two sons seth and nathan and their grandson cory tripp there they release the balloons and talk then its on to the mine site where each of the dead has a cross davis hangs a wreath for all the miners and lays out three white roses for his family members he ties a white bandana to corys cross he looks up to the spot on the mountain where he and the other miners would punch out at the end of their shifts then they drive down coal river road to the 48foot granite memorial that was erected in 2012 showing 29 miners silhouettes it was at the memorial where things got unpleasant at this years anniversary gathering among the families politicians and news crews was gwen thomas the sister of grover skeens one of the miners who was killed thomas has taken an unusual position among upper big branch family members she has called the disaster an act of god and praised blankenship who in turn has featured thomas in a television ad and on the campaign trail the presence of an outspoken blankenship supporter at the memorial was too much for davis and other mourners she defended the former ceo they gave her a piece of their minds a state trooper intervened davis has tried to curb his facebook time during the senate race the night before the anniversary he visited blankenships campaign page where the candidate posts videos and says hell bring jobs back to west virginia davis uploaded a photo of corys gravesite onto blankenships page here look at my cory boy 20 years young davis wrote tell him why you chose production over safety the next time davis visited the page his post was gone on a recent friday morning davis steered his atv up a gravel road to a former stripmining site the back of his vehicle loaded with turkey decoys spare camo clothes and a 12gauge shotgun what had once been a mountaintop now felt more like prairie with long flat stretches of grass and brush lying between hills davis used to work on sites like this one as a surface miner as they were stripped now he comes here to run his dogs call for turkeys or climb a treestand and wait for a buck the time in the woods is bittersweet it was his brother timmy who taught him how to hunt and davis passed everything he knew on to cory who shot his first whitetail when he was 9 now he mostly hunts alone but he appreciates the quiet of the woods more than ever besides any time spent in a treestand is time spent not drinking if i sit at home and dwell on things he said with a turkey call in his mouth itll just fuck me up a few months after the disaster davis went back to work at a mine run by alpha natural resources the coal giant that would go on to acquire massey he still had a ringing in his ears from the blast and what would turn out to be posttraumatic stress disorder he struggled with loud sounds he had panic attacks i just couldnt sleep he said i couldnt think i couldnt function i was getting lost i was having problems he accepted a settlement for his sons death and stopped working some families used their money to leave the state and start new lives davis stayed in west virginia but as a slightly different person he covered his body in tattoos including 29 crosses along his back and the words cory boy across his shoulders he customized a harley as a rolling memorial to upper big branch a couple of years ago he sold the house where cory grew up because the memories were too painful he bought a small ranch house at the end of a street of trailers that backs up on the kanawha far enough from the highway that all he hears at night is the river he started an annual scholarship at corys high school in his name the unofficial mission is to give kids better options than hoping for a coal resurgence the lack of goodpaying work is why people cling to someone like blankenship davis said just look around you there aint a hellacious lot to do here if you didnt go to college he said the guys who support blankenship they dont have other options as far as jobs go moving on has not been easy he ends up at corys grave every other night or so drinking a beer and turning one upside down for his son corys friends are at the stage where theyve started families and davis finds himself wondering if cory would have had a son too would he have been tall or short fat or skinny would he have looked more like him or more like her and other questions well never know the answer to blankenships visibility and lack of contrition have made it all the harder he has maintained contrary to official investigations that the root cause of the blast at upper big branch was a sudden influx of natural gas in the mine rather than an excessive amount of coal dust which is highly explosive the distinction is crucial coal operators have an obligation to keep coal dust levels in check through sufficient ventilation and rockdusting a process that neutralizes coal dust with pulverized limestone what happened at upper big branch was investigated by federal regulators state regulators the united mine workers of america union and an independent panel established by manchin who was west virginias governor at the time to varying degrees they all faulted massey for poor ventilation and inadequate rockdusting practices in the mine the explosion likely started when the shearer on a mining machine ignited a methane fireball thanks in part to poorly maintained equipment but it would have been the high levels of coal dust that sent it ripping through more than 2 miles of the mine shaft so that even men far from the blast couldnt escape the umwa went so far as to title its report industrial homicide davis remembers the dust being so thick that day he could see it other miners recalled the air belowground flowing in odd directions before the explosion blankenships natural gas theory conveniently absolves him of the chronic failures investigators found its just not substantiated said celeste monforton a safety expert who was part of the independent panel which also faulted federal and state regulators for not adequately policing massey it was a coal dust explosion the fingerprint mapping that was done to find a cause all of that evidence indicated that she said all of the analytical work that was done taking all the dust samples an extraordinary amount of evidence showed that blankenship has also claimed that the federal mine safety and health administration forced massey to change its ventilation plans before the explosion suggesting msha may be to blame for the disaster the independent panel found no evidence of that however it did find regulators failed at upper big branch by not cracking down hard enough on massey as blankenship has blamed natural gas and msha for the disaster while on the campaign trail robert atkins has been there to factcheck him atkins lost his son jason at upper big branch he has made a point of showing up at blankenships town hall meetings to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut blankenships telling of events he estimates hes gone to five campaign events and has spoken oneonone with 50 voters urging them to vote for anyone but blankenship his wife joined him for the first event but couldnt do any more she just couldnt take it atkins said ive got in my head and i feel im right that that man killed my son and when he killed my son it took the life out of me out of his mom and out of his brother the man has no remorse according to the independent panel the deeper cause of the disaster was what they called the massey way under masseys corporate culture miners were to run coal at all costs the mine continued operating even when airflow was dangerously low workers lacked basic safety equipment while having to file regular production reports methane detectors were disabled to avoid having to shut down the mine if levels got too high and workers were instructed to tip off colleagues belowground when federal safety inspectors showed up massey enforced this system through intimidation investigators found workers testified after the explosion that they did what they were told because they feared for their jobs managers belittled miners who couldnt get with the program the company had a slogan s1 p2 for safety first and production second according to davis the joke among miners was that it was really p1 s2 as his atv lurched up and down the ravines davis tried to explain the grip blankenship had on his mines he had worked at other massey properties before upper big branch he remembers eating lunch out of his pocket as he worked reluctant to slow production with a proper break he didnt speak up about hazards either fearful of losing the job that he desperately needed he recalled the pressure workers felt whenever blankenship showed up in his car or helicopter someone would shout to him as he cut coal with the highwall miner machine tommy whatever it is youre cutting keep it rolling do not stop do not stop that money was feeding their kids and paying for their trucks they were proud of that and didnt want to lose that davis said don blankenship scared those people to death three upper big branch managers went to prison before blankenship all found to have deceived regulators or investigators in covering up safety problems blankenship was charged with three counts securities fraud making false statements to officials and conspiring to violate mine safety regulations a jury found him guilty only of the latter charge davis attended every day of the twomonth trial that he could making a point to sit near blankenships supporters he wore the same outfit each day so blankenship could better recognize him a plaid shirt with a green jacket and an under armour hat the oneyear sentence handed down the maximum the judge could impose under the misdemeanor conviction infuriated davis considering blankenship had been facing up to 30 years under the original charges the conspiracy charge was not directly linked to the disaster itself outside the courthouse a television reporter asked davis why he was so frustrated his raw and eloquent response delivered with a quaking voice would be viewed over a million times online if you was where i was that day and you seen my son after laying in there for five days and seen what he looked like if you worked on them men like we did when they come outside if you smelled them and you looked at them then youd know where i come from the 12month sentence didnt make blankenship any more penitent he declared himself a political prisoner he published a 67page booklet from his lowsecurity prison in california proclaiming his innocence and propagating conspiracy theories about a government coverup he promoted a 2014 documentary hed funded called upper big branch never again faulting the feds for the disaster he blamed manchin personally for his prosecution taking his feud to twitter as west virginias governor manchin was at upper big branch in the days following the explosion he and davis have since become friends davis said he often gets a call from a number he keeps in his cell as senator joe and its manchin asking how hes doing they talk about motorcycles blankenship and whatever else davis has on his mind manchins uncle died in the farmington mine disaster along with 77 others in 1968 davis said manchins campaign has never asked anything of him though he would happily oblige if it did particularly if blankenship wins the republican nomination on may 8 hes the only politician whos been there the whole time davis said of manchin he wont say it but i will on a thursday in midapril davis learned that blankenship would be attending a meetthecandidates forum that night in chelyan just across the river from davis home he was surprised the senate hopeful would have the nerve to show up to a public event so close to upper big branch an area where blankenship campaign signs appear to be sparse davis had told himself that he wouldnt attend town hallstyle events knowing he might lose control in an encounter with blankenship he decided to bend his rule he removed the gun from his truck and told his buddy gary price to meet him down at the community center where blankenship would be when davis got there a handful of police officers who already knew him came outside to greet him they told davis he could say whatever he wanted to blankenship so long as he kept some distance and didnt threaten him davis took a sign from his truck and laid it across his windshield it said cory davis 52289 4510 don blankenship murdered him over coal and money price parked his truck in front of the buildings main exit dragging a custom trailer that has a dedication to cory on one side and the names of every miner killed at upper big branch on the other davis waited outside to confront the candidate as he left the event he saw blankenship walk to the glass doors and stop the memorial display laid out in front of him then he watched blankenship turn and head toward another exit accompanied by what appeared to be an aide they hopped in a car and left before any words could be exchanged with davis another republican candidate jack newbrough came out the doors to take a break im sorry for your loss tommy he said shaking davis hand i sure would love to have your support davis let the invitation hang in the air he thanked his friend price for coming out then headed to his truck and off to the bar to have a beer although there was no confrontation he considered his trip to the forum a success he felt hed shamed blankenship for coming into his end of the valley he noted that blankenship never looked him in the eye he believes the man feels guilt despite everything hes said to the contrary that boy of mine he cant speak out no more so i speak out for him davis said thats why i do it to make sure blankenship doesnt forget it just like im sitting here thinking about him now hes driving home thinking about cory and those men'}.

basically in charge of regulating elections now', body='facebook began disclosing political advertising on its site on thursday two years after a russian troll factory bought ads to influence the 2016 presidential election the new policy is meant to shine light on the previously undisclosed ways that politicians and other groups aim to shift public opinion on elections and political issues but the selfregulatory approach will occur at facebooks direction and without any public oversight the social media giant will require all electionrelated ads and many issuerelated political ads placed on its platform and on instagram to disclose the buyers identity the advertising budget how many people saw the advertisement and their demographic information age location and gender starting from may 7 2018 all ads will remain in a searchable archive for seven years users will also be able to report advertising that they believe should be disclosed as political the company says it will hire 3000 to 4000 content moderators to review these complaints and will deploy machinelearning algorithms when possible you can read more about this plan on facebooks blog in addition to ads that explicitly call for the election or defeat of a candidate facebook is also targeting issuebased advertising the company explained in a blog post that it worked with the nonpartisan comparative agendas project to select 20 issues that will be covered by the disclosure policy ranging from abortion to foreign policy to social security an ad calling for the department of education to ban the use of public student loans at forprofit colleges for example would need to be disclosed an ad run by a specific forprofit college that simply promoted the school would not facebooks new policy follows the companys revelation to congress in 2017 that the internet research agency a russian digital propaganda company that works with both the public and private sector in the country purchased advertisements for a range of pages that sought to inflame american racial tensions and that depending on the page advocated for the election of donald trump hillary clinton jill stein or bernie sanders in some cases these pages bought ads to gain followers in the us and later called for voters to boycott the election facebook ceo mark zuckerberg first announced plans to require political ad transparency in a speech from facebook headquarters in september 2017 while facebooks moves are supported by advocates of online political advertising disclosure the new policy also highlights how the failure of elected officials and regulatory agencies to impose actual disclosure rules through the democratic process is enabling the private sector to assert its authority over the conduct of us elections facebooks new disclosure plan is not bound by federal regulations and will not be overseen by the federal election commission or the federal communications commission in 2014 ann ravel then the chairwoman of the fec proposed a meeting to discuss the disclosure of online ads her republican colleagues pilloried her for the suggestion and conservative news sites claimed she was trying to destroy free speech and censor their views ravel received a torrent of antisemitic death threats and the three fec republicans voted against a rule to mandate online ad disclosure the failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failure john wonderlich executive director of the protransparency nonprofit sunlight foundation told huffpost so now we have private sector campaign finance regulation thats a pretty dystopian present the public is now left with the facebook election commission and maybe the google election commission and the twitter election commission both google and twitter have proposed some form of online ad disclosure on their respective platforms after they were also used by russian trolls in 2016 for now online political ad disclosure will be balkanized as digital platforms will have different policies due to a lack of federal enforcement in some cases that may result in stronger disclosure requirements than congress or the fec would mandate as seen with facebooks broad issueadvertising disclosure approach in other cases though the lack of public enforcement will likely result in worse outcomes indeed that is also the case with facebook which launched a searchable archive of political ads that is only accessible if you have a facebook account this means a person must submit to facebooks terms and conditions including the collection of personal data if they want to learn about the election ads purchased by us politicians rob leathern facebooks director of product said on twitter that the company is considering ways to open the archive to nonusers a facebook spokesman said the company would not collect data on what people search for in the political ad archive in order to better target ads at them sen mark warner dva a lead sponsor of the honest ads act a bipartisan bill to officially mandate online ad disclosure praised facebooks decision in a tweet but noted the underlying problems of industry selfregulation big step in the right direction and im glad facebook followed through on my recommendations to improve upon earlier proposals warner tweeted thursday ill be pushing other companies to follow suit but until we pass the honestads act therell still be a patchwork of disclosure across social media so far the republicancontrolled congress has refused to move the bill through committee or to the floor

accounts for about 89 of all retail sales a number that continues to grow second quarter 2017 ecommerce sales were about 5 higher than first quarter sales more of what we buy is bought online but we are also buying less merchandise rents for commercial real estate continue to decline and it is obvious that we have a lot of empty storefronts in welloff parts of new york city and in shopping malls around america more and more of our time is spent doing things rather than accumulating things about 80 of the us gdp and the us employment market is in the service sector of the economy in fact according to the us bureau of economic analysis americans spend a growing amount of their time making and consuming services from physical therapy to movies from concerts to nail salons americans consumption patterns are changing as a proportion of our total consumption food clothing and other merchandise are declining while services are growing its not that we no longer require material possessions but that the nature and style of consumption is changing real estate development is beginning to reflect the growth of ecommerce and the service economy one victim of this change is the suburban shopping mall this past spring hayley peterson of business insider observed that the real estate industry has taken note of these changes by repurposing existing malls and cancelling or scaling back new ones in a wall street journal article published last week keiko morris reported that while many people remain attracted to single family detached homes and separation of residential and commercial space a growing number of young people are attracted to more walkable environments where they can live work and shop in a single area walking biking or hopping on a train seem to be viable alternatives to sitting in endless and growing traffic jams hanging out in a public park seems to be a reasonable alternative to mowing the lawn with the growth of global commerce and communication we have seen a degree of homogenization of material goods and commercial experiences one reaction to that trend is a desire to find or build local communities of distinct character a main street style of commercial development doesnt require two big anchor department stores and dozens of national chains it can evolve over time and adjust its mix of residential commercial and business spaces commercial space can be priced to enable small distinct local retail shops a sense of place is difficult to convey within a giant enclosed space surrounded by acres of parking lots malls tend to all look the same because their economic function and business model dictate a particular design main street type developments like cities can evolve over time and take into account local needs markets culture and geography the density achieved through these main street developments makes it possible to achieve the economy of scale required for new infrastructure that is environmentally sustainable microgrids can be installed to permit the use of renewable energy and ensure energy efficiency this can reduce the cost of a developments operation and maintenance microgrids also provide resiliency because they can operate when the central grid is blacked out the use of permeable surfaces such as plantings in street medians green roofs and unpaved parklands can reduce flood impacts while creating an amenity the developments design can take drainage into account and take advantage of the natural contours of the land the cost effectiveness of water supply sewage treatment and waste management can be enhanced by carefully designed concentrated urban developments the trend toward a sharing economy is also facilitated by urban density sharing clothing cars furniture and other material goods is easier when people live close together the cultural switch from material consumption as a means rather than an end is well underway and sharing material goods enables a less resource intensive economy it is gradually becoming less socially desirable to be seen laden with shopping bags at the mall that sort of kardashianlike behavior is seen by some as a form of gluttony if the goods you really need are delivered to your home in overpacked amazon boxes then the act of shopping is no longer recreation but simply a less notable chore required to obtain a commodity this social change toward urbanization and different forms of consumption is never uniform and older people in particular cling to their familiar and comfortable lifestyles in the united states the price of housing remains the one material possession that still requires a substantial part of a familys annual income in many parts of the country the best housing buys are in the outer rings of suburbia where single family development and the auto culture is the norm that pattern will persist and will probably be reinforced once electric cars become cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion powered vehicles but even in these areas we are seeing multistory condostyle development and main streetalternatives to traditional malls the pull of a new cultural norm experiencing rather than consuming could be long lasting its physical manifestation in patterns of land use development is difficult to predict environmentalists and climate activists often make the case that consumption of some material goods must be sacrificed on the altar of environmental sustainability suvs motorboats and red meat are typical targets opposing consumption that people like is politically perilous particularly if that case is being made by welleducated coastal elites it can come off as particularly arrogant when seen through the eyes of an outofwork or underemployed midwestern factory worker who would love to have the problem of overconsumption the issue is avoided if the trend toward different rather than less consumption holds while its never a good idea to predict the future the growth of the service economy the impact of ecommerce on real estate development and the growth of the sharing economy are each undeniable new technologies will continue to change consumption patterns land use and social norms we dont know what shape it will take but i believe we have an opportunity to ensure these changes result in an exciting sustainable life style in

body='this entry has been cowritten with dr heikki koskenkyla and dr peter nyberg the 1st of january 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the european common currency the euro despite its success from 1999 to 2007 after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members for example living standards in italy and greece are below the levels when they joined the euro finland is the only nordic country using the euro and it is also the only nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008 there have been many proposals on how to fix the euro and the emu but they are politically unpopular and unrealistic in this blogentry we will argue that the euro will almost surely fail we just do not know the exact timing of its demise problems of the euro are structural and persistent the problem of the euro can be visualized in the development of the gdp per capita see figure 1 germany has been successful in the eurozone while greece and italy have not france is not doing well either the jury is still out for finland the different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries over time this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union these differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production however when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump this is an asymmetric shock the detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states when the dollar union of the us threatened to fall apart during the great depression federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones the federal budget also increased rapidly and in practice income transfers became permanent the no bailout policy of crisishit states had already been enacted earlier according to the ecb competitiveness of the german economy has improved by around 193 percent greeces competitiveness has improved by around 65 percent frances around 39 percent finlands around 17 percent and italys around 09 percent since 1999 thus the differences in competitiveness are large for survival in its present form and size the eurozone needs a similar income transfer system that is a full political union as in the us there is no europeanwide polling data on a political union but it appears that the support for the eu is diminishing in its core in a recent survey 40 percent of finns wanted to leave the eu also only 53 percent of dutch are against a new referendum on the eu which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand for permanent income transfers you would need to change the maastricht treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements there is only a very small likelihood that these would go through for example in finland and in the netherlands funds unions and reality because there is no public support for a federal european union many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro the ceo of the european stability mechanism esm klaus regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund this fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur the fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries however because of the persistent differences in competitiveness its transfers would become permanent like in the us only the most competitive members of the eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund any financing through the european central bank ecb would need to be covered by european taxpayers later when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ecb thus in practice there are only two ways to fix the euro a farreaching political union proposed in the five presidents report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the maastricht treaty where member states would be responsible for their own economies only no bailout in a full political union there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the eurozone and its member countries tax and social policies would be unified labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a europeanwide system a european debt relief system and banking union would be set up these would ensure the flexibility of wages prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards this could work in theory but the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the european level is extremely small returning to the maastricht treaty and to the no bailout rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted esm and the european financial stability facility would be wound down after their current programs would end ecb support qe and omt programs would stop this would lead to the default of greece and its likely exit from the euro in the longrun asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro the eurozone is in a stalemate a federal union would be needed to fix its problems but there is no public support for it returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits halfway solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues therefore there may be no way to avert the partial or complete breakup of the eurozone in the years to come the fate of the euro may already have been sealed'}.

seventh season sustaining a career in the nfl is not easy the average career lasts just over 3 years the lowest of any of the four main sports in the us and that includes practice squad players who never even play in a game also nfl contracts are not guaranteed meaning players even stars can be cut at any time before inking a deal with the packers jean francois enjoyed two productive seasons with the washington redskins playing in all 32 possible games seven of which he started while recording 57 tackles including 35 sacks just how rare is such production from a seventhround selection according to a 2015 study by forbes the median of percentage of games started by seventhround picks from the 2010 draft from 20102015 is 0 percent in other words the mere fact that jean francois has become a starter while more than doubling the nfl career average is almost unheard of as a result the techobsessed 30yearold who was cut by washington despite having one more year on his contract has a unique perspective when looking ahead to life after pro football despite being a star player and winning a national title at college football powerhouse louisiana state university he knew the odds of a career werent especially high developing his business acumen became a priority for him early on during my rookie season i spent a lot of money he says i was like do i really want to be this type of guy i didnt want to just spend money because you wont get it back the next year you couldnt pay me to spend a dime after i signed a contract with the colts in 2013 i realized that i needed a retirement plan according to the national bureau of economic research 78 percent of nfl players go broke within three years of retirement and 157 percent file for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement the 6foot3 313pound jean francois this years proud recipient of the redskins media good guy award did not want to become one of those statistics so jean francois started to ask around the league talking to veterans coaches and anyone who would offer advice he started to educate himself going through an assortment of different business and economic publications forbes fortune and bloomberg are his favorites with the help of his financial manager he then purchased a dunkin donuts location in georgia before long he owned 25 franchises throughout the south and he still has plans to expand to houston he committed himself to the business in every offseason understanding the nuances of the business as he would an nfl playbook at first it was a grueling process learning about projections and parsing through spreadsheets but soon it became second nature he still feels a thrill every time one of his stores beats the sales projections it opened up another world i didnt know existed jean francois adds i have to be handson so i can see everything grow i gotta learn how to do it myself when challenges such as consistency in the product and service presented themselves jean francois leaned on his football background and his experience working with a team but hes never had a problem with a single employee football helped me mentally because i had to get my mind right he says making sure everybody has a positive vibe jean francois says is paramount i gotta make sure that i set the mindset of people in there to be happy teamwork is the most important thing it can make things work better in other words if football is a brotherhood business is a community business helped me become a better person he says business makes you open up as a person because now youre more wellrounded early on in the nfl you get influenced by the rollsroyces the ferraris the lambos the next thing you know youre broke and out of the league and while business has made jean francois smarter and more focused it was the birth of his son six months ago that changed his perception of life my son when he looks at me i want to be the right father figure jean francois says he inspires me i thought i grew up already but when he came along i was like okay i really didnt grow up when i look at him it all makes sense these days jean francois who is of haitian descent sees inspiration everywhere including in frequent trips to the small caribbean island nation as a means of giving back to local communities in need but the question still remains what will life after football look like his 3 million deal with the packers is only for the 201718 season then hes not sure where hes headed but he does have one big idea despite lacking any tangible experience within the stock market id like start a hedge fund jean francois says another option though is heading back to school he wants to earn an executive mba in his hometown at the university of miami through a new artists and athletes program that has drawn rave reviews created in 2015 and aimed in large part toward football players it employs a schedule that allows players to train early in the morning before going to nine hours of classes complemented by latenight study sessions to be sure its no easy task but jean francois certainly thinks it can be done fellow defensive end carlos dunlap for instance earned pro bowl honors for the cincinnati bengals this year while also completing his mba and considering jean francois is already acing statistics why would anyone doubt him email me at

canaries in the coal mine', body='when his beloved great pyrenees malcolm died of bone cancer at age 6 luke robinson resolved to learn why i didnt even know dogs could get cancer he said the nagging mystery would send robinson walking over 2000 miles from austin texas to boston with his other two dogs to raise awareness for canine cancer it would also inspire his launch of an organization devoted to finding an answer through the discovery of links between dog and human tumors breast cancer was the first cancer we funded said robinson cofounder of the nonprofit 2 million dogs under a microscope a mammary tumor from a dog and from a person look the same as the prolific pink ribbons seek to remind us this month breast cancers grip remains strong and its reach everexpanding one in eight women in the us will now face the diagnosis a rise of 40 percent in just one generation perhaps less wellknown however is that most breast cancers are not hereditary and that cancer is the leading diseaserelated killer of dogs with mammary tumors the most common type afflicting females early spaying significantly reduces the risk of such tumors these facts combined with mounting evidence of harm posed by certain chemicals used on carpets couches food bowls squeaky toys and manicured lawns enjoyed by people and pets has led some experts and advocates to recommend a shift in breast cancer research and funding only about 10 percent of breast cancer research dollars are devoted to its environmental causes according to a federal interagency report published in february dogs drink our same water they are exposed to the same toxins robinson said the logical assumption is that indeed there is an environmental basis for these cancers but a lot of research and funding comes from pharmaceutical companies and theres no money in cause and prevention overall growing interest in canine cancer has led to new comparative oncology research at the university of pennsylvania and princeton university with financial help from 2 million dogs investigators are treating shelter dogs that have developed mammary cancer while gleaning information about the progression of the disease the researchers hope to identify treatments that will benefit both dogs and humans penn veterinarians previously studied dogs involved in sept 11 search and rescue missions thought to be exposed to chemicals in the rubble they found no elevated rates of major health problems in the decade after the attack dr rodney page director of the flint animal cancer center and professor of medical oncology at colorado state university said his canine research is the only us study underway aimed at identifying potential environmental risk factors for cancer and other diseases the study which began in september 2012 is attracting interest from federal agencies including the national institute of environmental health sciences the golden retriever lifetime study will eventually enroll 3000 puppies from across the us and follow them for several years investigators will collect dna urine feces fur and toenail clippings from the dogs that may show chemical exposures and will ask owners questions about their pets reproductive cycles and living habits page noted that his team has been enrolling spayed and unspayed dogs in order to better tease out the role of hormones in breast cancer cases and to ensure enough cases of breast cancer in the study this is a unique opportunity and could provide a wealth of information said page owner questionnaires are quite detailed asking such things as dog chew toy descriptions sleeping material details dog food ingredients and food bowl composition page said time is a key advantage of studying dogs while humans may develop cancer at an average age of 60 the average age of diagnosis for a dog is age 6 and of course there are a lot of dogs around to study about one mutt for every four americans by combining on any environmental exposure issue humans and dogs in the same location you can make a bigger case for the potential impact or abatement of a particular thing said page who once mapped cases of pet cancer in long island during an investigation of a potential human breast cancer cluster another surprising benefit of studying dogs is their mouths according to sharima rasanayagam director of science for the nonprofit breast cancer fund both dogs and humans can absorb chemicals under the tongue lab animals such as the mice commonly used in studies of toxic chemical exposures only absorb through their stomachs the sublingual route results in far higher levels of exposure reported authors of a study published in june on dogs exposed to bisphenol a a hormonedisrupting chemical known as bpa bpa and phthalates key ingredients in many plastics and vinyls may readily leach from some dog toys according to a separate study published in november were really living in a soup of chemicals said rasanayagam not only do you have carcinogens that can directly cause cancer but you also have endocrine disruptors that can set you up for an increased risk last month the breast cancer fund published a report linking prenatal exposure to bpa to laterlife diseases such as breast cancer this month the organization launched a beyond the pink campaign to prioritize prevention the pink movement has been fantastic in raising awareness and helping people who get breast cancer to move towards a cure and give them hope said rasanayagam but what we would love would be for fewer people to get that diagnosis in the first place i think we have a lot to learn from our companion animals rasanayagam added virginia mcphail participated in one of 2 million dogs puppy up fundraising walks last year in kansas her alaskan malamute storm was diagnosed with cancer at the same age as robinsons malcolm and the same week that mcphails daughter mandi steele also received the dreaded diagnosis that christmas in 2005 she recalled storm and mandi commiserating both didnt feel good both did hurt mcphail said mandi died less than a month later from a neuroendocrine carcinoma despite a prognosis of six months to a year storm went on to live another five years with multiple myeloma he was my lifeline said mcphail i think storm was left there for me mcphail shared her suspicion that chemicals in the environment may have played a role in both illnesses storm would play in the ditches and run through the local farm fields she said dr barbara nattersonhorowitz a cardiologist at the university of california los angeles devoted a chapter of her book zoobiquity and much of an upcoming conference to comparing cancers and possible causes across species breast cancer has been found in animals ranging from kangaroos and koalas to water buffalo and beluga whales nattersonhorowitz said unfortunately almost all physicians are quite unaware that nonhuman animals suffer from most of our human problems said nattersonhorowitz and there could not be a bigger medical problem than breast cancer dr larry norton one of the nations foremost breast oncologists may be an exception he said he keeps an eye on mammary cancers in our mammalian cousins including our domestic fourfooted friends and believes the information these creatures provide may be potentially transformative for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer he will participate in a panel on the topic at the zoobiquity conference next month in new york not only do mammary tumors in dogs and humans look much the same but they behave identically forming masses building blood vessels spreading through the body and destroying normal functions said norton deputy physicianinchief for breast cancer programs at memorial

points at nra convention', body='in his address at the national rifle associations annual dallas convention friday president donald trump swerved to thank kanye west for supposedly doubling his africanamerican poll numbers before getting right to the point lets talk about guns shall we the president then proceeded to dole out some questionable information on guns gun control and people who carry guns here are the highlights the statistic trump cited comes from the crime prevention research center which claims that in a span of more than six decades 98 percent of mass shootings occurred in gunfree zones take it with a big grain of salt the study was authored by john lott a gun rights advocate and author of a recent controversial new york times oped on background checks the meaning of the statistic heavily depends on how both mass shooting and gunfree zone are defined an official definition of mass shooting doesnt exist and theres a lot of debate over which incidents count and which dont the fbi stipulates that three or more people must be killed for the term to apply but lott defined it as four or more deaths in public by doing so he discounted private residences where domestic violencerelated shootings have occurred he also did not count shootings that were part of another crime such as a robbery theres also no official way to define gunfree zone which may apply to places where civilians cant carry firearms but officials can the way lott chose to define it in his research is questionable for example he considered military sites like fort hood to be gunfree zones even though guns are clearly present there that guncarrying civilians lead to crime prevention is an old nra talking point a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun experts strongly dispute this idea the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine concluded in 2005 that no link between righttocarry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data politifact deemed the statistic trump cited friday only halftrue there is no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares that this school is a gunfree zone trump said at the convention repeating his proposal to arm some teachers and school security guards huffposts rebecca klein spoke to teachers and law enforcement officials about trumps idea and found many of them were against it including the national teachers unions many worried that such a policy would do more harm than good and lead to a lot of students being injured by accident at school anyone who hasnt received the extensive training provided to law enforcement officers will likely be mentally unprepared to take a life especially the life of a student assailant mo canady the executive director of the national association for school resource officers said in a statement we all know whats going on in chicago but chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country trump said friday trump and others in the progun crowd have long held up crime rates in chicago as evidence that gun control doesnt work although both illinois and its largest city do have strong gun laws chicago is a short drive from both wisconsin and indiana where laws are significantly weaker studies have found that most of the guns used in crimes in chicago come from out of state with many coming from much farther away beyond that trumps comments ignore the fact that homicides and shootings in chicago have actually been on the decline for more than a year in 2017 chicago had the ninthhighest homicide rate of any us city paris france has the toughest gun laws in the world said trump going on to explain how a small group of terrorists armed with ak47s brutally killed more than 130 people in the french capital in 2015 if one employee or just one patron had a gun the terrorists would have fled or been shot and it wouldve been a whole different story this is another of trumps favorite talking points which hes been using since the november 2015 bataclan massacre putting aside for a second the absolute chaos that might have ensued if an arena full of armed concertgoers had decided to open fire on their assailants in the pitch dark trump is also leaving out some broader context with its strong gun laws the overall firearm death rate in france is about onequarter of what it is in the us although violent crime is not unheard of in paris the city experiences just a fraction of the homicides that an american city of a comparable population does gun homicides also appear to be primarily an issue among rival criminal gangs i recently read a story that in london which has unbelievably tough gun laws a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds said trump yes thats right they dont have guns they have knives and instead theres blood all over the floors of this hospital were not really sure what trumps point is here if hes noting that all violence is not gun violence then sure but the fact that londoners are making it to hospitals to receive care is significant knives tend to be less lethal than guns and its far easier to injure or kill larger numbers of people often indiscriminately or unintentionally by shooting than it is by stabbing a recent study in the us found that more gunshot victims are dying before reaching the emergency room than they were a decade ago even as trauma care has improved one theory for this trend is an increasing intensity of violence suggesting people may be getting shot more times at closer range with highercaliber rounds or simply while farther from the nearest hospital theres no saying how much worse the problem would be in london if it were as easy to get a gun there as it is in the us'}.

of the immigrant caravan is backfiring', body='the trump administration sought to make an example of 11 migrants who officials say were part of a large refugee caravan by making a public affair of hauling them into criminal courts rather than putting them through the civil deportation system but president donald trumps caravan prosecutions are already hitting roadblocks lawyers are challenging most of the normally openandshut misdemeanor immigration prosecutions and using the presidents tweets and public statements about central americans to do it the severity of the cases hardly matches the outsized pronouncements from us attorney general jeff sessions prosecutors have offered to release most of the 11 migrants based on time served if they agree to plead guilty then they would then take their claims to immigration court having their currently clean criminal records stained with a conviction in an unusual step though at least six of the 11 alleged caravan members are seeking to have their cases dismissed entirely contending the trump administration selectively prosecuted them based on their national origin as it sought to deter central american asylum seekers some secured reduced bonds which may allow them to fight their cases without being jailed runofthemill immigration prosecutions are rarely celebrated with press releases and statements from the attorney general as these were sessions actions have done something he likely didnt intend hes given them the right to a courtappointed attorney and new legal defenses for cases that have historically been extremely difficult to win the 11 migrants three women and eight men were arrested in late april and accused by border patrol agents of taking part in a caravan of hundreds of central american asylum seekers the caravan organizers dispute that saying the 228 people who had crossed through the port of entry at san ysidro in san diego to make asylum claims were the only ones officially affiliated with their group the department of justice filed criminal charges against the 11 on april 30 the prosecutions were unusual because three involved mothers traveling with their children and at least five plan to seek asylum two categories the government had typically put directly into civil immigration proceedings rather than filing criminal charges but they promise to become more common after sessions implemented a zero tolerance policy this month calling for the referral of all migrants arrested at the border for prosecution with the express intent of separating families who cross illegally although immigrants are deported on the orders of immigration judges in civil courts crossing into the united states illegally is a crime the first offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison subsequent offenses can be punished with up to 20 years in prison depending on the persons criminal history because of the threat of long sentences and the ease with which prosecutors can win at trial all they need to secure a conviction is an affidavit signed by a border patrol agent or documentation showing a previous deportation defendants almost always plead guilty and public defenders rarely urge immigration defendants to go to trial knowing that their clients would likely remain jailed while their cases play out because they often cant afford to post bond but the original 10000 bonds sought by the government have already been reduced in several of the caravan cases a judge ordered thursday that olga george of honduras could be released on an unsecured 5000 bond without requiring a deposit just her signature in another case morena mendozas bond dropped from 10000 to 5000 and the judge allowed her to be freed with a 500 deposit according to court filings in both of those cases lawyers argued that their clients are not flight risks because they are seeking asylum in the united states judges had lowered bond for three others by thursday in some cases the judges allowed the migrants to be freed with a cosignature from someone with enough money to pay a lowered bond of 5000 instead of requiring a deposit in all of the contested cases courtappointed lawyers argue that the judges should dismiss the charges based on what they say is selective prosecution by the government five of the migrants being prosecuted were traveling in a group of 18 people including three indian nationals and the border patrol arrested all of them but only four hondurans and a guatemalan in that group were charged and none of the indians becoming part of the group of 11 publicized prosecutions the government has not revealed the identities of the others in the group although attorneys asked them to do so as part of discovery all of the 11 alleged caravan members being prosecuted are from el salvador guatemala honduras and mexico this kind of invidious discrimination based on alleged country of origin is forbidden by the equal protection guarantees of the fifth amendments due process clause eric fish a federal public defender in san diego representing several of the migrants wrote in one of the court filings to prove that there is selective prosecution

uber is definitely not a joke in the sense that it is large company that has rattled the taxi industry in the united states and around the world it has also raised many important regulatory issues as it has sought to evade longstanding regulation of the taxi industry many of these regulations were clearly protectionist in nature with the purpose of securing the position of an entrenched cartel however other regulations like background checks of drivers and insurance requirements for passengers serve important public purposes while uber has preferred the route of simple evasion of regulations it is likely that we will see a much needed modernization of regulations in this area while ubers impact on the taxi industry is clearly not a joke the market valuation of the company may well be uber is not yet publicly traded but its market value has been estimated as being as high as 70 billion that compares to a market value of just 510 billion for auto giant gm and 446 billion for ford these are longstanding companies that both make close to 10 billion in annual profits by contrast uber is losing billions of dollars a year investors are not ordinarily prepared to pay large amounts of money for the stock of companies that lose money the stock certificates might be pretty but presumably at the end of the day investors will want to see profits there are two stories whereby uber turns itself around and becomes a hugely profitable company the first is that it will soon drive out enough of its competition so that it will enjoy nearmonopoly status in many markets this will allow it to raise its prices enough so that it can then turn large profits there are two problems with this story one technical and the other legal the technical problem is that it is not clear whether the technology of the taxi industry lends itself to monopolies its not that hard to have an app for calling cabs nor is it hard to hire drivers if uber were to up its prices by 2030 percent it would likely find many new competitors in the market the other problem is the legal one predatory pricing to gain a monopoly is textbook anticompetitive behavior this should lead to antitrust action by the government and lawsuits by competitors this is undoubtedly a major reason that uber has staffed itself with former top obama administration officials of course donald trump has probably never heard of antitrust laws the other turnaround story for uber is that it was never really about taxis but rather selfdriving vehicles uber is going to be the behemoth of the selfdriving vehicle industry and dominate this market the way ibm once dominated computers and microsoft dominated software the problem with this story is that uber would have to beat out a large number of major competitors including the existing auto companies apple google and undoubtedly many smaller tech companies that seems like a long shot so lets try alternative number three ubers stock is nearly worthless but for now people are willing to pay lots of money for it this shouldnt sound farfetched if you have heard of aol priceline or more recently groupon in each case stock valuations soared into the tens of billions or even hundreds of billions before plunging to a small fraction of this amount in such cases we see a massive redistribution of wealth often from pension funds and other institutional investors to the visionaries who were able to sucker them folks like steve case the former ceo of aol are incredibly rich today because of their talents in this area perhaps uber ceo travis kalanick is following in his footsteps but there is another aspect to the ephemeral value of highflying companies that eventually come down to earth uber actually is spending lots of money on research the same applies to many other low or no profit companies or their major shareholders such as telsa and amazon telsa ceo elon musk and amazon ceo jeff bezos have both committed large amounts of their companies andor their own money to research in areas like solar power electric cars and reusable space crafts its not clear at this point whether this is money that is especially wellspent we only get the information that they choose to make public however one clear outgrowth of these huge stock valuations whether or not they subsequently prove to be justified by future profits is the funding of large amounts of research in new technologies in many cases this is research that we might have envisioned the government financing in prior decades just as it did for the development of the internet whether or not the research proves very useful remains to be seen in any case we have effectively outsourced governmentfinanced research to these newly rich marketers who are in turn relying on funding from institutional investors some of whom are also in the public sector its certainly better to have these folks financing research rather than just buying more islands and yachts but fulfilling the childhood dreams of the newly rich hardly seems like the most efficient mechanism for supporting research unfortunately in donald trumps america it may be the only one available'}.

often miss the annual white house victory visit due to scheduling conflicts but turnout for wednesdays event appeared to be lower than for a previous patriots visit in 2015 to some players absences were notably linked to politics the new york times first pointed out the stark difference between photographs of the event this year and those from 2015 the last time the patriots won the super bowl the earlier photo shows about 120 people including players and staff standing behind former president barack obama on wednesday there were barely more than 50 people alongside trump patriots turnout

is pretty straightforward im an idiot stallman said in an email to the washington post it was my idea it was my execution it was my blunder i made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time once we learned more we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible of course at that point the damage was done i just needed to own it wednesday was the fifth time the team has gone to the white house james said and the number of players attending has ranged from about 27 to 50 heres what gripes me the scrutiny with which the visit to the white house has been handled by the press james said never before have we had players being asked are you going to the white house there were only a few players who came out who said they dont support the president and werent going for that reason notably absent wednesday was patriots quarterback tom brady who canceled at the last minute citing personal family matters according to a statement obtained by espn brady also missed the festivities in 2015 but attended the three previous visits trump didnt mention brady but he did call out several players by name

week that alan branch would skip the ceremony because of trumps sexist remarks and wouldnt want to spend time away from my family to shake the hand of a guy i wouldnt want to meet with or talk to defensive back devin mccourty told time in february he would stay away explaining the basic reason for me is i dont feel accepted in the white house trump has personal ties to the patriots as various

reach us waters by 2014', body='by jeremy hsu livescience contributor a radioactive plume of water in the pacific ocean from japans fukushima nuclear plant which was crippled in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami will likely reach us coastal waters starting in 2014 according to a new study the long journey of the radioactive particles could help researchers better understand how the oceans currents circulate around the world ocean simulations showed that the plume of radioactive cesium137 released by the fukushima disaster in 2011 could begin flowing into us coastal waters starting in early 2014 and peak in 2016 luckily two ocean currents off the eastern coast of japan the kuroshio current and the kuroshio extension would have diluted the radioactive material so that its concentration fell well below the world health organizations safety levels within four months of the fukushima incident but it could have been a different story if nuclear disaster struck on the other side of japan the environmental impact could have been worse if the contaminated water would have been released in another oceanic environment in which the circulation was less energetic and turbulent said vincent rossi an oceanographer and postdoctoral research fellow at the institute for crossdisciplinary physics and complex systems in spain fukushimas radioactive water release has taken its time journeying across the pacific by comparison atmospheric radiation from the fukushima plant began reaching the us west coast within just days of the disaster back in 2011 fukushima radiation leak 5 things you should know tracking radioactivitys path the radioactive plume has three different sources radioactive particles falling out from the atmosphere into the ocean contaminated water directly released from the plant and water that became contaminated by leaching radioactive particles from tainted soil the release of cesium137 from fukushima in japans more turbulent eastern currents means the radioactive material is diluted to the point of posing little threat to humans by the time it leaves japans coastal waters rossi worked with former colleagues at the climate change research centre at the university of new south wales in australia to simulate the spread of fukushimas radioactivity in the oceans a study detailed in the october issue of the journal deepsea research part 1 researchers averaged 27 experimental runs of their model each run starting in a different year to ensure that the simulated spread of the cesium137 as a tracer was not unusually affected by initial ocean conditions many oceanographers studying the oceans currents prefer using cesium137 to track the ocean currents because it acts as a passive tracer in seawater meaning it doesnt interact much with other things and decays slowly with a long halflife of 30 years one advantage of this tracer is its long halflife and our ability to measure it quite accurately so that it can be used in the future to test our models of ocean circulation and see how well they represent reality over time rossi told livescience in 20 years time we could go out grab measurements everywhere in the pacific and compare them to our model journey across the pacific rim the team focused on predicting the path of the radioactivity until it reached the continental shelf waters stretching from the us coastline to about 180 miles 300 kilometers offshore about 10 to 30 becquerels units of radioactivity representing decay per second per cubic meter of cesium137 could reach us and canadian coastal waters north of oregon between 2014 and 2020 such levels are far below the us environmental protection agencys limits for drinking water by comparison californias coast may receive just 10 to 20 becquerels per cubic meter from 2016 to 2025 that slower lesser impact comes from pacific currents taking part of the radioactive plume down below the ocean surface on a slower journey toward the californian coast rossi explained a large proportion of the radioactive plume from the initial fukushima release wont even reach us coastal waters anytime soon instead the majority of the cesium137 will remain in the north pacific gyre a region of ocean that circulates slowly clockwise and has trapped debris in its center to form the great pacific garbage patch and continue to be diluted for approximately a decade following the initial fukushima release in 2011 the water from the current power plant leak would be expected to take a similar longterm path to the initial plume released rossi said but the plume will eventually begin to escape the north pacific gyre in an even more diluted form about 25 percent of the radioactivity initially released will travel to the indian ocean and south pacific over two to three decades after the fukushima disaster the model showed you can follow jeremy hsu on twitter jeremyhsu follow us livescience facebook google original article on livescience copyright 2013

former female employees according to charges the women filed last month at the equal employment opportunity commission the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases one woman says her boss at the fulfillment center where workers pack and ship verizon products came by to offer her a peppermint dropped it in her hand then reached down and grabbed her breast another womans boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague according to her complaint after she reported the incident to the human resources department her boss treated her more harshly and wrote her up for not working falsely she says in the complaint she quit in january filed in two batches at the eeoc in early and late april the charges show what pervasive systemic sexual harassment looks like for lowwage workers of color the warehouse workers are primarily african american who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of me too stories which tend to focus on highprofile men and more elite typically white women while the first batch of charges got some local press attention the discrimination claims filed in late april have not been previously reported in this case the discrimination charges were not filed against verizon nor do they involve the companys employees instead workers have filed their claims against their direct employer xpo logistics a multibilliondollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with verizon on wednesday ahead of verizons shareholder meeting the national womens law center a womens economic rights nonprofit and four other groups sent a letter to verizon ceo and chairman lowell mcadam urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the memphis facility other signers include the womens nonprofit a better balance the tennessee branch of the naacp and sisterreach a womens rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the south the president of sagaftra a union that represents actors singers and other entertainers also signed on the xpo warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to verizons stated policies and practices says the letter provided exclusively to huffpost on tuesday the letter notes that mcadam has been a vocal supporter of womens rights the ceo recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at makers a womens conference run by verizonowned oath oath is also huffposts parent company as community leaders and womens rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the times up and metoo campaigns and movements we are deeply concerned with how verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain the letter says the writers ask for a meeting with verizon to further discuss the situation huffpost alerted verizon to the letter on tuesday night the company said this was the first it heard about the situation in memphis we are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter verizon spokesman bob varettoni told huffpost on wednesday after looking at the charges later that day lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations according to a letter sent to xpo from verizon broadly outlining their discussion and next steps these are very disturbing and serious allegations verizons attorneys write verizon expects xpo logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor xpos actions the updates and investigation will inform the basis of any decisions verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with xpo the letter was addressed to two xpo executives including inhouse lawyer richard valitutto according to the harassment charges valitutto was also employed by the warehouses previous owners new breed logistics when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010 the company lost that case and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues its not clear what happened after that a spokesman for xpo declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early april and had not yet seen the late april filings our culture promotes safety and respect we have no tolerance for any form of harassment an xpo spokesman told huffpost we promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention the charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors its a struggle thats somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas other tech firms including facebook do hold their contractors to various standards including minimum wages and benefits requirements many including verizon say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the me too movement matures its possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements where bigname companies outsource labor needs to us companies with a far lower profile part of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment said emily martin general counsel at the national womens law center which has signed on to the letter companies like verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella she said they have a lot of power to make change verizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice said martin who also oversees some legal work for times up the antiharassment initiative created by women in hollywood in the wake of the me too movement the women who filed these claims are hourly workers who dont earn a lot of money and many are the sole breadwinners for their family grateful for the hourly work and fulltime benefits despite the hazards of the job said gloria sweetlove president of the naacp in tennessee which signed the letter the racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss as the female workers at the plant are mainly african american and their supervisors mostly white men according to the letter from the groups one woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him calling one his chocolate baby theyre getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the south got for generations said sweetlove who noted shes met with many workers inside the xpo facility where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours desperate to hang on to the fulltime work that comes with benefits a rarity for lowwage workers in memphis these eight women are just the tip of the iceberg there are so many more everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked she said the facilitys previous owner new breed logistics was sued by the eeoc in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in memphis a jury found in favor of the victims with a 15 million judgment a federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward however while the case was on appeal xpo bought the facility verizon contracted with new breed as well according to the lawyer who filed the current crop of charges xpo continues to employ executives who were there when the last suit was filed including its human resources director and corporate counsel valitutto this article has been updated with details of verizons letter to xpo have you experienced sexual harassment or discrimination where you work huffpost

firms share cyber secrets with russia', body='by joel schectman dustin volz and jack stubbs western technology companies including cisco ibm and sap are acceding to demands by moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets at a time when russia has been accused of a growing number of cyber attacks on the west a reuters investigation has found russian authorities are asking western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls antivirus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country the requests which have increased since 2014 are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any backdoors that would allow them to burrow into russian systems but those inspections also provide the russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products source code instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment current and former us officials and security experts said while a number of us firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to russias huge tech market at least one us firm symantec told reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns that halt has not been previously reported symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the russian government us officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the russians to review their products source code because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks but they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates us sanctions from their side companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market the companies say they only allow russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered graphic on source code review process tmsnrtrs2szudwt the demands are being made by russias federal security service fsb which the us government says took part in the cyber attacks on hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million yahoo email accounts the fsb which has denied involvement in both the election and yahoo hacks doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in russia the reviews are also conducted by the federal service for technical and export control fstec a russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets records published by fstec and reviewed by reuters show that from 1996 to 2013 it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from western companies in the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews a kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the fsb the fsb did not respond to requests for comment fstec said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice the us state department declined to comment moscows source code requests have mushroomed in scope since usrussia relations went into a tailspin following the russian annexation of crimea in 2014 according to eight current and former us officials four company executives three us trade attorneys and russian regulatory documents in addition to ibm cisco and germanys sap hewlett packard enterprise co and mcafee have also allowed russia to conduct source code reviews of their products according to people familiar with the companies interactions with moscow and russian regulatory records until now little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry the fstec documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense pushandpull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking roszel thomsen an attorney who helps us tech companies navigate russia import laws said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to russian security services against possible lost sales some companies do refuse he said others look at the potential market and take the risk if tech firms do decline the fsbs source code requests then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright us trade attorneys and us officials said the russian information technology market is expected to be worth 184 billion this year according to market researcher international data corporation idc six current and former us officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about russias motives for the expanded reviews its something we have a real concern about said a former senior commerce department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between us companies and russian officials until he left office this year you have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit and thats obviously a real problem however none of the officials who spoke to reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process source code requests are not unique to russia in the united states tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work china sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software us trade attorneys say the reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as clean rooms several of the russian companies that conduct the testing for western tech companies on behalf of russian regulators have current or previous links to the russian military according to their websites echelon a moscowbased technology testing company is one of several independent fsbaccredited testing centers that western companies can hire to help obtain fsb approval for their products echelon ceo alexey markov told reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories controlled by the companies where no software data can be altered or transferred markov said echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with russias military and law enforcement authorities echelons website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by russias ministry of defense for protection of state secrets the companys website also sometimes refers to markov as the head of attestation center of the ministry of defense in an email markov said that title is only intended to convey echelons role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing the medals were generic and insignificant he said but for symantec the lab didnt meet our bar for independence said spokeswoman kristen batch in the case of russia we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in russia said batch who added that the company did not believe russia had tried to hack into its products in 2016 the company decided it would no longer use third parties including echelon that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from governmentmandated security testing it poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept she said without the source code approval symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its businessoriented security products in russia as a result we do minimal business there she said markov declined to comment on symantecs decision citing a nondisclosure agreement with the company over the past year hp has used echelon to allow fstec to review source code according to the agencys records a company spokesman declined to comment an ibm spokesman confirmed the company allows russia to review its source code in secure companycontrolled facilities where strict procedures are followed fstec certification records showed the information security center an independent testing company based outside moscow has reviewed ibms source code on behalf of the agency the

facility in germany according to a person familiar with the process in a company statement sap said the review process assures russian customers their sap software investments are safe and secure cisco has recently allowed russia to review source code according to a person familiar with the matter a cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the companys interactions with russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in trusted independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products before allowing the

driverless car kill or save', body='people cant make up their moral minds about driverless cars in a series of surveys published thursday in the journal science researchers asked people what they believe a driverless car ought to do in the following scenario a group of pedestrians are crossing the street and the only way the car can avoid hitting them is by swerving off the road which would kill the passengers inside the participants generally agreed that the cars should be programmed to sacrifice their passengers if doing so would save many other people this broadly speaking is a utilitarian kind of answer one aimed at preserving the greatest possible number of lives but theres one problem the people in the survey also said they wouldnt want to ride in these cars themselves it would be ok for others to buy them the participants said but they personally would not figuring out how to build ethical autonomous machines is one of the thorniest challenges in artificial intelligence today jeanfrancois bonnefon of frances institute for advanced study in toulouse and his colleagues wrote in the study the scenario described above is hypothetical but it and others like it are bound to happen in real life once driverless cars become a mainstream reality the researchers said we need answers and rules now so that we can include them in the programming of these machines even if a driverless car has a manual override option its easy to imagine a situation where there simply isnt time for a passenger to react and take control of the vehicle it can be unnerving to think about this stuff but autonomous vehicles actually have the potential to create a safer world in the united states alone about 35000 traffic deaths occur every year along with millions of injuries around 90 percent of those accidents are due to human error azim shariff an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the university of california irvine and a coauthor of the study said at a press conference autonomous vehicles promise to change all that for the better but there are barriers to their wide adoption a number of those are technological barriers but theyre also psychological ones if youve ever taken an ethics class you might recognize the driverlesscar scenario described above it shares a lot of dna with a famous thought experiment known as the trolley problem in that scenario you are the engineer of a runaway trolley on the track ahead of you five workers are working oblivious to your approach you cant brake but you can switch the trolley onto another track but theres one person on that track would you kill that one worker to save five others there are a number of variations on the question what if that one person is pregnant what if the five others are criminals you can imagine how many different ways this can go for the study published thursday the researchers conducted six online surveys of us residents between june and november 2015 asking participants how they would want their autonomous cars to behave in various scenarios the researchers tweaked some variables such as the number of pedestrians or passengers in each scenario in some examples participants had to imagine their child was riding in the car in others they were told to imagine riding with their coworkers people generally preferred decisions that minimized the number of casualties in one scenario 76 percent of respondents said it would be more moral for an autonomous vehicle to sacrifice one passenger if it would save 10 pedestrians but this allegiance to the greater good only went so far people balked when asked if they would purchase these cars themselves you can recognize the feeling bonnefon said its the feeling that i want other people to do something but it would be great not to do it myself what should the manufacturers of driverless cars do and what would happen to public safety if every driverless car was programmed to protect its passengers above all else to maximize safety people want to live in a world in which everybody owns driverless cars that minimize casualties but they want their own car to protect them at all costs said iyad rahwan a researcher at mit and coauthor of the study automakers that offer such cars would probably make a lot of money rahwan said but its the tragedy of the commons if everybody thinks this way then we will end up in a world in which every car will look after its own passengers safety and society as a whole is worse off however the researchers believe that public attitudes may change over time if the technology of autonomous cars improves to the point where riding in them is ultimately safer than driving yourself people might become more receptive to the idea of buying a car that increases their safety even if its explicitly programmed to allow them to die in certain unlikely situations if you have opinions of your own you can contribute to the discussion at this

according to people familiar with the matter the 69 billion deal will be this years largest corporate acquisition it will combine one of the nations largest pharmacy benefits managers pbms and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers whose farreaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide according to the agreed terms aetna shareholders stand to receive 145 per share in cash and 08378 cvs health shares for each aetna share the sources said the companies will announce the deal later on sunday the four sources added aetna shareholders will own about 22 percent of the combined company while cvs shareholders will own the remainder the sources said three aetna directors including aetnas chairman and ceo mark bertolini will join cvss board of directors the sources added the sources requested not to be identified because the deal has not yet been announced cvs and aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment the deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the affordable care act rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as amazoncom inc cvs plans to use its lowcost clinics to eventually save more than 1 billion per year on health care costs for aetnas roughly 23 million medical members sources have said a combined insurer and pbm will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices and the arrangement could boost sales for cvss frontofstore retail business the company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments that could eventually cut costs substantially with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits meanwhile deeper collaboration between aetnas insurance business and cvss pbm division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the pbms leverage with drugmakers independent pbms have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients aetna patient visits to cvs stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost frontofstore sales which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the affordable care act aetna last year tried to buy rival humana inc to gain leverage to control costs but us antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between anthem inc and cigna corp analysts have said the cvsaetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector megamergers as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy it could spur a merger between walgreens boots alliance inc and humana inc or between humana and walmart stores inc ana gupte analyst at leerink partners said recently vertical merger although cvs and aetnas planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries the us department of justice has been taking a closer look at socalled vertical mergers where the companies are not direct competitors last month the justice department sued to block att incs planned 854 billion merger with time warner inc saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice the cvsaetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other pbms several investors said asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press but four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off it is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the us federal trade commission or the justice department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy said matthew cantor of law firm constantine cannon the companies want the ftc to get it the reason that the ftc is better at this point is that the justice department has

have reimbursed a 130000 payment cohen made to daniels as hush money to keep her from discussing her alleged 2006 affair with trump according to a sevenpage summary of avenattis firms claims the payments were sent within approximately 75 days of the payment to daniels aka stephanie clifford avenattis documents did not provide any sources as to how he obtained that information but he told

it made payments to essential consulting in accordance with a oneyear contract that began in february 2017 the company paid out a total of 12 million it said not 400000 as avenatti reported the

laughing alone with tablets and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks the models in all these examples are usually white and extremely

known for reinforcing especially as a new crop of stock photo startups focus exclusively on diverse images giants like getty started with tackling female stereotypes teaming up with sheryl sandberg in 2014 to create the lean in collection which shows women working in labs and hiking no romaine lettuce in sight now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of masculinity undone getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows launched in january the photos include men of color men with long hair and men who are shirtless despite lacking welldefined pecs and biceps were trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side guy merrill gettys global head of art told huffpost were breaking away from stereotypes the business leader the absent father and buffoon the lonely guy who doesnt need any friends or community shutterstock has created a modern man collection full of male nurses gay couples and guys who love to garden while adobe is showcasing the fluid self which includes photos of men wearing makeup earrings and dressed in drag as well as portraits of the transgender community the shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to be a man theres been a backlash against the type of aggressive authoritative manliness embodied by president donald trump and white nationalists along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates todays hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor think timothee chalamet and harry styles jayz talks openly about being in therapy jaden smith wears dresses and in every episode of

are taught to suppress is it ok to be skinny is it ok to be depressed and lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength stock photo companies say data client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity in the past few years getty searches for man meditation went up by 126 percent man looking worried by 100 percent and gay dads by 53 percent according to the company a recent shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of us marketers think its important to use images that reflect modern day society younger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity said robyn lange shutterstocks curator theres no longer buckets you place these genders into its more of a spectrum in theory stock photography is wellpoised to help people think more progressively about gender these images are ubiquitous appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans travel to hawaii and whiten our teeth people arent aware of how much stock theyre seeing every day everywhere on every platform said brenda mills adobes principal of creative services and visual trends and so it has a huge influence over peoples lives raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally female jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity rather than effeminate anomalies part of what we need are images to help us create a new reality said tristan bridges an assistant sociology professor at the university of california santa barbara what would it look like if men and women didnt have to wear different types of clothes or we didnt have to imagine them in different types of jobs but giorgia aiello an associate media and communication professor at the university of leeds in england who studies stock photos sees these diversity collections as branding exercises a way to appear cutting edge rather than to truly change gender norms although getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography in the end the bottom line is purely commercial she said in some ways it is good they are doing it but its certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images getty and shutterstock both have more than 200000 contributors ranging from iphone amateurs to professionals who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed while companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want more men sitting in half lotus please once contributors have been accepted onto the platform they can upload whatever images they choose so long as they arent offensive or illegal gettys lean in collection for example represents just 001 percent of the companys more than 190 million images if someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad despite all the memes we cant stop them said merrill though he noted that getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on masculinity undonethemed shoots stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos in 2007 gettys topselling image for the search term woman was a halfnaked woman lying on a bed now its a woman hiking a rocky trail but aiello said that doesnt necessarily equal progress she has found that photos from the lean in collection most often appeared in lightweight lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination quite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism she said but in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science while its possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics adobes mills doesnt think thats a problem her fashion and grooming clients currently have the biggest appetite for nonstereotypical images of men she said because those photos help them reach a new market but more companies have begun to show interest im surprised by some of the clients who i thought might be more conservative being incredibly open to this fluid self trend mills said theyre actually incredibly hungry for it gettys merrill said that even if his customers arent begging for more nuanced photos of men his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction its not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want we also want to repicture cliches for them he said this is where we need to be in a year or two our customers might not be there yet but we know they are going to be and we want to make sure they have

state killer was a cop', body='washington there were reasons to suspect the serial murderer and rapist known as the golden state killer worked as a cop he knew to conceal his identity wearing ski masks and gloves ordering his victims not to look at him disguising his voice in a whisper he meticulously cased victims neighborhoods and homes emptying bullets from a gun disrupting phone lines reducing noise he brought shoelaces and ropes to use as makeshift handcuffs he had a knack for parking outside of a police perimeter he was proficient with firearms tactically sound and skilled at making his victims comply an escaping woman once heard him shout freeze and for decades he managed to escape authorities as it turns out joseph james deangelo the 72yearold man arrested last week on suspicion of committing a chain of rapes murders and burglaries in california in the 1970s and 80s was an expolice officer he also reportedly served in the navy during the vietnam war deangelo hasnt entered a plea yet and his attorney emphasized that he is innocent until proven guilty but if deangelo is the golden state killer his background matters being in law enforcement could have helped him further his alleged crimes and although this case is extreme deangelo may have only been interested in policing to get away with wrongdoing theres dramatic evidence that when a person with abusive tendencies joins a police force the tools and authority that come with being a cop may only make them more dangerous with his training in law enforcement he would absolutely look to try to use that to his advantage john hall the police chief at exeter police department where deangelo worked decades ago told huffpost most people enter law enforcement because they believe its a very noble and honorable profession and they have a genuine desire to go out and make a positive difference hall added so when you have somebody that comes on board and they betray that trust that was placed in them its just extremely disappointing deangelo graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in criminal justice from california state university sacramento in 1972 he did an internship in patrol identification and investigation divisions according to a 1973 exeter sun article that reported he joined exeter police department in may that year hall told huffpost he had no doubt deangelo worked there though there are no employee records from that time deangelo then went on to work at the auburn police department from 1976 to 1979 according to news reports until he was fired after stealing a hammer and a can of dog repellent the auburn police department did not respond to a request to verify that timeline deangelo would have been with the exeter police when a spree of highprofile burglaries took place in nearby visalia in the mid70s those crimes have not yet been officially linked to him but he also appears to have been with the auburn police when a string of rapes occurred not far from that area deangelos public defender did not respond to a request for comment only around 1 percent of serial killers have a law enforcement background not counting security guards out of the 5009 serial killers in the radfordfgcu serial killer database the largest nongovernmental serial murderer database in the world 32 were former members of law enforcement and 25 were in law enforcement for at least part of their series of murders according to michael aamodt a professor emeritus at radford university in virginia two other serial killers were exmilitary police and 44 were security guards deangelo was an officer in sleepy communities decades ago and its unclear how much serious policing he did he reportedly caught a toiletpapering teenager and the police department in auburn mostly handled property crimes but law enforcement experience might help a killer to conduct surveillance physically and verbally force a victim to comply and conceal evidence today police officers have access to sophisticated information databases but even in the 70s deangelo may have been able to view information disseminated about his alleged crimes its unknown if he did so additionally once someone works as a cop that experience and those instincts can become deeply ingrained investigators had suspected that the golden state killer could be a police officer andor have a military background said larry pool a former investigator with the orange county sheriffs department who spent more than 20 years working on the case pool personally believed that our offender would be someone who while needing to control people would not be very good at controlling themselves and he suspected the offender wouldnt be successful for long in those careers nonetheless pool said he wouldnt have excluded somebody who was very successful in the military or law enforcement pool documented names of police officers detectives and emergency personnel who touched the case and followed up on them to determine what theyd done since the series of crimes he noted in his view deangelo was not a real police officer but someone who came into law enforcement wanting to be placed in a position of control and authority he told huffpost hes always been a wolf in sheeps clothing policing experts say vigilant screening and oversight can be key to making sure a violent person stays out of a police force law enforcement agencies do a pretty good job now of screening for violenttype tendencies said david thomas a program manager for the international association of chiefs of police who focuses on addressing violence against women but for anyone looking to bolster their hiring practices i would want to do a case study on everything that they can connected to the deangelo case to learn from it screening is not infallible so when victims report officer abuse to internal affairs departments for example those complaints must be taken seriously victim advocates say a huffpost investigation on officerinvolved domestic violence found that even minorsounding complaints can reflect deeper problems although the golden state killer is an extreme case and the crimes took place decades ago keeping forces free of bad apples is just as important today particularly as communities of color continue to distrust police and may feel that badly behaving officers are protected rather than held accountable police have tremendous authority and they get information and access that simply isnt available to most people said seth stoughton an assistant professor of law at the university of south carolina and a former police officer there are plenty of concerns that arise from the risk that officers will slightly misuse their knowledge and authority and what this guy did was not a slight misuse nick willick the former auburn police chief who fired deangelo decades ago for shoplifting told fox40 he was personally embarrassed that his excolleague had turned out to be the alleged killer its a black eye willick

body='president trump believes that federal regulation is excessive and has directed that task forces be set up at each federal agency to supervise and monitor the process of finding regulations to cut to my knowledge he has not provided any guidance to the agencies on how to do this so i decided to do it for him in this article step 1 define the objective counting the number of regulations is useless what matters is whether the objectives of regulation are being achieved regulation is excessive when it does not accomplish its objective or when the cost of accomplishing the objective through regulation is excessive or when there is an alternative to regulation that is less costly the objectives vary from agency to agency my interest is in financial regulation this includes the market for home mortgages which i will use for my illustrations the agencies with regulatory responsibilities in this market include hudfha the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the federal housing finance agency fannie mae and freddie mac i will illustrate with two objectives both of which are designed to empower the little guy 1 reduce barriers to effective mortgage shopping 2 reduce mortgage transactions costs step 2 identify remediable deficiencies the major focus of the agencies in assessing their regulations should be to identify the major deficiencies that are preventing their objectives from being realized for the mortgagerelated agencies step 2 would include the following deficiencies bearing on the two objectives cited above 1 lender control of appraisals makes them nonportable and lengthens transaction periods both of which impede the ability of borrowers to shop effectively 2 the cost of title insurance paid by borrowers is excessive relative to the costs incurred in assessing the validity of titles step 3 assess existing and alternative regulations i will illustrate with the two objectives and deficiencies cited above the difficulty in shopping the core problem potential borrowers face in shopping for a mortgage is that critically important information bearing on its price including the value of the property is not available to them until after they have applied for a loan and paid for an appraisal for a borrower to withdraw at this point in order to begin again with another lender is difficult costly and timeconsuming so few do it relevant existing regulations the regulations applicable to appraisals are a major source of the problem while borrowers pay for appraisals the regulations place responsibility and control with lenders who order them after a borrower has applied this lengthens the period the borrower must wait for the information needed to shop and it also means that the borrower who withdraws from the process must pay for a new appraisal and wait out the results once again a better regulatory approach if regulations obliged lenders to accept an appraisal ordered by a borrower from any approved appraisal management company the borrower would at last have the capacity to shop for the best deal with an appraisal in hand the shopper could invite multiple lenders to make a firm offer at a specified date and time making appraisals portable is one of the simplest and most effective ways to empower consumers bringing that about would require replacement of one set of regulations with another set the excessive price of title insurance assuring good title is necessary for an effective housing and mortgage market but title insurance is not necessary for that purpose denmark has a reliable system of recording titles but no title insurance relevant existing law existing law allows lenders to shift to the borrower the cost of title insurance that protects the lender this prevents the efficient application of existing technology that would reduce the cost of assuring good titles to a small fraction of the cost of title insurance the problem is that lenders have no financial incentive to shift to a more efficient system in fact many have a financial interest in the title agencies to which they refer customers a better regulatory approach if the law required lenders to pay for title insurance themselves passing the cost to the borrower in the price of the mortgage lenders would have an incentive to drive down the cost rather than to share in the revenue the result would be a precipitous decline in the cost of title insurance and eventually the replacement of the industry with an automated system open to all market participants if this new and very simple regulation applied to mortgage insurance as well as title insurance which should be the case it would make a large set of existing regulations obsolete these are the regulations that apply to referral fees which deal with such weighty matters as whether a birthday present from a title agent or a mortgage insurance salesperson to a lender constitutes a prohibited referral fee good riddance concluding comment the president says he wants to reduce the number of regulations i interpret that to mean that he wants to replace regulations that are directed toward worthy objectives but dont work with regulations that do work and i have given some examples regulations that ought to be scrapped rather than replaced will be discussed in another article for more information on mortgages or to shop for a mortgage in an unbiased environment visit my website the mortgage professor'}.
