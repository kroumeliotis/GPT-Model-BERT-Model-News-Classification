Without some focus on these concepts, we might risk taking actions that may protect the planet but are incompatible with human well-being -- or vice versa.\u00a0Any large-scale measures taken to protect the environment that do not promote equality, for instance,\u00a0are unlikely to be successful in the long run, the paper's authors explain.\u00a0 \"Lasting sustainability will hinge on fair and just solutions,\" Hicks said in a statement.\u00a0 In creating these solutions, the paper's authors argue that we need to bring together the expertise of many disciplines -- including psychology, sociology, economics and other social sciences.\u00a0 \"We are really beginning to recognize what an important role social science has to play when it comes to climate change and ecological destruction,\" Hicks said. \"Whereas there is solid scientific agreement on what needs to happen, we are struggling when it comes to how we should get there. ... Social science can help us understand how and why we have gotten into the situation we are in, how people are likely to respond to changes in the near and long term future, and why in the face of so much evidence there is still inaction.\" Here's an example of how social science can inform sustainable solutions: A two-year anthropology project examined and tracked the progress of wild food practices as part of Seattle's Urban Forest Stewardship Plan.\u00a0 \"The Forest Commission consulted the research and determined that urban wildlands have diverse values for people,\" paper co-author Melissa Poe, a social science liaison with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Washington Sea Grant, told HuffPost, noting that the study resulted in changes that made the program more effective.\u00a0 And in terms of inequality, social indicators have been used to identify \"climate equity hotspots,\" where risk factors like poverty, poor education and low access were used to isolate communities that are disproportionately vulnerable to climate risks, according to Poe.\u00a0 The new paper is part of a growing movement to bring the insights of social science into the fight against climate change. Creating a sustainable future is a challenge with emotional, moral and psychological dimensions, and behavioral scientists are now taking action to better understand the complex relationship between humans and nature.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a very new terrain we\u2019re in,\u201d said Dr. Renee Lertzman, a San Francisco-based psychosocial researcher whose work focuses on promoting climate change action\u00a0in organizational settings, told HuffPost in a previous article. \u201cThat\u2019s the exciting part \u2026 It\u2019s very innovative and it\u2019s very emerging. But we have to get to the point where we really can be open to new and different ways of looking at things.\u201d\u00a0 Hicks agreed that it's time to take risks, build respect and merge disciplines to come up with new solutions to the global ecological crisis.\u00a0 \"We need to be bold and step outside our comfort zones to develop methods for assessing complex concepts that can be communicated and heard across disciplines and at a variety of policy scales,\" she said. \"We need to consider different forms of knowledge, try understanding familiar things in different ways and let this form the basis for sustained dialogue and debate about how sustainability is understood.\"'}.

This insidious byproduct of petroleum has infiltrated the marine food webs and Earthlings are indeed in harms way. It wasn't until World War II that polyethylene (plastic single-use disposable bags, dispensable bottles), propylene (bottle caps, fishing gear) and polystyrene (take-away food containers) were invented, and by the late 1960s being mass-produced. By 1979, the production of plastics in the U.S. eclipsed that of steel. Today, globally humans produce 280 million metric tons of plastic, annually. Plastics are long chains of monomer hydrocarbon molecules. And one of the principle ingredients of all plastics is crude oil. How much? Four percent of the entire world supply or about 3.4 million barrels of oil, each day, are used to make them.  Earth's oceans are choking with plastics. It is incomprehensible that each day an additional 3.5 million pieces of plastic enter our oceans or 18 million metric tons of plastic each year. Two summers ago researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Superior discovered that Lakes' Superior, Huron and Erie were crammed with plastic and smaller micro pieces of plastics dubbed 'micro-plastics.' This past summer (2013) they confirmed that both Lakes' Michigan and Ontario were also brimming with micro-plastics. It turns out that the sources are abrasive plastics or micro-beads containing tiny bits of polyethylene plastics used in exfoliants, in face soaps, body washes, toothpastes and other personal care and household products. The particles are so small about the size of one sand grain; they slip through the screens at the wastewater treatment plants and then accumulate en masse in the Great Lakes. Scientists know that both plastics and micro-plastics act as chemical sponges attracting toxins dissolved in water. The Great Lakes micro-plastics' are rife with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenol A (BP As), phalates, dioxins and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), which are all known to disrupt the human endocrine system and cause cancers and birth defects. Moreover, fish consume these micro-plastics mistaking them for food sources and these toxins are bio-magnified up the food web ultimately poisoning humans who consume fish. In addition many large cities draw their drinking water directly from the Great Lakes. The octillion pieces of plastic and micro-plastics in the Great Lakes can also act as a vector for alien species and diseases like the Vibrio bacteria that causes the pandemic cholera. Sadly, my favorite lake in Switzerland Lake Geneva is also full of plastics. And last week scientists from the University of Bayreuth in Germany found that Italy's largest lake: Lake Garda located high in the spectacular Italian Alps has 1,000 particles of plastic per square meter and 450 pieces of micro-plastics per square meter. Clearly Lake Garda's drinking water has been contaminated. Furthermore, European scientists now suspect that lakes in Bavaria mirror this micro-plastic pollution, which is not only thought to now be European-wide but worldwide. What can each of us do? Refuse to use or accept single-use disposable plastic bags. Refuse to use products that contain plastic ingredients. Please avoid buying beauty or health products that contain polypropylene or polyethylene. If each of us joins together and refuses to buy these products that are poisoning life on  Earth -- our purchasing power globally will send a clear message to the manufactures and distributors to stop making these deadly micro-plastic sponges. Please help protect our fresh waterways from pernicious petroleum-based plastics - now! Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist, educator and co-author of Life, The Wonder of it All. \n'}.

Like the rest of Europe, Italians in recent years have embraced the U.S. tradition of Black Friday, a day of heavy discounting by retailers on the day after Thanksgiving. Unions said in a statement more than 500 Amazon workers at the Piacenza site in northern Italy had agreed to strike following a failure to negotiate bonuses with the company. Workers have also decided not to do any overtime until Dec. 31, covering the peak season for the online retailer which hires temporary workers during this period. Amazon employs around 1,600 people on a permanent basis at the Piacenza site, the first it built in the country after launching its Italian website in 2010.

In a report and summary of response plans on its website on Thursday, Facebook describes well-funded and subtle efforts by nations and other organizations to spread misleading information and falsehoods for geopolitical goals. These initiatives go much further than posting fake news stories to include amplification - essentially widening the circulation of posts through a variety of means - carried out by government employees or paid professionals, often using fake accounts. Reuters reviewed an advance copy of the 13-page report, which was written by two veteran security analysts who joined Facebook from cyber security firms FireEye Inc and Dell SecureWorks, along with Facebook\u2019s chief security officer. Facebook said its security team would now fight information operations, which it regards as a more complex problem than traditional hackers and scammers, by suspending or deleting false accounts after identifying them with a combination of machine learning and intelligence agency-level analysis. The new efforts build on the company\u2019s recently expanded campaigns to identify fake news and crack down on automated profile pages that post commercial or political spam. Facebook suspended 30,000 accounts in France ahead of last Sunday\u2019s first-round presidential election. In addressing the U.S. presidential election as a \u201ccase study,\u201d the Facebook team said fake Facebook personas had spread stolen emails and other documents as part of a coordinated effort, which U.S. intelligence agencies have attributed to Russia. Other false personas pushed stories that expanded on that material. \u201cFrom there, organic proliferation of the messaging and data through authentic peer groups and networks was inevitable,\u201d Facebook said. It said its data \u201cdoes not contradict\u201d the U.S. director of national intelligence\u2019s conclusion that Russia was behind efforts to interfere with the U.S. election. The report does not name any other countries. Facebook has faced pressure to clamp down on fake news, and has begun warning about suspected hoax stories. In its latest report, Facebook focused on how it will fight \u201cfalse amplification\u201d and targeted data collection, carried out through methods such as imposter accounts and password-collection schemes. Facebook employees said the information operations it had seen included techniques such as carefully crafted friend requests sent under the appropriated names of real people. If those requests are accepted, the false friends can glean more information about the target. That information in turn can be used to send convincing web links leading to malicious software or to map the social networks of the targets for further spying. Facebook said it would go after amplifier accounts based on behavioral analysis that shows signs of inauthenticity, such as sudden bursts of activity or repeated posting of the same material, without regard to the politics of the content. Facebook said that other amplification techniques it had discovered include coordinated \u201clikes\u201d to boost the prominence of key postings, the creation of groups that camouflage propaganda by including legitimate items, and the spread of inflammatory and racist material. Most of the false amplification is driven by people with local language skills and a basic knowledge of the relevant political situation, the study said. Though the goals may often be to promote one cause or candidate or to denigrate another, another objective appears to be sowing distrust and confusion in general, the authors wrote. In some cases, they said, the same fake accounts engaged with both sides of an issue \u201cwith the apparent intent of increasing tensions between supporters.\u201d Facebook\u2019s new crackdown reflects a striking change in perspective from November, when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the argument that fake stories on Facebook could have influenced the U.S. presidential election \u201cin any way\u201d as \u201ca pretty crazy idea.\u201d \u00a0 (Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Bill Rigby and Grant McCool)'}.

The scientists stripped donor hearts of any cells that might cause recipients to reject them and then used stem cells to\u00a0rebuild the tissue. A study detailing the process sheds light on several key elements of bioengineering human heart muscle, said Dr.\u00a0Harald C. Ott.\u00a0He is an assistant professor in surgery at the hospital and a senior author of the study, which was published\u00a0in the journal Circulation Research\u00a0in the fall.\u00a0 \"While limited in force, these were the first (tiny) beats of a newly formed, human stem cell derived heart,\" Ott wrote last week in an email to The Huffington Post. Scientists still have a ways to go until they can bioengineer whole functional hearts for patients, he added. Ideally, however, they one day might be able to grow an entire organ using the donee's own cells and tissue. \"As with many developments, time is a factor determined by funding, man and brain power,\" Ott said. \"Our study shows that it is in theory possible, but much work remains to be done. As a first step, I do believe that parts of human hearts will become available sooner than whole heart grafts, and we are actively pursuing this option.\" Having that option would be life-saving, as there are 4,153 people across the U.S. who need a heart transplant -- and last year, about 402 people died while on the waiting list for one, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. The study involved 73 human hearts that had been donated through the New England Organ Bank. They weren't suitable for transplantation but could be used for research purposes. The scientists used a detergent solution to strip away the hearts' incompatible cells, leaving behind cardiac \"scaffolds.\" Next, they turned adult skin cells into pluripotent stem cells, which can be transformed into any other cell found in the human body. The researchers induced the pluripotent cells to become cardiac muscle cells and then repopulated the remaining \"scaffolds\"\u00a0with the new cells. They mounted the hearts in an automated bioreactor system (see photo above) that added nutrients to the organs and applied certain stressors to them --\u00a0conditions similar to those experienced by a real, living heart. After 14 days, the hearts resembled normal,\u00a0immature organs and even responded to electrical stimulation. Dr.\u00a0Jacques Guyette, a postdoctoral research fellow at the hospital and lead author of the study, said in a statement\u00a0that the researchers are planning to improve their methods even more. \"Regenerating a whole heart is most certainly a long-term goal that is several years away, so we are currently working on engineering a functional myocardial patch that could replace cardiac tissue damaged due [to] a heart attack or heart failure,\" he said. This technique is one of several being studied in hopes of someday\u00a0providing patients with transplants that won't be rejected, Fast Company reported. It also validates the feasibility of using human pluripotent stem cells in the future, said Dr. Young-sup Yoon, director of stem cell biology at the Emory University School of Medicine.\u00a0 \"Most definitely, sometime in the future we will be able to grow hearts, or at least heart tissue to offset the bottleneck,\" Yoon, who was not involved in the study, told HuffPost.\u00a0\"This study certainly provides a direction which may lead to such a future. ...

Russians have been competing as neutral athletes at the Games, their Olympic status suspended, as IOC punishment for years of drug scandals involving allegations that Russia ran a systematic, state-backed drug-cheating program. The IOC said two Russian doping violations during the Pyeongchang Games had marred an otherwise clean report card for the Russian delegation at the Games. \u201cThis was hugely disappointing and, in addition to other considerations, prevented the IOC from even considering lifting the suspension for the closing ceremony,\u201d IOC President Thomas Bach said in presenting the recommendation to IOC members. Bach said Russia\u2019s Olympic status would be restored automatically once it was confirmed there were no other doping violations by Russian athletes at Pyeongchang. It does not require any further decision by the IOC. \u201cThat is an automatic decision,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is an objective condition ... and then the sanction is lifted.\u201d The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days. \u201cWe hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIn light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.\u201d Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed,\u201d said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation. \u201cSome athletes stayed behind later with the hope that they would be walking under the Russian flag. I\u2019ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.\u201d Former Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it would be hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag if they won the ice hockey gold medal in their final against Germany later on Sunday. \u201cTime needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,\u201d the Russian said. \u201cIt is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It\u2019s sad. \u2018DROWNING MAN\u2019 Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medalist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologizing for the two doping violations during the Games. Medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results. The lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped expose the drugs scandal, said \u201ccooler heads\u201d at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia\u2019s immediate Olympic return. Rodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States. \u201cThomas Bach was a drowning man, but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,\u201d Jim Walden said in a statement. \u201cYet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia \u2018respected\u2019 its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach\u2019s mismanagement should be his undoing,\u201d Walden said. At the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations. Russian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday night\u2019s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals. In December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia\u2019s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.

When Hillary Clinton alleged he did not pay federal income taxes for years, he responded, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was less upfront about tax collection in his confirmation hearings. Secretary Mnuchin confirmed his awareness of the consequences of budget cuts to the IRS on revenue collection during his confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee, noting in his prepared remarks, \u201cit is likely that further cuts to the IRS will indeed hamper our ability to collect revenue.\u201d During the testimony, Mnuchin took his comments for the record one step further, adding, \u201cI can assure you that the president-elect understands the concept of \u2018we add people, we make money,\u2019\u2009[\u2026] That\u2019s a very quick conversation with Donald Trump.\u201d Studies of IRS revenue collection agree strongly with the Treasury Secretary on the opportunity to increase collection by funding enforcement initiatives. Indeed, already low-hanging fruit, in the form of additional government revenue collection, is increasingly within reach: in 2016 the collection of $100 of revenue cost only 35 cents, down from 53 cents in 2010, according to the IRS 2016 Data Book. Years of consecutive budget cuts to the IRS have reduced agency staff by 17 percent since 2010. Despite Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s assurances and the CBO\u2019s 2016 estimated return of between $1.20 and $9.00 per dollar of investment in various IRS enforcement initiatives, the President\u2019s latest budget proposal would cut IRS funding by $239 million. The largest parts of that cut of approximately two percent\u00a0(likely equivalent to more than 3.5 percent after adjusting for inflation) are directed towards enforcement. Efforts to weaken rather than bolster the IRS present challenges to an already under-resourced agency, and opportunity to those who seek to find \u201csmart\u2019 ways to avoid paying their federal income taxes. Relative to the drastic funding cuts that IRS officials had feared, or to the cuts proposed for some agencies and programs (for example, a 31.4 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency and a 40 percent cut to job training programs), the IRS may seem comparatively unscathed. However, as discussed above, the relationship between funding and expense is different for the IRS. As noted by current IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, \u201cessentially, the government is losing billions to achieve budget savings of a few hundred million dollars.\u201d If further weakening of IRS funding doesn\u2019t do enough damage to the federal government\u2019s ability to collect revenue, an even more worrisome possibility looms. Commissioner Koskinen was appointed by President Obama. His last day in office is November 9th of this year \u2015 less than five months from now. Who will replace Koskinen? And will the replacement be someone who survives a Senate confirmation process in which Trump\u2019s hidden tax returns and purported decades of audits becomes a major topic of discussion? Or instead will we witness the temporary appointment of an IRS director focused on aiding Trump and his allies rather than collecting revenue? Trump\u2019s selection of corporate lawyer Keith Noreika as acting director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has created a dangerous precedent, which could be used to severely hamper attempts at IRS modernization and enforcement. Noreika went directly from being a law firm partner to Acting Comptroller of the Currency. Would Trump appoint a Trump Organization Accountant to become Acting Commissioner of the IRS? Should the Trump administration place a non-confirmed acting director atop the IRS, an already-stacked deck would further favor the private-sector parties aiming to get around collection. Additionally, such an appointment would create an informational asymmetry, as after up to 130 days as agency head (or more, there\u2019s very little enforcement behind rules around acting appointees), the appointee could return to the private-sector with intimate knowledge of weaknesses in IRS enforcement. And in particular, that temporary head could make a big headache go away from one very influential person, hedge fund billionaire and Breitbart investor Robert Mercer. In a too-little noticed McClatchy piece last month, it was reported that \u201cThe Internal Revenue Service is demanding a whopping $7 billion or more in back taxes from the world\u2019s most profitable hedge fund, whose boss\u2019s wealth and cyber savvy helped Donald Trump pole-vault into the White House.\u201d The IRS demand is hardly controversial, as Mercer\u2019s Renaissance Technologies attempts to use an obviously problematic loophole to pretend that\u2019s its rapid-fire trading constitutes long term investing that is taxed at a far lower rate. Since polling suggests that wealthy individuals escaping their tax bill are more likely to be considered \u201cunpatriotic\u201d than \u201csmart,\u201d sticking a wrench in the gears of the IRS seems outright treasonous. So while continuing to monitor Trump-Russia, we need to also seek to limit the damage to the country from Trump\u2019s problematic and seemingly purposeful mismanagement of the IRS that even his own Treasury Secretary knows is wrong. And while we monitor the IRS\u2019 budget, we also need to be on the watch for a potentially catastrophic revolving door personnel pick to head the IRS after Koskinen\u2019s term expires in November.'}.

A pavilion is dedicated to the immersive technology, with virtual reality film screenings and discussions as part of the festival's tandem Marche du Film sessions. Among those showing virtual reality films -- all short productions for which viewers must don a headset -- is \"Madagascar\" co-director Eric Darnell, whose six-minute \"Invasion!\" tells the story of a mythical world invaded by aliens then outsmarted by a rabbit. \"It's not in my mind just an extension of cinema, it is its own thing and we have to discover so much about what are the tools in our toolbox,\" Darnell told Reuters. \"It really is just a brand new language.\" Another virtual reality film showing in Cannes is \"Giant\", whose director Milica Zec says the immersive experience means audiences can choose where they look and what they see. \"You have to think that now you have 360 degrees that you have to cover,\" she said. \"When you have a regular standard film, the screen is in front of you but here it feels like you're inside of the screen as a viewer.\" Zec and Darnell agree the technology still has a long way to go but virtual reality films will one day become the norm. However, not everyone is a fan. Director Steven Spielberg said such movies will \"take hold in a profound way\" but said it was \"a dangerous medium\". \"The only reason I say it is dangerous is because it gives the viewer a lot of latitude not to take direction from the storytellers but make their own choices of where to look,\" he said in an interview. \"I just hope it doesn't forget the story when it starts enveloping us in a world that we can see all around us and make our own choices of what to look at.\" In other signs that Cannes is embracing the new this year, it has also partly opened the door for streaming video giants, allowing Amazon to make its debut.

That's No Guarantee For Democrats.', body='America\u2019s electorate is growing more diverse. By the next presidential election, racial minorities will exceed 40 percent of the eligible electorate in six states, according to\u00a0a report released in April\u00a0by a consortium of think tanks.\u00a0By 2036, a dozen states will pass that mark. At the same time, the share of states whose electorates are more than four-fifths white is predicted to drop steadily, from 23 in the next presidential election to only 11 by the year 2036. Nationwide, white voters without a college education are expected to make up a dwindling \u2015 though still significant \u2015 share of the eligible electorate, dropping from 46 percent in the last presidential election to just 37 percent by the year 2036. The electorate is also aging, with voters above the age of 65 making up an increasing slice. The report, titled\u00a0\u201cStates of Change,\u201d\u00a0was produced the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Brookings Institution, PRRI and the progressive Center for American Progress. \u201cDemographics are not destiny,\u201d\u00a0authors Rob Griffin, Ruy Teixeira and William H. Frey write, \u201cbut steady and predictable changes to the electorate play an important role in defining the landscape of American elections.\u201d The impact these changes have at the polls in 2020 and future elections depends both on which groups actually turn out to vote and how strongly traits like race and education hold together as voting blocs.\u00a0 The report lays out more than 30 possible scenarios for upcoming elections. In several, voting patterns stay the same as in past elections, with the only change coming from the overall makeup of the electorate. Generally, as the electorate becomes more diverse, that would shift the momentum increasingly toward Democrats in future years. But especially in the short term, there\u2019s still room for variance. For instance, if the unusually high share of third-party voters in the last election \u201creturn home\u201d to their parties in the next presidential contest, but 2016\u2032s voting patterns are otherwise repeated by the 2020 electorate, the country could end with an Electoral College tie. In other scenarios, racial minorities begin to turn out at the same rate as white voters \u2015 also likely a boon for Democrats, unless minority groups begin shifting toward the GOP. In still other versions of the future, if white voters without college degrees swing further toward the GOP, the party could take a narrow popular vote victory and a comfortable Electoral College win. \u00a0 Republicans can find immediate success by targeting non-college-educated whites. But going forward, as that group shrinks, the party would eventually lose in the Electoral College. If the GOP doesn\u2019t also reach out to Hispanics and Asians, the report concludes, they \u201crisk putting themselves into a box where they become ever more dependent on a declining white population \u2014 particularly its older segment.\u201d Segments of the GOP expressed those very concerns prior to President Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Following Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 loss, the party\u2019s autopsy argued that Republicans needed to\u00a0reach out to minorities and women to survive. In 2015, discussing a previous year\u2019s report on demographic change,\u00a0a pollster for Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) argued that the party would need to attract a record percentage of minorities to win the presidency in 2016. In retrospect, that alarm looks premature. And as the most recent report finds, the GOP still has paths to victory that don\u2019t include a broader tent. The underlying demographic shifts, though, would seem to constrict the party\u2019s options going forward. \u201cTaken together, the States of Change projections for the Republican Party are reasonably dire,\u201d Sean Trende, a senior election analyst for RealClearPolitics, noted in a review of the scenarios included in the report. But he added later, \u201cSimply put, if demographics were the overwhelming factor that many suggest they are, then a candidate like Trump ought not to have been able to win in the least-white electorate on record. Yet he did win \u2014 and likely won in part as a reaction to these demographic changes.\u201d A number of the report\u2019s scenarios end with Republicans again winning the Electoral College while failing to capture the popular vote. Another split of that kind could be demotivating for voters, especially on the Democratic side, Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said at a recent panel discussing the report. Greenberg noted that she\u2019d heard from many young voters in post-election focus groups that they felt democratic participation was futile: \u201cIf you think your vote doesn\u2019t matter, then why go out and vote?\u201d\u00a0 The span of plausible scenarios in which a given party could pull off a presidential win also lays bare ongoing arguments within Democratic and Republican ranks about their parties\u2019 futures. For instance, it raises the question to what extent Democrats should focus on winning back white, non-college-educated voters\u00a0from the GOP, versus turning out young and minority voters who are already predisposed to vote Democratic but are\u00a0not guaranteed to show up at the ballot box. \u201cI\u2019ve always taken the view that political coalitions are like water balloons,\u201d Trende said at the same panel discussion. \u201cYou step down on one side and another side pops up. \u00a0And I think that is a real problem for the Democrats going forward. You can try to tend to various parts of the coalition, but inevitably, you have a message that dominates.\u201d Even as demographics seem to give Democrats a growing advantage, the report concludes, winning the Electoral College will likely require a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d\u00a0between the dual goals of \u201cintensifying their support among voters of color and improving their margins among white, particularly white non-college-educated, voters.\u201d \u201cIt really hits home the challenge for what the progressive narrative is for Democrats,\u201d Greenberg said, pointing to winning scenarios that wouldn\u2019t require the party to improve on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 numbers with working-class whites. \u201cYou can easily win in the future solely on the votes of minority voters, white college-educated [voters], especially women, and not ever talk to the white working class. ... So tactically, that\u2019s a fine strategy, but philosophically for the Democratic Party, not such a fine strategy.\u201d'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Other DNC officials, including at-large member Brian Wahby and Kansas Democratic National Committeeman Chris Reeves, welcomed an in-kind donation but stopped short of asking for it. \u201cIt would be a Christian thing to do,\u201d Wahby said. Sanders\u2019 office did not return a request for comment on whether the senator agrees.  Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, defended the price tag on Thursday on the grounds that the DNC has already reaped far more than it paid for the email list in fundraising so far. \u201cPaying a rental fee for use of an email list is common practice, and in this case the DNC has raised over $30 million with it, an 1,800 [percent] return on their investment,\u201d Merrill wrote in an email to Fox News. (The DNC purchased the email list to own, rather than renting its information.) Merrill did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on calls to retroactively make the resources an in-kind contribution and return the money already received. Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman, agreed that the DNC had gotten \u201ca return on our investment and more since obtaining all of the lists and data.\u201d Donna Brazile forged the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC in February 2017, while she was serving as interim DNC chairwoman. Brazile, who has been critical of how the Clinton campaign treated the DNC, said she believed the deal would help her successor as DNC chair \u201cinherit a party in good shape.\u201d \u201cI felt that it was a fair bargain at the time,\u201d she said. The current DNC chairman, Tom Perez, has amended the payment schedule, but the core of the accord \u2015 how much the DNC would pay and what it would get in return \u2015 remains in place, according to Hinojosa. The DNC paid Onward Together $300,000 in January and $135,000 in every subsequent month, according to Federal Election Commission filings and information provided by the DNC. Thus far, it has transferred $705,000 to Clinton\u2019s group; as of the end of this month, that sum will have increased to $840,000.\u00a0 The revelation of the sale of Clinton campaign resources to the DNC has struck a nerve with some Democratic officials because it exemplifies practices that they have criticized for years. These Democrats lament the transactional relationship of Democratic standard-bearers with the DNC and state parties, which often have a harder time fundraising. Former President Barack Obama withheld his campaign email list entirely from the DNC during his first term, using it instead to build his political group, Organizing for America (later renamed Organizing for Action). After Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, he initially allowed the DNC to use the list free of charge before formally donating it to the party body in 2015. Officials from state parties who joined the Clinton campaign\u2019s joint fundraising agreement during the 2016 election also complained that the campaign left state parties little funding to maintain their operations. Onward Together, which as a 501(c)(4) political nonprofit is not required to disclose its financial data, says it has distributed grants to 11 progressive groups, including Indivisible, Swing Left, Run for Something and Color of Change. However, there are many forms of political organizing that state parties, unlike those groups, are uniquely equipped to do. For example, state parties have historically played important roles in recruiting candidates for state and local office; advising and funding those candidates; and registering and turning out voters in down-ballot races. Another source of tension is what Sanders allies see as a double standard being applied to the Vermont senator\u2019s famously successful campaign email list. Although Sanders was not the Democratic presidential nominee, after the campaign, many Democrats called on Sanders to turn over his list to the DNC. (Sanders has declined to do so.) \u201cThey weren\u2019t saying Bernie, \u2018Rent your list.\u2019 They wanted the list,\u201d said Jim Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the DNC\u2019s Unity and Reform Commission. \u201cThey said, \u2018All candidates do this \u2015 they turn it over to the party.\u2019 Well, now I find out that they don\u2019t.\u201d Zogby, who refused to comment on the conduct of the Clinton campaign, was one of several reformers who pressed the Unity Commission to recommend the creation of a financial oversight committee at the DNC with full access to the party\u2019s budget data. He hopes that the latest revelation will increase support among the DNC\u2019s membership to approve the oversight committee and other financial transparency measures. The entire DNC membership is due to vote on the proposals in August. \u201cIt is critical to the ultimate survival of the party as a viable institution,\u201d Zogby said.'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Ford Urges Thousands Of Pickup Owners To Stop Driving After New Airbag Death', body='WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it had confirmed a second death in an older pickup truck caused by a defective airbag inflator of Takata Corp and urged 2,900 owners in North America to stop driving immediately until they can get replacement parts. The second largest U.S. automaker said it confirmed in late December that a July 2017 crash death in West Virginia in a 2006 Ford Ranger was caused by a defective Takata inflator. It previously reported a similar death in South Carolina that occurred in December 2015. Ford said both Takata deaths occurred with inflators built on the same day installed in 2006 Ranger pickups. At least 21 deaths worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can rupture and send deadly metal fragments inside vehicles. The faulty inflators have led to the largest automotive recall in history. The other 19 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co vehicles, most of which were in the United States. Ford issued a new recall for automobiles that had been previously recalled in 2016. Of the 391,000-plus 2004-2006 Ranger vehicles recalled at the time, the new recall announced on Thursday affects 2,900 vehicles. These include 2,700 in the United States and nearly 200 in Canada. The new recall will allow for identification of the 2,900 owners in the highest risk pool. A Mazda Motor Corp spokeswoman said on Thursday the company would conduct a similar recall and stop-drive warning for some 2006 Mazda B-Series trucks, which were built by Ford and are similar to the Ranger. Japanese auto supplier Takata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China\u2019s Ningo Joyson Electric Corp, for $1.6 billion. A Takata spokesman said the company will make all attempts to ensure it can deliver replacement inflators as soon as possible. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urged owners to heed Ford\u2019s warning. \u201cIt is extremely important that all high-risk airbags are tracked down and replaced immediately,\u201d NHTSA spokeswoman Karen Aldana said. Ford said it would pay to have vehicles towed to dealerships or send mobile repair teams to owners\u2019 homes and provide free loaner vehicles if needed. Takata said in June that it has recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States. Some 19 automakers worldwide are impacted. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks and have injured more than 200. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June. In 2017, prosecutors in Detroit charged three former senior Takata executives with falsifying test results to conceal the inflator defect. None have come to the United States to face charges. Last year, Takata pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was subject to pay a total of $1 billion in criminal penalties in a U.S. court in connection with the recalls. Automakers have struggled to get enough replacement parts for the massive recalls. A November NHTSA report said about two-thirds of U.S. vehicles recalled have not yet been repaired. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday the latest death is evidence of \u201cthe very definition of a failed recall\u201d pointing to the earlier Ford death in 2015. NHTSA must do more, he said, to make the recall a priority. In November, NHTSA rejected a petition from Ford to delay recalling 3 million vehicles with potentially defective airbag inflators to conduct additional testing. In June 2016, NHTSA warned airbag inflators on more than 300,000 unrepaired recalled 2001-2003 model year Honda vehicles showed a substantial risk of rupturing, and urged owners to stop driving them until getting them fixed. NHTSA said they have as high as a 50 percent chance of a rupture in a crash.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Even more remarkable, the robot seems to have tapped into this tender side all on its own. \"We never taught it that,\" Siddhartha Srinivasa, an associate professor of robotics at the school, said in a press release. The robot, dubbed the Home Exploring Robot Butler (HERB), uses a series of algorithms to solve problems and move objects around. HERB's most remarkable feature is the ability to both recognize specific types of items and move them to certain areas. In a video shared by Carnegie Mellon, HERB can be seen locating blocks and sorting them according to color. Srinivasa's goal is for robotic assistants to move out of factories and into your home. In a factory setting, robots can be programmed to follow a very specific routine, but homes are more chaotic. The ability to recognize and handle items according to context is key. In other words:\u00a0You need a robot butler that can understand what \"grab me a beer\" means. You wouldn't want one that opens the fridge and interprets every item within as the same thing. Nor would you want a robot that has to move every single item in the fridge to access your Budweiser. \"When a person reaches for a milk carton in a refrigerator, he doesn\u2019t necessarily move every other item out of the way,\" Carnegie Mellon explained in its press release. \"Rather, a person might move an item or two, while shoving others out of the way as the carton is pulled out.\" The action of removing an item from a fridge seems so simple in human terms. You just reach out and grab it. But consider the fairly complex set of actions you're following when you do so. Your brain tells your arm to reach up and pull the fridge open. Your eyes locate what you want. Then you navigate \"obstacles\" in the way (some old pasta sauce, maybe, or a stick of butter), close your fingers around the drink, remove your arm while clasping it and push the refrigerator shut. From a programming perspective, that's challenging: Machines lack your human intuition, so it's up to algorithms and artificial intelligence to get the job done. \"So, our algorithm learns to cradle the object in the same way you learn to solve the Rubik's cube,\" Srinivasa explained in an email to The Huffington Post.\u00a0\"We are also actively developing ...\u00a0algorithms that simultaneously learn the rules of engagement as they solve problems. This is critical because physical properties like friction are hard to estimate and change all the time.\" Put a different way, HERB learns according to context. It realized that the best way to transport a certain item was to cradle it, so that's what it did, expressing some measure of \"creativity\" in the process. Srinivasa told HuffPost he hopes his team's research will bring us closer to robotic assistants in our homes. \"If we want robots in our everyday lives, we need to either turn our homes into factory floors or enable robots to understand and work with the clutter and uncertainty in our homes,\" Srinivasa said. \"Our work takes a step towards solving that problem.\"'}.

The storm created tornadoes in Bone Gap and Miller City, Illinois, in Mount Carmel, Noblesville and Vincennes in Indiana, and in Paducah, Kentucky, the National Weather Service said. The storm also forced the Chicago Bears to halt their game against the Baltimore Ravens and encourage fans at Soldier Field to seek shelter as the storm roared in. Chicago's two major airports also briefly stopped traffic with the metropolitan area was under a tornado watch. The city of Washington, Illinois, was hit hard by what the National Weather Service called a \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornado. Thirty-one people injured by the storm that hit Washington were being treated at St. Francis Medical Center, one of the main hospitals in nearby Peoria, according to hospital spokeswoman Amy Paul. Eight had traumatic injuries. Two people were killed in Washington County, Illinois, about 200 miles (320 km) south of Peoria, said Illinois Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Patti Thompson. The agency estimated that at least 70 homes were destroyed across the state. Stephen Wilson, a spokesman for Peoria's Proctor Hospital, said six or seven patients were being treated with minor injuries. \"Mostly cuts, bruises, some broken bones,\" he said. Photos from Washington, Illinois, showed buildings reduced to rubble and homes torn in half in the city of 15,000 people some 145 miles (233 km) southwest of Chicago. \"We have reports of homes being flattened, roofs being torn off,\" Sara Sparkman, a spokeswoman for the health department of Tazewell County, Illinois, where Washington is located, said in a telephone interview. \"We have actual whole neighborhoods being demolished by the storm.\" Sparkman said the storm also had caused damage in Washington and Pekin, south of Peoria. Many of the injuries appeared to have been caused by collapsing structures. \"Things falling on people's head, broken bones, deep cuts, things like that,\" Paul said. \"We're thinking it's not as bad as we thought it would be. I think a lot of people got to their basements in time.\" The Illinois National Guard sent a 10-person firefighting and search-and-rescue team to Washington to help with the recovery effort. Illinois State Police spokeswoman Monique Bond said mobile homes were toppled, roofs torn from homes, and trees uprooted. She said officials believe some people may be trapped in their basements under debris. The American Red Cross worked with emergency management officials to set up shelters and provide assistance to displaced residents, even as rescue workers searched for more people who might have been caught and trapped in the storm's path. The Washington tornado came out of a fast-moving storm system that was headed toward Chicago and threatened a large swath of the Midwest with dangerous winds, thunderstorms and hail, U.S. weather officials said. \"We obviously have a very dangerous situation on our hands,\" Laura Furgione, deputy director of the National Weather Service, told reporters on a conference call. Tornado warnings were in effect for parts of Indiana and Kentucky. Weather officials urged residents of areas with tornado warnings in place to take cover in interior, low-floor rooms of study buildings. The NWS's Storm Prediction Center said the storm moved dangerously fast, tracking eastward at 60 miles per hour (97 kph). This storm system has some similarities to the fast-moving \"derecho\" storm that knocked out power to more than 4.2 million people and killed 22 in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions in June 2012, according to Bill Bunting, forecast branch chief at the Storm Prediction Center. \"The line of storms today, we believe, when it's fully mature, will actually be larger than the areas that were affected by the derecho in June of 2012,\" Bunting said. \"However, this will also be accompanied by a worse tornado threat in the areas that we've highlighted and large hail in Illinois and Wisconsin.\" (Additional reporting by Deborah Zabarenko, Jonathan Allen and Carey Gillam; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Trott)'}.

Members of\u00a0Project RECOVER, a collaborative effort to seek out the final resting places of World War II armed forces personnel,\u00a0discovered the U.S. Navy TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber in March. However, it took a couple of months to secure the location and collect DNA samples, so they felt it was appropriate to announce the new WWII crash site as Memorial Day weekend approached. \"It was a way of saying that we do care, that Memorial Day is an important day. The two just happened to come together and it seemed to make sense to us,\" said Patrick Scannon, founder of\u00a0the BentProp Project, one of the entities that make up Project RECOVER. Established in 2012, Project RECOVER was co-founded by the BentProp Project, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment.\u00a0Their efforts combine science, technology and archival research to find the remains of MIAs lost among Palau's underwater coral reefs and mangrove forests. Here is newly-released Project RECOVER video showing the Avenger's final resting place on the ocean floor, 80 feet below the surface of the water. Pictured below is a typical three-person crew TBM-1C Avenger aircraft that saw combat during WWII. Project RECOVER aims to locate as many MIAs as possible so that the U.S. government may bring them home for a proper burial. \"This recovery is another step closer towards Project RECOVER's goal of finding the final underwater resting places of all Americans missing in action since World War II,\" stated Dan Friedkin, who is chairman of the\u00a0Air Force Heritage Flight Foundation\u00a0and provides financial backing for Project RECOVER.\u00a0\"Every family member impacted by the loss of a service member deserves this type of closure.\" The primary search region for missing-in-action American aircraft and their crews centers around Palau, located in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea.\u00a0Scripps Institution of Oceanography estimates that there are several dozen U.S. aircraft and the remains of some 80 American MIAs in the area. The BentProp Project has focused on this endeavor for 20 years, conducting historical and archival research to support yearly month-long searches. \"We've always limited ourselves to one area -- the republic of Palau, but that's only because there's a lot of missing aircraft there,\" physician and BentProp founder Scannon told The Huffington Post. \"When we were thinking of a name, the first thing that came to my mind was that I always see bent propellers at these crash sites. We decided that it captured the tragedy and it just stuck.\" The people involved with the BentProp Project have individual backgrounds and skills in areas crossing over aviation, archaeology, history, navigation, photography and anthropology -- all necessary ingredients to look for and find these crash sites. Partnering with UCSD and the University of Delaware in 2012 has made even more discoveries possible. \"Since we started jointly working together, we found a total of six aircraft underwater ... and we have up to 10 MIA associated with the crashes,\" Scripps oceanographer Eric Terrill told HuffPost. \"Five of those are U.S. aircraft, one was a Japanese airplane, and several of those aircraft have MIAs associated with them.\"\u00a0 \"Many times, targets are very apparent in the sonar imagery, and others take a while to analyze the data to find the manmade objects,\" Terrill said. \"Sonar doesn't give us a clear-cut picture, especially a lot of these wrecks that don't necessarily look like an airplane once they've broken up, as the wings get torn off and the engines get pulled off.\" Yet even after 70 years, Terrill says, seawater helps preserve the remains of those lost in action.\u00a0\"Between DNA techniques, dental records and dog tags, there's a number of different forensic tools that the U.S. government has at their fingertips ...\u00a0to do the identification process,\" he explained. Pending final DNA identification of the missing Avenger crew members, the families will be notified. \"One only has to be with a family, once the remains are returned, to understand how important this is,\" Scannon said. \"My initial thought was, 'would the families even care?' But once I started meeting them, I realized very quickly that families of MIAs never quit -- they never stop missing the person who's been taken out of their lives. Even more surprising is that second and third generation family members often have stronger feelings because they never met the person.\" Scannon described what it's like when he's underwater and discovers a crash site for the first time. \"It is an arresting moment...almost like a knee jerk. I pull up and look at it and realize that we haven't found just a historically interesting site, but we've found the temporary tomb of Americans who've been missing in action for a long, long time. It is a privilege to be there and a privilege to finally study and know what happened so that the families can understand the fate of their loved ones. \"A whole bunch of different emotions crowd in all at once. My pulse goes up, I'm probably breathing faster than I should and just try to take in the moment. The thing that somehow seals it for me is I try to find one part of the plane that is as close as I can get to where the crew was and I touch that, and that moment of touching, to me, somehow seals the reality -- that I'm not just looking at it, that it's real. I think it affects all of us that way.\"\u00a0 \"Certainly, it's a national responsibility to find and recover remains from our past wars,\" added Terrill. \"It's a great teaching moment to remind the American public about a lot of the sacrifices family members have made. For me, personally, it's been very humbling to take some of my trade craft from ocean science and ocean technology and apply it to this type of problem.\"'}.

About one-quarter of the human-made CO2 emissions have been absorbed by oceans creating yet another environmental problem of global concern.  We are changing seawater chemistry through a type of carbon sequestration.  This creates a potential environmental disaster in the ocean and delays the inevitable temperature rise associated with our CO2 emissions.  Starting with the impact from the ocean's perspective -- CO2 is absorbed and dissolved in water which forms carbonic acid.    Image credit Carbonic acid releases the acidic proton, increasing acidity and decreasing the amount of carbonate ion, tipping the balance of the \"saturation state\" of calcium carbonate -- the building block for shells.  These changes in the ocean water chemistry spell disaster not just for shellfish (molluscs) but for the entire marine ecosystem. Acidification threatens yields of seafood for communities that rely on the oceans for their economy and to feed their own people.

As the Macondo trial's Phase Two began in U.S. District Court in New Orleans Monday, with Judge Carl Barbier presiding, BP contractors Transocean and Halliburton were aligned with the plaintiffs, including Louisiana and Alabama, against BP. The aligned parties contend BP was grossly negligent in responding to the spill that followed the April 20, 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion. They claim the well could have been capped that May, instead of the following July. Phase Two includes the federal government's consolidated, civil action against BP and Anadarko under the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act.  Phase Two is divided into a couple of parts. The first segment, which lasted four days and wrapped up Thursday, was about source control, Barbier said. \"This involves evidence and testimony as to what occurred at the time the Deepwater Horizon sank, the riser fractured and oil began to escape, until 87 days later when the well was capped,\" he said. In Phase Two's first segment, Barbier allowed each side--the aligned parties versus BP--15 hours of testimony. Starting on Oct. 7, the second part of Phase Two--the quantification segment--begins. In it, the parties are the United States versus BP and Anadarko. \"I've allowed twelve days, a total of 45 hours for each side, for quantification,\" Barbier said. Penalties won't be assessed in Phase Two but will be the subject of a later trial. Attorney Brian Barr, in his opening statement Monday for the aligned parties, said BP's spill-response plan before the Macondo accident was almost 600-pages with just one page on source control. That page said if the spill's source couldn't be controlled by the operator or remote means, BP would assemble experts to respond. BP's plan was simply a plan to plan, and \"responders were left to make things up on the fly as oil gushed into the Gulf,\" Barr said.  Barr said the feds didn't have the know-how to shut the well. \"That expertise was expected to rest with the operator BP,\" he said. The government wasn't aware that BP had neither the experience nor procedures in place to stop the flow, however. Barr said if BP had been prepared for a possible blowout, the well could have been capped within days or weeks, not months. In his opening statement, Brad Brian on behalf of Transocean and the aligned parties, said BP misrepresented the flow rate in April and May of 2010, delaying the well's capping. BP repeatedly said 5,000 barrels a day was its best flow estimate and withheld documents showing much higher rates. \"The consequences of BP's misrepresentations and concealment were bad decisions, a false diagnosis of why the top kill source-control method they used failed, and tragically the rejection in May of an alternative strategy--the blowout preventer on blowout preventer that was ready to be installed and would have capped this well long before it was capped,\" Brian said. A top kill attempt, which involved pumping drilling mud to stop the well's flow, failed in late May 2010. A BOP is a safety device used to seal a well.   In January of this year, BP pleaded guilty to withholding internal documents containing flow estimates that were well above 5,000 barrels per day, Brian noted. During the spill, BP modelers sent possible flow rates of 110,000 barrels per day and higher to their bosses in BP, he said. On May 10, 2010, BP edited a chart in order to show a much lower, worst-case scenario of the flow, and inserted a most likely rate of 5,000 barrels a day.  \"On May 16, 2010, the Unified Command approved BP's recommendation to do the top kill,\" Brian said. The Unified Command included the U.S. Coast Guard and a number of other federal agencies, along with BP and Transocean. \"But within hours of that decision, they learned from their outside consultant, Dr. Ole Rygg at Add Energy, that the top kill procedure they were contemplating wouldn't work if the well was flowing at 15,000 barrels per day or higher,\" Brian said. Add Energy, based in Norway with an office in Houston, was contracted by BP to assist in well control. Even after the top kill effort failed in May, BP still wouldn't admit the size of its flow rate, Brian said. BP's false flow statements shaped the recovery effort and greatly delayed the well's capping, he said. In his opening statement Monday, Don Godwin for Halliburton and the aligned parties, also said BP's lowballing of the well's flow and its lack of preparation for a blowout delayed the capping process. Mike Brock, representing BP, in his opening noted that 700 engineers and technicians worked in the company's Houston center in two shifts a day during the spill. \"All of these people were dedicated to getting this well shut in as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"It defies common sense to say that we would delay by two months the shut-in because we didn't want to say something about why top kill had failed.\" Underlying its spill response, BP had several guiding principles, Brock said. \"First, don't take any action that makes matters worse,\" he said. \"You're going to see when we look at the decision about BOP-on-BOP, versus top kill versus other options like collection, that this is a significant overriding principle.\" The other principles were \"work options in parallel; leave no stone unturned; spare no expense,\" he said. Brock said the 5,000 barrel-per-day flow estimate came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Everyone understood that there was significant uncertainty that went with that number,\" he said. Federal scientists and technicians embedded in BP's Houston center were working closely with BP. \"They were talking at the water cooler,\" he said. \"They were openly sharing data at that center.\" Brock said the feds weren't misled and knew the flow rate could be over 15,000 barrels per day before the top-kill procedure was attempted. \"Ultimately, the capping stack was utilized to seal the well on July 15, 2010,\" Brock said. \"BP did not misrepresent flow rate in a way that caused a delay of the shut-in. It made reasonable engineering decisions based on what was known at each step along the way, keeping in mind the principles of do no harm, work all options in parallel, leave no stone unturned. That's not fraud. That's not gross negligence.\" A capping stack is a device used to shut off the flow from a well. On Monday, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology professor John Wilson, under cross examination from Hariklia Karis on behalf of BP, discussed some of the problems with BP's having underestimated its flow. \"If the flow rate is sufficiently high, such that the momentum kill doesn't work, that also suggests the flow rate is sufficiently high because there's not a lot of obstructions in the blowout preventer,\" Wilson said. \"And if there are fewer obstructions in the BOP, there's less chance that the junk shot would succeed just by a matter of physics.\" Junk shots, something BP tried in late May 2010, involve injecting golf balls, shredded tires and other material to obstruct the flow of oil. Rob Turlak, who manages subsea engineering and well-control systems for Transocean, worked on a BOP-on-BOP installation plan to cap the well. But it was delayed in May and then shelved in June. Under examination from attorney Luis Li on behalf of Transocean and the aligned parties, Turlak said Tuesday he never got an explanation about why BP scrapped the BOP-on-BOP strategy. On Tuesday, Texas petroleum engineer Edward Ziegler, an aligned parties expert witness on well control, noted that BP admitted to having spent nothing on research and development for source plans. If the company had developed such plans before the blowout, the flow wouldn't have lasted so long, he said.  \"You need a real plan immediately when the event starts,\" Ziegler said. \"You have a well flowing out of control so you don't start having meetings and groups and trying things and different options. You actually have a plan and you immediately do it.\" He said BP considered various methods, including an initial plan to use a BOP on a BOP. \"Then they changed that,\" he said. BP changed plans about which rigs to use in its well-control operations. \"By the time they put the actual capping device on the well in July of 2010, that was the sixth different device they had started on,\" Ziegler said. BP could have placed a capping stack on the well on the seafloor in May, monitored pressures and might have closed the well by mid-May, he said. A capping device was readily available on Transocean's Discoverer Enterprise drilling rig but a plan to use it was scrapped, he said. \"I heard the BP gentleman in the opening say there were so many uncertainties and so many unknowns, and that's why BP couldn't do certain things,\" Ziegler said, referring to Brock's opening comments. But \"you have to get the data, and the way to get it is to put the cap on there with control-and-flow equipment and obtain the data,\" he said. \"Instead of worrying about it and fretting and wringing your hands for two months, just do it immediately.\" He said it was clear in July 2010 that the well had integrity but that could have been learned two months earlier.  On Wednesday, James Dupree, BP's chief operating officer of resource development and technology, testified about how the flow was stopped with a capping stack on July 15, 2010. \"We monitored the pressure,\" he said. \"We eventually were convinced that no broach was ongoing. We watched the sea floor so that there was no risk of a broach. Then we rigged up on the well and killed it by pumping mud down. We pumped a large cement slug into the well and cemented the well from the base.\" That process of installing the stack to cementing the base took 4.77 days. On Thursday, Iain Adams, managing director of well-engineering firm Norwell in Scotland and BP's expert witness on response to the blowout, said under examination from Hariklia Karis that a need to explore options, consider data and peer reviews, and mitigate risk extended the time it took to kill the well. \"If a pre-built capping stack had been installed the way the aligned parties suggested, in a week or a couple of weeks, you would have had to basically ignore the key risks of well integrity and installation vessels,\" he said. The three-ram stack that killed the well in July 2010 couldn't have been deployed immediately after the blowout because risks had to be considered first, he said. In testimony Tuesday, U.C. Berkeley engineering professor Robert Bea, a catastrophic risk expert, said that before the April 2010 accident BP estimated a Macondo blowout could cost between one hundred million and one billion dollars, while Bea had predicted it would greatly exceed ten billion dollars. end'}.

Anders Levermann said his study for the Potsdam Institute  for Climate Impact Research was the first to examine evidence  from climate history and combine it with computer simulations of  contributing factors to long-term sea-level increases: thermal  expansion of oceans, the melting of mountain glaciers and the  melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Scientists say global warming is responsible for the melting  ice. A U.N. panel of scientists, the IPCC, says heat-trapping  gases from burning fossil fuels are nudging up temperatures. A  small number of scientists dismiss human-influenced global  warming, arguing natural climate fluctuations are responsible. \"We're confident that our estimate is robust because of the  combination of physics and data that we used,\" Levermann told  Reuters. \"We think we've set a benchmark for how much sea levels  will rise along with temperature increases.\" Sea levels rose by 17 cm last century and the rate has  accelerated to more than 3 mm a year, according to the IPCC. A  third of the current rise is from Antarctica and Greenland. Almost 200 governments have agreed to limit global warming  to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above  pre-industrial times and plan to agree, by the end of 2015, a  deal to curb emissions. Global average surface temperatures have risen by 0.8C  (1.4F) since the Industrial Revolution and the IPCC has said  temperatures are likely to be 0.4 to 1.0 degrees Celsius warmer  from 2016-35 than in the two decades to 2005. \"In the past there was some uncertainty and people haven't  known by how much,\" Levermann said. \"We're saying now, taking  everything we know, that we've got a robust estimate of 2.3  meters (7 feet, 6.6 inches) of rising sea per degree (Celsius)  of warming.\"                 SCEPTICS Some scientific studies have projected sea level rise of up  to 2 metres by 2100, a figure that would swamp large tracts of  land from Bangladesh to Florida. David Vaughan, head of the Ice2sea project to narrow down  uncertainties about how melting ice will swell the oceans, has  said sea levels would rise by between 16.5 and 69 cm under a  scenario of moderate global warming this century. Vaughan told Reuters the biggest impact rising seas will  have is that storms will be more destructive in the near future. \"It's not about chasing people up the beach or the changing  shape of coastlines,\" he said. \"The big issue is how the storms  will damage our coasts and how often they occur. That'll  increase even with small levels of sea rise in coming decades.\" Climate sceptics, however, say the evidence is unconvincing.  Measurements of changing temperatures are unreliable,  contradictory and unsupported by solid historic data, they say. They question the accuracy of computer climate forecasts and  point to historic, cyclical changes in the world's temperature  as evidence that global temperature changes are natural.    Others say the evidence shows temperatures have stopped rising  and that the sun plays a bigger role than human activities. \"Continuous sea-level rise is something we cannot avoid  unless global temperatures go down again,\" Levermann said. \"Our  results indicate that major adaptation at our coastlines will be  necessary. It's likely that some currently populated regions  can't be protected in the long run.\"     (Reporting by Erik Kirschbaum; editing by Patrick Graham)'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced Tuesday that she would contribute $175,000 to efforts to Democratic groups trying to win back state legislatures and to fight partisan gerrymandering. In the last speech of the day at the Center for American Progress\u2019 Ideas Conference, where she was joined by many other rumored presidential contenders, Warren pledged the money as part of a multipronged effort to fix a \u201ccrisis in our democracy\u201d that she said has been building since long before President Donald Trump took office. The senior Massachusetts senator identified control of state governments and the congressional redistricting process as key ways to fight Republican efforts to infringe on voting rights. She called on Democrats to root out key GOP-led threats such as \u201cracist\u201d voter-ID laws, early voting restrictions, disenfranchisement of felons and partisan gerrymandering. \u201cI\u2019m doubling down on the importance of our voters \u2014 state by state \u2014 and I want to turn up the heat on gerrymandering,\u201d she said, according to the text of her prepared remarks. \u201cI\u2019m sending $175,000 to organizations on the front lines trying to win back our legislatures and fight for fair redistricting.  \u201cDemocrats believe in a fair fight, and making sure that districts aren\u2019t drawn to cut out one party or the other is a critical first step,\u201d she continued. Warren is splitting the cash among several Democratic campaign committees and groups. She is sending $8,000 each to nine Democratic legislature campaigns in states where Democrats hope to pick up seats: Florida, Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.  She is also contributing $30,000 each to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (a national party arm that helps elect Democratic state lawmakers) and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (a group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder that is devoted to fighting GOP-led partisan redistricting). The remainder of the $175,000 will be split among several nonprofit liberal resistance groups, including Forward Majority, a super PAC devoted to electing Democratic state lawmakers. Warren went further in her recommendations for restoring public faith in the idea, in support of what she called the fundamental principle that \u201cevery vote matters.\u201d She proposed amending the Constitution to establish\u00a0\u201can unquestioned, unassailable, nationally recognized right to vote.\u201d And she would crack down on the influence of special interests through three major reforms: requiring Cabinet members, agency heads and members of Congress to divest themselves of assets that pose a conflict of interest with their policy work; prohibiting presidents and those officials from lobbying after they leave their posts; and barring corporations from providing multimillion-dollar leave packages to executives so they can serve in government.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s dismantle the broken system that lets rich donors and giant companies undermine democracy by buying their way in Washington,\u201d she declared. Her $175,000 contribution is the latest in a series of moves by Warren designed to elect Democratic candidates and buttress the depleted party\u2019s presence across the country.  At a March fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0she announced a contribution of $250,000 to the 50 state Democratic parties, as well as a $15,000 donation to the DNC. The strategy is an implicit attempt to redress\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s relative inattention to Democratic Party infrastructure while he was president.\u00a0He received criticism for creating Organizing for Action, a separate political arm that skeptics believe deprived the party of much-needed attention and resources.  During Obama\u2019s two terms, the party lost some 1,000 state legislative seats, forfeiting control of 27 state legislative chambers. The timing of those losses, which began with the 2010 midterm elections, was especially harmful to the party because it enabled Republicans to draw extraordinarily partisan congressional and legislative district boundaries that entrenched their advantages. There is now a broad consensus among Democrats that ignoring the importance of state legislatures was a mistake of historic proportions. However, a clear subtext of Warren\u2019s address is her growing national political profile, including rumored presidential ambitions.  Warren, who has made a name for herself as Wall Street\u2019s toughest foe in Congress, has emerged as a leading small-dollar fundraiser. A large majority of the more than $27 million Warren has raised since 2013 has been in increments of less than $200, according to an April analysis in The Intercept. Although Warren is running for a second term in November, her use of her considerable campaign largesse to boost the fortunes of her fellow Democrats has fueled speculation that she has national aspirations. In all, she has raised or contributed nearly $15 million for Democratic candidates across the country, including the maximum allowed amount to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this year and last. Warren has taken a special interest in promoting Democrats with whom she has worked on her signature issue of financial industry regulation. This election cycle, she is backing the Ohio gubernatorial candidacy of Richard Cordray, the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Katie Porter, a former Warren student and consumer law professor now running in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District. The conference hosted by the CAP, the liberal think tank most closely aligned with the Democratic Party establishment, has become an important speechmaking stop for aspiring Democratic stars. This year Warren was joined on the speakers list by Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Corey Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), as well as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D), Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.), among others.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Facing Farm Bill Vote Problems, GOP Leaders May Have To Make A Deal', body='WASHINGTON \u2015 With GOP support for a farm bill wavering among moderates and conservatives, Republican leaders are facing a dilemma that may force them into a deal this week to at least temporarily kill a discharge petition on immigration \u2015 or not. House Freedom Caucus leaders emerged Tuesday night with a plan for more than a dozen members to\u00a0withhold support for the farm bill until leaders agreed to vote on the so-called Goodlatte bill, a hawkish immigration measure authored by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the judiciary committee. Republican immigration advocates are using the Goodlatte bill as a vehicle to get a vote on a plan addressing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program that Democrats would support. But members of the Freedom Caucus, seeing how close the chamber is to getting a vote on a Democratic-preferred DACA measure, is using their leverage on the farm bill to secure a vote on the Goodlatte bill to, in their minds, effectively kill the DACA discharge petition and reset the clock on when GOP moderates and Democrats could get a vote on the issue. The problem with this plan is that it isn\u2019t clear whether voting on Goodlatte would kill the discharge petition. Discharge petitions are used to bypass leadership decisions on which bills get a vote and can bring a bill to the floor with a minimum of 218 signatures. The current discharge petition is on a rule that would bring up Goodlatte and a number of other immigration proposals. Although conservatives in the Freedom Caucus think dispensing with Goodlatte would render the rule moot, it\u2019s possible that the Republicans and Democrats who support the discharge petition could change the rule. The uncertainty over the gambit is adding to the shakiness of the farm bill, as well as the Goodlatte bill, but\u00a0GOP leaders say they would like to avoid all these complications by voting on the Goodlatte proposal only if it has the votes to pass. The problem with that idea is that its author has shown little willingness to alter the legislation to make it more palatable to his fellow Republicans, and there may be a key number of Republicans who would side with Democrats for a solution for immigrants affected by DACA. These issues would normally be separate from the farm bill, which reauthorizes certain farm subsidies for five years and provides money for food stamps, but the Freedom Caucus wants to use the weak support for the farm bill as leverage. Nearly all Democrats intend to vote against the farm bill, and that, coupled with at least a dozen moderate Republicans signaling strong opposition to the bill and at least another dozen conservatives who understand the power they have to extract an immigration concession, means Republicans just don\u2019t have the votes. And because moderates look far more immovable than conservatives on the farm bill, the GOP leadership is forced to deal with the representatives whose votes can be bought. Some Republicans from New Jersey and New York and possibly some from Pennsylvania look poised to vote against the farm bill when it\u2019s supposed to come up for a vote on Friday, no matter what, and a smattering of other members could have problems too, particularly if the right \u2015 or wrong \u2015 amendments are adopted or rejected. That means GOP leaders don\u2019t have the votes to pass the bill if more than a dozen conservatives oppose the legislation. And with leadership stating its preference to avoid the discharge petition anyway, GOP aides said the clearest path to victory on the farm bill may be to just give conservatives what they want \u2015 only that may change if the gambit to kill the discharge petition wouldn\u2019t work anyway. What conservatives ultimately want is still up in the air. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Tuesday night that he wanted a vote on the Goodlatte bill to happen concurrently with the farm bill so that leaders couldn\u2019t go back on their word, but he also said he could give GOP leaders some leeway if they promised to hold a vote, say, next week. Of course, that was when Meadows was under the belief that voting on Goodlatte would at least delay the discharge petition. Now conservatives may regroup and think of a different ask. But even if Republicans reach a deal among themselves, they may still have problems passing the farm bill. There are still a significant number of moderates opposing the bill, and there are likely a few conservatives who will vote \u201cno\u201d regardless of whether leadership cuts a deal, particularly if there\u2019s no feasible agreement on immigration.  Passage could come down to how many Democrats support the bill, and not many are expected to vote \u201cyes.\u201d Another potential issue concerns the Republicans who support the discharge petition. On Wednesday, those Republicans seemed to be caught flat-footed by the Freedom Caucus\u2019 gambit. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who told HuffPost she is voting against the farm bill, said she hadn\u2019t heard anything about conservatives trying to kill the discharge petition. And Mario Diaz-Balart, another pro-immigration Republican from Florida, said he was concentrating on appropriations (though he said he supported the farm bill). GOP moderates could still band together to oppose the farm bill if their leadership worked out some mechanism to give conservatives what they want by somehow killing the discharge petition, but there seems to be no organized effort to do that at the moment. Republicans have acknowledged that passing the farm bill with only GOP votes would be difficult, but they now find themselves negotiating against different factions of the conference. The farm bill combines welfare for farmers and the much bigger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is commonly known as food stamps and is one of the federal government\u2019s biggest anti-poverty programs. It helps 40 million Americans buy food every month.  Most Republicans in Congress think there are too many people on the program who should be working instead, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said reforming SNAP would make it easier for employers to fill available jobs.  The bill would expand a SNAP work requirement \u2015 which currently applies to recipients ages 18 to 49 who don\u2019t have minor children or disabilities \u2015 to people in their 50s and parents of minors older than 6. There would be several exemptions, but generally, the requirement would be to work 20 hours a week or spend that amount of time in an approved activity, such as enrollment in a government training program that the legislation would create.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the expanded work requirement would reduce enrollment by an additional 1.2 million people in 2028. With no policy change, the office expects enrollment to decline by 8 million by then because of the improving economy. But some moderates \u2015 and almost all Democrats \u2015 see those changes as an assault on food stamps. There\u2019s also a significant battle brewing over sugar subsidies in the farm bill. Some members from areas where sugar is grown want higher prices, while companies using it to make products like candy and soda want cheaper sugar. GOP leaders believe they can find the right balance to \u2014 ahem \u2014 sweeten the bill for some Republicans, but they may end up ostracizing some members and further complicating the vote math.'}.

I have been preparing for this day to come. Knowing the \u201cfootball machine,\u201d I didn\u2019t think he would be blackballed in the same way that Kaepernick has been by the NFL \u2015 and yes, that\u2019s an intentional jab. I expected someone to hire Briles and I expected to be outraged along with most of the nation. What I didn\u2019t expect is the shift in conversation around college coaching vs. professional coaching and America vs. Canada. Suddenly, I\u2019m reading comments like \u201cI have zero issue if a professional team wants to hire Art Briles\u201d; \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t belong on a college campus\u201d; and \u201cThe Canadian league \u2015 at least he\u2019s not in the U.S. anymore.\u201d Here\u2019s why this discussion is so upsetting to me. Yes, Art Briles is not in charge of impressionable young college men. He\u2019s now in charge of adult men with jobs in the CFL. So, the threat of him influencing their minds in a negative way may be less, but it\u2019s still there. There has been nothing to prove to me that Briles has changed his personal beliefs or attitudes that contributed to the mess at Baylor and he is still in a position of power and influence over these new players. Not to mention, and I think we can all agree, violence doesn\u2019t just automatically become a non-issue in professional sports. How many stories about violence in the NFL riddle our social media timelines every day? Let\u2019s also not forget the influence Art Briles had on his coaching staff at Baylor \u2015 grown men who should have known better. Does anyone really think that what happened on that football team had nothing to do with his coaching staff? Briles had help. He didn\u2019t act alone and now his genius football brain along with his dangerous attitudes and beliefs are going to be influencing a new coaching staff of well-intentioned men. Notice, I used the term \u201cgenius football brain.\u201d I say this because he has a great offensive mind. He has proven he can turn a losing team into a winning one, but at what cost? Best case scenario, the Tiger-Cats start winning, but then what? Will greed, fame, and the addictive feeling of winning kick in so hard that they forget their moral compass? We saw it happen at Baylor. And once Briles is touted as the hero who turned around another losing team, won\u2019t it only be a matter of time before he is back in a head coaching position? Maybe even at a college? It\u2019s easy to see where this road goes. And can we just talk about the survivors for a second? Briles supported, participated in, and helped cultivate an environment that allowed women to be raped. How is his influence any different at the professional level? How is his influence any different in Canada? All women matter. A woman\u2019s worth should not be determined by her age and geographical location. Art Briles dismissed, minimized, and ignored violence against women at Baylor University in America and he can do it in Canada at the CFL. Art Briles should not be coaching. He lost that privilege. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to this issue. Survivors will struggle with their trauma for the rest of their lives. Art Briles does not deserve a second chance in football. His second chance is in the pursuit of redemption and becoming a better person. Rape survivors do not have the luxury of ever returning to \u201cthe life they once knew,\u201d and neither should Art Briles. The hiring of Art Briles by the CFL sends a strong message that they do not value the safety of women and that winning is more important than human life. The hiring of Art Briles by ANY football organization will send the exact same message \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a high school team, a college team, a pro team, or if it\u2019s in America or Canada or Pakistan. The message is still the same\u2026 and it\u2019s the wrong.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Cyber crooks may have stolen names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, the company said. Unprotected passwords, payment card data and bank account information did not appear to have been compromised, Yahoo said, signaling that some of the most valuable user data was not taken. \u201cThis is the biggest data breach ever,\u201d\u009d said well-known cryptologist Bruce Schneier. He said it was too early to say what impact the breach might have on Yahoo and its users because many questions remain, including the identity of the state-sponsored hackers behind it. It was not immediately clearly when Yahoo learned of the hack and why it took two years to come to light. The size of the attack on Yahoo was unprecedented compared to other corporate breaches such as at eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2014 which involved personal data of 145 million users. The Yahoo breach, which follows a rising number of other large-scale data breaches, could make it a watershed event that prompts the government and businesses alike to put more effort into bolstering defenses, said Dan Kaminsky, a well-known Internet security expert. \u201cFive hundred of the Fortune 500 have been hacked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything has changed, it\u2019s that these attacks are getting publicly disclosed.\u201d Three U.S. intelligence officials, who declined to be identified by name, said they believed the attack was state-sponsored because of its resemblance to previous hacks traced to Russian intelligence agencies or hackers acting at their direction. Yahoo said it was working with law enforcement on the matter. The FBI said it was aware of the matter, and the U.S. Secret Service was not immediately available for comment. \u201cThe investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo\u2019s network,\u201d the company said. VERIZON DEAL Shares of Yahoo stock closed a penny higher at $44.15, while shares of Verizon Communications (VZ.N), which has agreed to buy the company\u2019s Internet business, were up about 1 percent. It was not clear how this disclosure might affect Yahoo\u2019s deal with Verizon. Verizon, which announced in July an agreement to buy Yahoo\u2019s core internet properties for $4.83 billion, said in a statement it was made aware of the breach within the last two days and had limited information about the matter. \u201cWe will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities,\u201d the company said. Technology website Recode first reported Tuesday that Yahoo planned to disclose details about a data breach affecting hundreds of millions of users. That followed an Aug. 1 story on the technology news site Motherboard, which said a cyber criminal known as Peace was selling the data of about 200 million Yahoo users but did not confirm its authenticity. Peace has previously claimed responsibility. Peace also previously attempted to sell on a hacker forum information purportedly belonging to hundreds of millions of accounts at MySpace and LinkedIn, including names, passwords and email addresses.

No fees! \u201cWhen an advisor says there is no commission involved you should be leery,\u201d says Brent Wilsey, who runs the San Diego-based Wilsey Asset Management. \u201cAs much as you may hope, most likely they are not going to do their job for free.\u201d Instead, companies build a fa\u00e7ade that makes it look like your investment is fee-free. \u201cBut in reality, they hide the fees by burying them deep into documents,\u201d he adds. In other words: There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cfree.\u201d Trust me, I have a title. \u201cThat is perhaps the biggest lie,\u201d says Warren Ward, a Columbus, Ind.-based financial advisor. There\u2019s so much title confusion in the industry, and it\u2019s a confusion that unscrupulous advisors often take advantage of. \u201cThey are apparently free to call themselves pretty much anything: advisor, counselor, wealth manager,\u201d he adds. Ward is a Certified Financial Planner, a significant designation requiring the completion of multiple college courses and passing a two-day exam, but the law allows his less studied colleagues to call themselves anything. And, in an industry that\u2019s already confusing, that\u2019s enough to fool some investors. Look at these returns! Funny math is common among some financial advisers. Some advisers overstate compound interest, for example. \u201cIt\u2019s a prevalent, egregious lie that never gets challenged,\u201d says Jordan Wolff, the chief savings officer for Shrinkabill Services, a financial services firm. The equation is something like this: \u201cIf you invest $A over the course of B years you will earn $C because the average rate of return of this fund (or market) is D%\u201d But wait. \u201cThe problem with this equation is that no one can score that rate of return every year,\u201d says Wolff. The math treats this as a consistent earning every year. And that\u2019s not accurate. Did we forget to mention that? Few advisors will tell you an outright lie, says Kevin O\u2019Brien, president of Peak Financial Services. \u201cLies of omission are probably more common,\u201d he adds. How so? Many terms and fees are buried in difficult-to-read prospectuses, and you may not be able to decipher the true costs of some investments. \u201cBecause of this non-transparency, advisors may not be forthcoming, unless clients specifically ask about the costs and how the investment is priced out,\u201d he adds. Remember, Registered Investment Advisors and Investment Advisor Representatives are required to act in a fiduciary role, while Registered Representatives may earn a commission. This investment has no risk. There\u2019s no such thing as no risk, says financial advisor Ilene Davis. \u201cWhile a bond or CD may guarantee return of principal, purchasing power loss is a risk not often discussed,\u201d she says. It\u2019s OK to refer to such investments as \u201clow-risk,\u201d but to call them \u201cno-risk\u201d investments is a lie. If your advisor is telling you otherwise, you might want to look elsewhere. It\u2019s do or die. Shady investment advisors love fear tactics. \u201cIf you don\u2019t act now, the situation will change and you won\u2019t succeed,\u201d says Carol Fabbri, the managing partner of Fair Advisors, an independent financial advisory firm. \u201cYour kids won\u2019t go to college. You\u2019ll eat cat food.\u201d Planning is not a drama or a reality television show, she says. It takes patience to succeed. Bad advisors push clients to make a decision because they are afraid of losing a sale, not because the market is going to change. If your advisor is scaring you, maybe you have the wrong advisor. How to avoid this? By choosing the right advisor in the first place, says James Pollard, a marketing consultant for the website TheAdvisorCoach.com. \u201cInterview multiple financial advisors,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to do this rather than just pick one, especially since some advisors might not mesh well with your goals or personality. Interviewing several financial advisors will give you a better perspective on the right fit for you.\u201d Also, pay attention to how your financial advisor discusses and approaches risk. The best and most trustworthy financial advisors tend to be completely open about risk. If someone downplays risks, run for the hills. Finally, do a background check on your advisor. A financial advisor\u2019s Form ADV, the form used by an investment advisor to register with both the Securities and Exchange Commission and state securities authorities, will let you know of any problems. If you see anything suspicious, move on. The federal government\u2019s latest actions may have given financial advisors a right to lie, but now you know how to prevent that from happening.

USA Hockey, the sport\u2019s American federation, and the U.S. women\u2019s team announced in a joint press release that they had reached an agreement \u201cthat will result in groundbreaking support for the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team program over the course of the next four years.\u201d \u201cToday reflects everyone coming together and compromising in order to reach a resolution for the betterment of the sport,\u201d said Jim Smith, president of USA Hockey. \u201cWe\u2019ll now move forward together knowing we\u2019ll look back on this day as one of the most positive in the history of USA Hockey.\u201d The two sides agreed to keep financial terms of the deal private. But the deal includes the formation of a new advisory group made up of current and former players that will \u201cassist USA Hockey in efforts to advance girls\u2019 and women\u2019s hockey,\u201d the release said. \u201cOur sport is the big winner today,\u201d said Meghan Duggan, the team\u2019s captain. \u201cWe stood up for what we thought was right and USA Hockey\u2019s leadership listened. In the end, both sides came together.\u201d The agreement means the U.S. women\u2019s team will return to the ice for the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship, which begins in Plymouth, Michigan, on March 31. To Our Dearest Fans,Together, WE dared to make history. And couldn't have done it without you. See you at #2017WWC#BeBoldForChange #OwnIt pic.twitter.com/ib496rUzCw More than a year of private negotiations between the players and USA Hockey over compensation and other forms of financial support exploded into a public battle on March 15, when the USWNT threatened to skip the International Ice Hockey Federation Women\u2019s World Championship unless they made\u00a0\u201csignificant progress\u201d in talks with the federation.\u00a0The dispute threatened to leave the tournament without its host and defending champion. The United States won the tournament\u2019s gold medal in 2016, and has won six of the last eight world championship gold medals overall. The boycott centered on a lack of financial support for the women\u2019s team. The players wanted better compensation from the federation, which they said only provided small monthly stipends during a six-month Olympic training period \u2015 but otherwise did not pay the players during the other 3 1/2 years of each Olympic cycle. They also pointed to insufficient support for travel and marketing, and what they saw as USA Hockey\u2019s disparate support for men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey at the development level: While USA Hockey spends $3.5 million annually on its national team program for boys, they said, girls receive no \u201ccomparable\u201d support. USA Hockey disputed those claims, and initially began seeking out replacement players to field a team in the tournament.\u00a0 The boycott appeared near its end last Monday, when USA Hockey officials met with nine players and the team\u2019s attorneys in Philadelphia. More than 10 hours of \u201cproductive\u201d meetings left players feeling hopeful that a deal was close. But the talks collapsed later in the week, and USA Hockey again extended invites to other players in hopes of placing a team of replacements in the world championship. Women\u2019s players at the collegiate, high school and even recreational level, however, remained committed to the national team\u2019s cause, publicly posting on Twitter that they had declined the federation\u2019s invites.\u00a0 Members of the women\u2019s team said all along that they hoped to reach a deal that would allow them to return to the ice in time for the world championships. \u201cWe want to play,\u201d Duggan told The Huffington Post the day the boycott began. \u201cWe want this to get resolved. We want to come to an agreement that USA Hockey and ourselves can both be on board with.\u201d As of last Friday, players were willing to \u201cshow up the day before the game if we have to,\u201d USWNT forward Monique Lamoureux told HuffPost. That, in effect, is what they will do. The U.S. will hold its first practice Thursday night, one day before they begin the tournament against Canada. USA Hockey\u2019s board met for several hours Monday night, once again fueling hopes that a deal was near. But the evening ended without a resolution. USA Hockey sent a new proposal to the players Tuesday morning, and players voted to ratify the agreement after hours of negotiation over unspecified terms in the deal.\u00a0 In the end, the agreement highlighted the power of the women\u2019s commitment to the boycott, and its ability to stretch beyond their sport. Members of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team, who have battled their own federation over equal pay issues, stood behind the hockey team almost immediately. Support for their fight eventually spread across the sports world.\u00a0Unions representing Major League Baseball, NBA, NFL and NHL players all backed the women\u2019s hockey team.\u00a0WNBA and women\u2019s college basketball players tweeted in favor of them; and members of the men\u2019s national hockey team reportedly threatened to join them\u00a0in boycotting the world championship.\u00a0 On Monday, 16 members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to USA Hockey\u2019s executive director\u00a0backing the players and urging a quick end to the dispute.\u00a0 The deal, which will extend beyond the 2018 Winter Olympics, affirmed the larger cause Duggan and the players said they had committed to when the boycott began. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than hockey,\u201d Duggan\u00a0said that day. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than any one sport or individual. It\u2019s about equitable support for females in this country. This is a difficult thing for us, but we\u2019re united and proud and happy to do it.\u201d'}.

Last June, the former Marine fighter pilot retired from the military to move home to Kentucky and launch a political career. McGrath is everything a national Democratic campaign official would want in a new candidate \u2015 she is a woman and a veteran, and while she isn\u2019t a small business owner, her husband is. Still, she struggled to win over Democratic Party insiders in Kentucky and Washington, most of whom were waiting for Jim Gray, the popular mayor of Lexington, to decide whether he would pursue Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District seat instead. So in July, with a bit of money in the bank and desperation beginning to set in, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, decided that he had to do something crazy. He told McGrath, who hadn\u2019t yet unpacked from her move, to dig her bomber jacket out of a box. He took his fledgling candidate to Lexington\u2019s Blue Grass Airport, stood her in front of a fighter jet, and told Mark Putnam, the ad man who has made Democratic candidates from Missouri to Wisconsin go viral, to start filming. The ad that resulted told a simple story: As a child, McGrath begged her congressman to help overturn the military\u2019s ban on women in combat, to no avail. But the Pentagon reversed course when she was in high school. She enrolled in the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marines and became the first woman to ever fly an F-18 fighter jet in combat. McGrath relates this anecdote over b-roll of soaring jets, with a quick departure to point out that Republicans want to take away Kentuckians\u2019 health care. You could discern the message of the commercial all the way from Paducah: McGrath is a woman and a fighter, and she won\u2019t be deterred from achieving her goals.\u00a0 When Nickolas answered his cell phone on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, the day he planned to launch the ad, the voice on the other end had bad news: McGrath had raised just $50,000 so far. The ad had cost $57,000. Her campaign was $7,000 in the red, and she\u2019d barely said hello. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Did I just destroy her career?\u2019\u201d Nickolas said. On the contrary: Over the next three days, McGrath became a national political sensation, a symbol of the wave of Democratic women running for office in the age of Trump. Comedian Sarah Silverman called her a \u201cbadass\u201d on Twitter. Chelsea Handler invited McGrath to appear on her show. More than 1 million people watched the video, and money \u2015 lots of money \u2015 began rolling in: McGrath raised more than $340,000 in the 72 hours after the commercial first aired. What the ad didn\u2019t do, however, was win over national Democrats \u2015 namely, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, which continued to recruit Gray. Neither did it push Gray out of the race: When he finally declared his candidacy in December, Gray held, according to McGrath\u2019s own internal polling, a 40-point lead. But handshake by handshake, McGrath quickly narrowed the gap. Going into Tuesday\u2019s primary, she was either fast on Gray\u2019s heels or out in front, depending on whose polling you believe, and the DCCC has quietly taken the position that either Democratic hopeful will have a strong chance to beat Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr in November.\u00a0 Ideologically speaking, there is little daylight between McGrath and Gray. The distinction between them lies mainly in affect and strategy, with McGrath continuing to push an outsider vs. insider narrative of the primary even as she seemed to become at least some of the insiders\u2019 preferred candidate. While she may well lose her primary, McGrath\u2019s campaign contains some lessons for a party desperate to flip districts like this one.\u00a0She unabashedly pandered to the sort of discontent that swept President Donald Trump into office, but she took care to hitch it to issues like jobs and health care \u2014 particularly to the efforts of her state\u2019s senior senator, Republican Mitch McConnell, to \u201ctake health care away from over a quarter-million Kentuckians.\u201d Grievance plus stuff. Stick that on your lawn sign.\u00a0 \u00a0 The challenge facing McGrath\u2019s campaign was immediately evident for any visitor to her campaign office near the University of Kentucky\u2019s campus in Lexington.\u00a0Her opponent had headquartered his 2016 campaign for Rand Paul\u2019s U.S. Senate seat out of the same office; across the drive, a small house still had a \u201cGray for U.S. Senate\u201d campaign sticker plastered on the front door. And though McGrath\u2019s initial ad had garnered her national attention, Gray still seemed like an obvious front-runner in the early months of the race: He\u00a0is the mayor of the district\u2019s biggest base of reliably Democratic votes and oversees a city with a 3 percent unemployment rate. He won the 19-county area by three points in the Senate race against Paul. And in a year when the DCCC is going for broke trying to gain the 24 seats it needs to regain the House majority, Gray is a bit of a luxury: a wealthy businessman in a marginally competitive district who has the ability to relieve financial pressure on the national party by self-financing at least part of his campaign. Gray also comes with progressive bona fides: A popular mayor who\u2019s transformed Lexington, he supported removing\u00a0the city\u2019s Confederate statues; he\u2019s a small-town Kentuckian who helped turn his family business into a construction giant; he\u2019s viewed favorably by\u00a077 percent of primary voters. He supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Obamacare; he touts a record of targeting utility monopolies that would seem to fit neatly into the new Democratic antitrust agenda. A win in the primary and again in November would make him the first openly gay congressman in Kentucky\u2019s history. But what would ordinarily be a compelling biography instead became something of a liability in an election year that has thus far favored political outsiders \u2015 especially when they\u2019re women. In Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nebraska and beyond, insurgent female candidates have knocked off more established opponents with stronger-on-paper political resumes, feeding off the sense that Americans (and especially Democrats) want a new generation of political leaders to emerge. So what Gray and national Democrats saw as strengths, McGrath and her team instantly pegged as weaknesses. Without much room to differentiate herself on the issues, McGrath instead chose to paint Gray as a favorite son of the national Democratic establishment, the hand-picked choice of Washington rather than of central Kentucky. \u201cI think people are hungry for new leaders, and a new generation of leaders,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re tired of the old guard. They want folks who aren\u2019t hand-picked.\u201d The characterization isn\u2019t exactly accurate: Aside from the Senate run, Gray\u2019s entire political career has been spent on the Lexington city council or in the mayor\u2019s office, and he\u2019s hardly been a prominent voice in statewide or national Democratic politics. But by playing up her status as an outsider \u2015 a veteran, a mother, a woman, three things she says there aren\u2019t enough of in Congress \u2015 McGrath\u2019s narrative has taken hold nonetheless, and her calls to shake up Congress have resonated strongly against Gray\u2019s safer, duller call to \u201csend some adult supervision to Washington.\u201d Yet as McGrath\u2019s national profile grew after her first ad, she remained relatively unknown and perhaps even a little suspect to Kentucky voters. A native of Edgewood in northern Kentucky, she\u2019d never lived in the central part of the state and had only relocated to the district in June, upon retiring from the U.S. Naval Academy.\u00a0 (Gray attempted to punch back on this point in the race\u2019s closing days, releasing an ad that hit McGrath for only recently moving to Kentucky. But groups like VoteVets, a nonprofit that promotes veteran candidates and their issues, have slammed the ad as an attempt to \u201cswift-boat\u201d McGrath\u2019s campaign.) Even before Gray entered the race, Nickolas, who had managed former Rep. Ben Chandler\u2019s (D) successful 6th District campaign in 2004, outlined an aggressive retail politicking strategy to get McGrath in front of voters \u2015 not just on TV, but in their homes, churches, billboards and mailboxes. Nickolas \u2015 who thought he was out of politics for good until Chandler urged him to meet with McGrath \u2015 said he was instantly swayed by her grasp of the issues and the realities of politics, which she had honed during stints working for Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif.) in Congress during her time in the military. Most of all, he was impressed by her passion, and he banked on his belief that if they had to chance to meet her, Kentucky voters would feel the same. McGrath, meanwhile, purchased ad space in every local newspaper in the district and published an editorial detailing why she had chosen to run now, in 2018, and here, in central Kentucky. She piggybacked off the popularity of the initial ad, which gained her thousands of social media followers, to hold Q&A\u2019s with voters in the district that were broadcast on Facebook. She hit all 19 counties in her first few months in the race, stumping across the region and spending hours, even days, in areas that had once been reliable Democratic strongholds but have trended red for more than a decade. In a district where Democrats still hold a registration advantage, she has pushed the message that the national party has abandoned its voters here. \u201cThe Democrats here feel left behind by the national party,\u201d she said. \u201cThe national party, to them,\u00a0is Washington D.C. They don\u2019t have the same values. They\u2019re led by San Francisco and New York. They don\u2019t see leaders from here or the Midwest. And they\u2019re focused on the wrong things.\u201d Led by San Francisco and New York. You don\u2019t need a decoder pin to understand what McGrath is getting at. But she goes no further. She doesn\u2019t counterpose issues of identity \u2014 transgender access to bathrooms, women\u2019s rights, race \u2014 against the economic concerns of white, working-class voters. McGrath is pro-choice. She\u2019s a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s efforts to ban transgender people from the military. She thinks his effort to ban refugees and immigrants from majority Muslim countries is discriminatory and misguided.  McGrath doesn\u2019t shy away from those issues when voters bring them up, and she believes her military service helps bridge the gap between the two sides when they do disagree. But she\u2019s primarily focused on what she sees as the concerns that the district\u2019s old-school Democrats who\u2019ve been voting Republican still share with the national party: chiefly, health care and the economy.  She has argued for not just protecting the Affordable Care Act but expanding it to include a public option and a lower age of eligibility for Medicare, against the Republican tax cut package for which incumbent Barr voted, and for raising the minimum wage. She describes herself as a \u201cfiscal conservative,\u201d but mostly to score points off of Barr for passing deficit-fattening tax cuts after years of fear-mongering on that very same issue.  And in a direct appeal to the rural parts of the district, she\u2019s advocated for an expansive role for the federal government, arguing that it should invest heavily in broadband, infrastructure, and job and economic development in areas left behind by the decline of manufacturing and the collapse of the coal industry. \u201cWe ought to have the federal government funding high-speed broadband in those areas. And we ought to do it for our country,\u201d McGrath argued during an interview in her Lexington campaign office. \u201cEisenhower didn\u2019t say, \u2018Let\u2019s let private industry build the highways.\u2019 No, the government did that. And it powered our country. FDR brought electricity to Appalachia. The federal government did that.\u201d McGrath speaks in a folksy, unpolished manner, with the occasional curse word slipping out, her voice rising and falling and sometimes cracking as she talks about the ugly direction the country she fought for has taken, or about Barr\u2019s vote to repeal the health care law that gave thousands of local residents coverage for the first time. \u201cThe average household income here in Kentucky is about $50,000. That\u2019s not a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you have Andy Barr coming in and saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to repeal Obamacare and give you health savings accounts\u2019 \u2015 dude, they don\u2019t have the money for health savings accounts.\u201d The more Kentuckians have gotten to see of McGrath, the more the message she\u2019s aiming for has set in.\u00a0 \u201cA lot of people say they want to shake things up. She\u2019s believable in that regard, just because of her demeanor,\u201d said Al Cross, a veteran Kentucky political journalist. \u201cShe comes across as somebody who wants to get things done and won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d That invocation of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, meanwhile, isn\u2019t an accident \u2015 it was the New Deal and the local economic populists who supported it, like former Kentucky Sen. (and Vice President) Alben Barkley, who painted the state blue a century ago. In a state where Democrats have continually lost ground over the last decade, McGrath is arguing that \u201cwe have to talk about the things that made these people Democrats in the first place,\u201d Cross said. \u201cFDR is the guy who confirmed people as Democrats. And Alben Barkley did too. And it\u2019s been a long time since either of those guys were around.\u201d Even before the polls began to shift, there were signs that the strategy was working. Last fall, McGrath traveled to Anderson County \u2015 one of the district\u2019s largest counties \u2015 to meet with Ben Carlson, the conservative editor of the local daily newspaper, the Anderson News. Carlson was impressed, not just by McGrath, but by the enthusiasm people had about her. \u201cI haven\u2019t sensed, in a congressional race, this kind of enthusiasm for a candidate in the 12 years I\u2019ve been running the paper. For either party,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cShe\u2019s brought that kind of excitement to it.\u201d To Nickolas, that\u2019s evidence that this sort of hyperlocal campaigning in districts where voters increasingly feel detached from both sides of the national debate can help Democrats win back seats.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a reminder that sometimes we get away from the fundamentals,\u201d Nickolas said. \u201cWe get seduced by the latest way of communicating. Too many campaigns put their money on TV and digital, and what suffers is the old school face-to-face communication with voters.\u201d McGrath\u2019s style of campaigning, Nickolas believes, is crucial for Democrats in purplish districts like Kentucky\u2019s 6th. The grievance gets people\u2019s attention; the stuff gets their votes. \u201cThey want to know: \u2018Are you going to go to Congress and represent me? Are you going to care about me?\u2019\u201d Nickolas said. \u201cShe leads with that: \u2018We may not agree on some of the issues. But you should believe that I\u2019m going to have your back.\u2019\u201d He continued: \u201cYou can be a progressive and still do well in more conservative areas, as long as those rural voters get a sense that you\u2019ll fight for them.\u201d'}.

But in doing so, they may have also cost their best player, the injured Kawhi Leonard, his chance at winning his first MVP Award. Lacking two of their biggest stars, a year after the franchise\u2019s best player retired, the Spurs closed out the Houston Rockets in six games on the road with a 39 point win in the Western Semifinal Series. In doing so, they held James Harden of the Houston Rockets to perhaps his worst game as a professional basketball player. And the statistics don\u2019t tell the whole tale. The highly-talented Harden of Houston looked confused and lost, making all kinds of turnovers and mental mistakes. In fact, the entire Rockets team looked as though they were stuck in a bad dream. That\u2019s because Houston was supposed to be the easy winners. They humiliated the Spurs early in the series to take away home court advantage. San Antonio had to play their best game just to win game 2, and then fight hard to take back the series initiative, winning one of two in Houston. In Game 5, ageless Argentinian Guard Manu Ginobili blocked a Harden three-point attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, helping his team manage a 110-107 win in overtime. But it was a costly night for San Antonio in Game 5. Already seeing future Hall-of-Fame point guard Tony Parker lost for the year with an injury, the Spurs lost Kawhi Leonard to an injury as well. That\u2019s why the team had to limp their way to a narrow win to take a three-to-two game lead in the best of seven series. Already, the pundits were writing off the Spurs. They predicted Ginobili\u2019s block to be more of a \u201clast gasp\u201d for the proud franchise\u2019s incredible run since Coach Greg Popovich took over. Other sportscasters noted that without Leonard for Game 6, and possibly Game 7, Houston was the favorite to win the series, and would provide the more intriguing matchup with the Golden State Warriors. Houston looked like they read too many of their headlines proclaiming themselves the favorite. And without Parker and Leonard, why not? What would they have to prepare for? But that\u2019s because they underestimated Greg Popovich, the talented but inconsistent LaMarcus Aldrdige, Pau Gasol, Jonathon Simmons, the ageless Manu Ginobili, Patty Mills and rookie guard Dejounte Murray. All are underrated, but they turned in an incredible performance. The team led by more than 20 points going into halftime, and kept their foot on the gas pedal the whole game in the 114-75 blowout. The Rockets looked more like SCUD Missile duds. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni looked as confused as his players by the Spurs outburst, led by Aldridge, who turned in a career game. Yet sadly, the Spurs may have lost their team leader, Kawhi Leonard, the MVP trophy. A top-notch defender, good scorer, and winner of the 2014 NBA Finals MVP, Leonard was considered a top 4 candidate (even the best candidate by many), along with Harden, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Stephen Curry of the Warriors. But just as the Spurs showed that Harden wasn\u2019t one of league\u2019s best, they also proved they could win without Leonard. Now it\u2019s a battle between James and Curry. However, the Spurs have put Leonard in a chance to win another NBA Finals MVP. If he can return from the injury, and his teammates play this well, it will be the Spurs hoisting the finals trophy for 2017, instead of the Warriors, Cavs or Boston Celtics. John A.

BAT, which already owned 42 percent of Reynolds, will pay $29.44 in cash and 0.5260 BAT shares for each Reynolds share, it said, a 26 percent premium over the price of the stock on Oct. 20, the day before BAT\u2019s first offer was made public. Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes, rejected the approach a month later, according to sources, although the two sides remained in talks. The deal, which values the whole of Reynolds at around $86 billion, will mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets. BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante said bringing the two companies together would create a market leader with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike, Camel and Pall Mall. \u201cIt will create a stronger, global tobacco and NGP (next generation products) business with direct access for our products across the most attractive markets in the world,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Analysts have said the takeover could spark further deals as Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco jostle for market share in an industry that is shrinking in the West as more people quit smoking. Durante said the combined group would have the largest global footprint of any tobacco group, with strong positions in both fast-growing emerging markets and lucrative Western countries. RBC Capital Markets said assuming BAT was able to achieve the annual cost savings of \u201cat least $400 million\u201d it has targeted, the deal would be financially neutral for BAT shares. \u201cWe think (the deal) makes sense strategically and operationally and just about washes its face financially,\u201d it said. \u201cThat said, a value-neutral acquisition does little to alter our view that the shares are already reasonably valued.\u201d Shares in BAT were up 0.4 percent at 47.80 pounds at 0855 GMT, about where they were trading in October before the company revealed its initial bid.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in federal court in the Western District of Washington, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents. The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request to comment. The government\u2019s actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and the First Amendment right to free speech. Microsoft\u2019s suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people's computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data. Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated. \u201cPeople do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,\u201d Microsoft says in the lawsuit, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. It adds that the government \u201chas exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.\u201d The lawsuit represents the newest front in the battle between technology companies and the U.S. government over how much private businesses should assist government surveillance. By filing the suit, Microsoft is taking a more prominent role in that battle, dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in recent months due to the government\u2019s efforts to get the company to write software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a December massacre in San Bernardino, California. Apple, backed by big technology companies including Microsoft, had complained that cooperating would turn businesses into arms of the state. In its complaint, Microsoft says over the past 18 months it has received 5,624 legal orders under the ECPA, of which 2,576 prevented Microsoft from disclosing that the government is seeking customer data through warrants, subpoenas and other requests. Most of the ECPA requests apply to individuals, not companies, and provide no fixed end date to the secrecy provision, Microsoft said. Microsoft and other companies won the right two years ago to disclose the number of government demands for data they receive. This case goes farther, requesting that it be allowed to notify individual businesses and people that the government is seeking information about them. Increasingly, U.S. companies are under pressure to prove they are helping protect consumer privacy. The campaign gained momentum in the wake of revelations by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 that the government routinely conducted extensive phone and Internet surveillance to a much greater degree than believed. Microsoft\u2019s lawsuit comes a day after a U.S. congressional panel voted unanimously to advance a package of reforms to the ECPA. Last-minute changes to the legislation removed an obligation for the government to notify a targeted user whose communications are being sought. Instead, the bill would require disclosure of a warrant only to a service provider, which retains the right to voluntarily notify users, unless a court grants a gag order. Republican leadership said it will bring the bill to a full vote in the House of Representatives in two weeks. After its expected passage, the bill will await Senate consideration. Separately, Microsoft is fighting a U.S. government warrant to turn over data held in a server in Ireland, which the government argues is lawful under another part of the ECPA. Microsoft argues the government needs to go through a procedure outlined in a legal assistance treaty between the U.S. and Ireland.

U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said the assets Shkreli could forfeit to satisfy the judgment also include $5 million in a brokerage account and his stake in Vyera Pharmaceuticals, one of the drug companies he founded. Shkreli is scheduled to be sentenced for securities fraud on Friday. A lawyer for Shkreli could not immediately be reached for comment on the judge\u2019s order. Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair in a Facebook post. Shkreli became notorious as the\u201cPharma Bro\u201d when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing is now Vyera. In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it. Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting. A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Shkreli\u2019s lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin. Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors\u2019 ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud. Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines.'}.

I am always talking about my feelings, and he is always listening. He \u201cmhm\u201ds at the right places and doesn\u2019t interrupt and sometimes says good things at the end. Sometimes he says wrong things, and then I have to explain why those things are wrong, taking us down an emotional tangent that is frustrating and exhausting, but he\u2019s trying to be helpful, I tell myself and breathe. Bless his little heart. But tonight, he lets me talk. And I do, filling the minutes with long, twisting sentences that make sense to me, but as they tumble out, I\u2019m not sure that they do, so I pause and I blurt, \u201cI\u2019m just not a white man!\u201d Or something like that. This was years ago, so who knows what really happened. I may not have been on Broadway at all. But that\u2019s where the anger ended, in not being white or a man or coding since I was two or some combination of the three. This wasn\u2019t going to work. Coding wasn\u2019t going to work. I didn\u2019t belong. Fast-forward three years. I\u2019d choked down my feelings and learned to code and built things and knew stuff that even my then-boyfriend-now-husband didn\u2019t know. We sat on our couch one evening while I explained how AJAX worked. He leaned back and I leaned in, excited and trembling at the edge of my seat. I heard the words coming out of my mouth, watched them float in the air between us, blooming with buzzwords and jargon and pride and I burst into tears. I covered my face with my hands, hunched over and shook. I couldn\u2019t believe I understood the words I was saying. This was going to work. Coding was going to work. Maybe I did belong. The cracks in that newly laid confidence would soon come, but not for reasons I may have lead you to believe. I apologize if you assumed this was a story about a difference rooted in race and gender, because it is not. That\u2019s not where we are going. This is about a difference of values, beliefs, perspectives. I wanted so badly to think like a programmer, which implies that the way I think is wrong. It needed fixing in many ways. This observation is frustratingly fuzzy, cloudy, unfocused, but I\u2019ve squeezed it hard enough to make raindrops, something I can taste and feel, and I shall give you three. I am not solution-oriented. I don\u2019t see a problem and get giddy at the idea of solving it, patching it up and sending it on its merry way. I want to poke it and ask it questions. Where did it come from, what is it doing, what\u2019s its story? I want to take it to tea and hear about its life and understand it to its core. And if, at that point, I\u2019ve come to a wholistic understanding and am able to solve the problem, by all means, let the problem-solving commence! But my instinct is never to solve, but to understand. This is the part where you tell me that this is a great asset in a programmer! That all programmers would be much better off if they took the time to understand before diving in! My thinking isn\u2019t broken at all, you say, it\u2019s super awesome! That\u2019s cute. And truly, I appreciate your defense of my broken brain. But no matter what Medium blog posts tell you how crucial it is to understand the problem before coding its solution, this is, at best, an annoying part of an average developer\u2019s job, and, more likely, a distant idea that is happily ignored. Developers solve problems. It is the problem-solving, not the problem-understanding, that gets you high. Hm. Maybe this isn\u2019t going to work. I am not comfortable making half-ass shit. Once in a while I look up the famous quote by Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, who said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late.\u201d I say it to myself. I say it again. I let it sit and turn it over and convince myself this isn\u2019t insane. I understand this concept at an intellectual level. I get the value of the MVP (minimum viable product) and was excited to learn the pseudo-scientific process of the lean methodology. The quote is a punchy way of encouraging product creators to start small and test an idea before investing loads of money and time in an expensive mistake. And this advice is great! You should start small and test and learn. But the way this advice manifests itself is often in writing shitty shit that makes shitty shit products, and leaving it in its shitty shit way. It\u2019s the shrug that accompanies the mindless defense, \u201cBut it works.\u201d It produces a mentality of doing the absolute bare minimum, not because it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the product or your team, but because, why bother to do more? It works! It condemns everything I\u2019ve learned and loved about craftsmanship and quality and just plain giving a fuck. There are no As here, there is only pass and fail. Maybe coding wasn\u2019t going to work. This is the part where you tell me that there is such a thing as beautiful code! There are talks that preach the value of well written code, books filled with advice on how to hone your craft, podcast interviews of developers raging against poorly written programs. My value of quality is wonderful, you say, do not fix it, you shout, keep going, you plead! That\u2019s cute. But no matter how many conference talks you\u2019ve tweeted about praising code as craft, open up your company\u2019s production-level app right now and tell me how much of that has made its way to your product. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait. Because in the real world of death marches, limited runway, and just plain old pressure from the higher ups, quality and care are a dream: sweet, distant, and rarely realized. But perhaps the biggest way that my brain is broken is less about code, and more about the tech industry as a whole. If you\u2019re thinking to yourself, \u201cBut everyone uses tech so everything is the tech industry,\u201d please sit tight while I take a moment to roll my eyes.\u00a0\u2026 Ok, I\u2019m back. For our purposes, let\u2019s define \u201ctech industry\u201d as companies and professionals who view code as a core part of their business and their self-understanding, both internally and externally. When I was at NPR years ago, I did a story on public education in California. I don\u2019t remember the angle, but I remember looking up a stat to use in the script. I used that stat in a few places, and after fact-checking, I realized there was an updated number available. I went back and changed the references to the new number, relieved that I\u2019d caught this mistake before handing over my script to the host. But I missed one. I heard it over the speakers when Michelle Martin, the host, read it out loud during the interview, and my heart stopped. I knew it was my duty to report it, so I went up to my editor and told her. She didn\u2019t say anything, but I could feel her disappointment in me. I melted into a pool of shame. But here\u2019s the thing. No one will ever remember that number. No one remembers it now, and I\u2019m sure no one noticed it when it happened. But I knew it happened, that it was an easily preventable mistake, and, in journalism, being wrong in that way is absolutely unacceptable. So imagine my surprise when I first heard of \u201cfail fast and break things,\u201d one of the famous tech mantras for product creation. Imagine my shock to find out that being wrong is not reprimanded, but, at times, encouraged. Imagine my confusion stepping into a world where people are told to \u201cjust try it and see.\u201d I tell myself over and over that this is different, that this is good, that public experimentation is not a holy sin. I\u2019ve managed to convince myself, when I\u2019m not busy quieting a nauseous tummy tormented by public broken attempts and shameful failures. But here, I will admit defeat. Being wrong in software is fundamentally different from being wrong in reporting. Except when it\u2019s not. When I use your product, I\u2019m trusting you. I believe you when you tell me that clicking that button will create my profile, that I am indeed submitting an email by hitting enter, that I will see my mom\u2019s message when I click on her little, round face. My belief in you is delicate and deep. Do not take my trust for granted. Do not take advantage of me. We are in a relationship, you and I. Distant and faceless, yes, but a relationship nonetheless. I give and you take and you give and I take, and I believe your words, your lines, your interfaces. It should be precious. It should be handled with care, but the carelessness I see in tech is unsettling. The willful ignorance, the rejection of our relationship, hurts. It might come big, like playing with my emotions by purposefully filling my feed with sad or happy content, just to see how I respond. It might come small, like your claim of being the number one this-and-that in your this-and-that field, according to\u00a0\u2026 no one. You are so proud of your accomplishments and so comfortable in your grandeur that you forget to be honest with me. Sometimes it comes deep, like spending months together trying to solve a problem you promised me you could solve to later find out that you got it all wrong, you made it all up, you have no idea what you\u2019re doing. You brag about this in your interviews and inevitable autobiography. For some strange reason, you wear this ignorance as a badge of honor. You failed fast and broke my heart. But you will never see it that way. You\u2019re too excited. I feel you whisper make the world a better place as you drift to sleep, so obsessed with changing it that you forget that the world is made up of little people like me. You are experimenting, trying new things, and for this, you are great and lean. But sometimes, you forget that I\u2019m at the center of your experiments. Sometimes, you forget me. I take these relationships seriously. So seriously that often I\u2019m immobilized and overwhelmed. And in those moments, you push products I\u2019m too uncomfortable to push and you win. You get there first, making waves while I sit in last place and watch. So I choke down my values and discomfort and attempt a push of my own, amid the internal screams that this is wrong and irresponsible and how dare I. I don\u2019t get very far. My feeble, half-hearted steps cannot compete with your bold, proud strides. So I cower back to my corner with my broken brain and peep at your success through the leaves. I do not belong. My values are not valued. My thinking is strange and foreign. My world view has no place here. It is not that I am better, it is that I am different, and my difference feels incompatible with yours, dear tech. So I will mark my corner, a small plot of land and stand firmly here, trying to understand you and reconcile these conflicting differences. Maybe I will change. Maybe you\u2019ll surprise me. Maybe, one day, I\u2019ll belong'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

By Tom Engelhardt [This essay is the introduction to Tom Engelhardt\u2019s new book, A Nation Unmade by War, a Dispatch Book published by Haymarket Books.] As I was putting the finishing touches on my new book, the Costs of War Project at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute published an estimate of the taxpayer dollars that will have gone into America\u2019s war on terror from September 12, 2001, through fiscal year 2018. That figure: a cool $5.6 trillion (including the future costs of caring for our war vets). On average, that\u2019s at least $23,386 per taxpayer. Keep in mind that such figures, however eye-popping, are only the dollar costs of our wars. They don\u2019t, for instance, include the psychic costs to the Americans mangled in one way or another in those never-ending conflicts. They don\u2019t include the costs to this country\u2019s infrastructure, which has been crumbling while taxpayer dollars flow copiously and in a remarkably \u2015 in these years, almost uniquely \u2015 bipartisan fashion into what\u2019s still laughably called \u201cnational security.\u201d That\u2019s not, of course, what would make most of us more secure, but what would make them \u2015 the denizens of the national security state \u2015 ever more secure in Washington and elsewhere. We\u2019re talking about the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. nuclear complex, and the rest of that state-within-a-state, including its many intelligence agencies and the warrior corporations that have, by now, been fused into that vast and vastly profitable interlocking structure. In reality, the costs of America\u2019s wars, still spreading in the Trump era, are incalculable. Just look at photos of the cities of Ramadi or Mosul in Iraq, Raqqa or Aleppo in Syria, Sirte in Libya, or Marawi in the southern Philippines, all in ruins in the wake of the conflicts Washington set off in the post\u20139/11 years, and try to put a price on them. Those views of mile upon mile of rubble, often without a building still standing untouched, should take anyone\u2019s breath away. Some of those cities may never be fully rebuilt. And how could you even begin to put a dollars-and-cents value on the larger human costs of those wars: the hundreds of thousands of dead? The tens of millions of people displaced in their own countries or sent as refugees fleeing across any border in sight? How could you factor in the way those masses of uprooted peoples of the Greater Middle East and Africa are unsettling other parts of the planet? Their presence (or more accurately a growing fear of it) has, for instance, helped fuel an expanding set of right-wing \u201cpopulist\u201d movements that threaten to tear Europe apart. And who could forget the role that those refugees \u2015 or at least fantasy versions of them \u2015 played in Donald Trump\u2019s full-throated, successful pitch for the presidency? What, in the end, might be the cost of that? Opening the Gates of Hell America\u2019s never-ending twenty-first-century conflicts were triggered by the decision of George W. Bush and his top officials to instantly define their response to attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center by a tiny group of jihadis as a \u201cwar\u201d; then to proclaim it nothing short of a \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d; and finally to invade and occupy first Afghanistan and then Iraq, with dreams of dominating the Greater Middle East \u2015 and ultimately the planet \u2015 as no other imperial power had ever done. Their overwrought geopolitical fantasies and their sense that the U.S. military was a force capable of accomplishing anything they willed it to do launched a process that would cost this world of ours in ways that no one will ever be able to calculate. Who, for instance, could begin to put a price on the futures of the children whose lives, in the aftermath of those decisions, would be twisted and shrunk in ways frightening even to imagine? Who could tote up what it means for so many millions of this planet\u2019s young to be deprived of homes, parents, educations \u2015 of anything, in fact, approximating the sort of stability that might lead to a future worth imagining? Though few may remember it, I\u2019ve never forgotten the 2002 warning issued by Amr Moussa, then head of the Arab League. An invasion of Iraq would, he predicted that September, \u201copen the gates of hell.\u201d Two years later, in the wake of the actual invasion and the U.S. occupation of that country, he altered his comment slightly. \u201cThe gates of hell,\u201d he said, \u201care open in Iraq.\u201d His assessment has proven unbearably prescient \u2015 and one not only applicable to Iraq. Fourteen years after that invasion, we should all now be in some kind of mourning for a world that won\u2019t ever be. It wasn\u2019t just the US military that, in the spring of 2003, passed through those gates to hell. In our own way, we all did. Otherwise, Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t have become president. I don\u2019t claim to be an expert on hell. I have no idea exactly what circle of it we\u2019re now in, but I do know one thing: we are there. The Infrastructure of a Garrison State If I could bring my parents back from the dead right now, I know that this country in its present state would boggle their minds. They wouldn\u2019t recognize it. If I were to tell them, for instance, that just three men \u2015 Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett \u2015 now possess as much wealth as the bottom half of the US population, of 160 million Americans, they would never believe me. How, for instance, could I begin to explain to them the ways in which, in these years, money flowed ever upward into the pockets of the immensely wealthy and then down again into what became one-percent elections that would finally ensconce a billionaire and his family in the White House? How would I explain to them that, while leading congressional Democrats and Republicans couldn\u2019t say often enough that this country was uniquely greater than any that ever existed, none of them could find the funds \u2015 some $5.6 trillion for starters \u2015 necessary for our roads, dams, bridges, tunnels and other crucial infrastructure? This on a planet where what the news likes to call \u201cextreme weather\u201d is increasingly wreaking havoc on that same infrastructure. My parents wouldn\u2019t have thought such things possible. Not in America. And somehow I\u2019d have to explain to them that they had returned to a nation which, though few Americans realize it, has increasingly been unmade by war \u2015 by the conflicts Washington\u2019s war on terror triggered that have now morphed into the wars of so many and have, in the process, changed us. Such conflicts on the global frontiers have a tendency to come home in ways that can be hard to track or pin down. After all, unlike those cities in the Greater Middle East, ours aren\u2019t yet in ruins \u2015 though some of them may be heading in that direction, even if in slow motion. This country is, at least theoretically, still near the height of its imperial power, still the wealthiest nation on the planet. And yet it should be clear enough by now that we\u2019ve crippled not just other nations but ourselves in ways that I suspect \u2015 though I\u2019ve tried over these years to absorb and record them as best I could \u2015 we can still barely see or grasp. In my new book, A Nation Unmade by War, the focus is on a country increasingly unsettled and transformed by spreading wars to which most of its citizens were, at best, only half paying attention. Certainly, Trump\u2019s election was a sign of how an American sense of decline had already come home to roost in the era of the rise of the national security state (and little else). Though it\u2019s not something normally said here, to my mind President Trump should be considered part of the costs of those wars come home. Without the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and what followed, I doubt he would have been imaginable as anything but the host of a reality TV show or the owner of a series of failed casinos. Nor would the garrison-state version of Washington he now occupies be conceivable, nor the generals of our disastrous wars whom he\u2019s surrounded himself with, nor the growth of a surveillance state that would have staggered George Orwell. The Makings of a Blowback Machine It took Donald Trump \u2015 give him credit where it\u2019s due \u2015 to make us begin to grasp that we were living in a different and devolving world. And none of this would have been imaginable if, in the aftermath of 9/11, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney & Co. hadn\u2019t felt the urge to launch the wars that led us through those gates of hell. Their soaring geopolitical dreams of global domination proved to be nightmares of the first order. They imagined a planet unlike any in the previous half millennium of imperial history, in which a single power would basically dominate everything until the end of time. They imagined, that is, the sort of world that, in Hollywood, had been associated only with the most malign of evil characters. And here was the result of their conceptual overreach: never, it could be argued, has a great power still in its imperial prime proven quite so incapable of applying its military and political might in a way that would advance its aims. It\u2019s a strange fact of this century that the U.S. military has been deployed across vast swaths of the planet and somehow, again and again, has found itself overmatched by underwhelming enemy forces and incapable of producing any results other than destruction and further fragmentation. And all of this occurred at the moment when the planet most needed a new kind of knitting together, at the moment when humanity\u2019s future was at stake in ways previously unimaginable, thanks to its still-increasing use of fossil fuels. In the end, the last empire may prove to be an empire of nothing at all \u2015 a grim possibility which has been a focus of TomDispatch, the website I\u2019ve run since November 2002. Of course, when you write pieces every couple of weeks for years on end, it would be surprising if you didn\u2019t repeat yourself. The real repetitiousness, however, wasn\u2019t at TomDispatch. It was in Washington. The only thing our leaders and generals have seemed capable of doing, starting from the day after the 9/11 attacks, is more or less the same thing with the same dismal results, again and again. The U.S. military and the national security state that those wars emboldened have become, in effect \u2015 and with a bow to the late Chalmers Johnson (a TomDispatch stalwart and a man who knew the gates of hell when he saw them) \u2015 a staggeringly well-funded blowback machine. In all these years, while three administrations pursued the spreading war on terror, America\u2019s conflicts in distant lands were largely afterthoughts to its citizenry. Despite the largest demonstrations in history aimed at stopping a war before it began, once the invasion of Iraq occurred, the protests died out and, ever since, Americans have generally ignored their country\u2019s wars, even as the blowback began. Someday, they will have no choice but to pay attention.

Unless you married your high school sweetheart, we have all done it.  And it hurts.  It is never easy to give up on the hope you shared as a couple -- the dreams, your favorite song and shared possessions.  Building a life together holds so much promise.   But break-ups happen all the time and we find ways to move on and survive. We all understand this and do what is best for us during these difficult transitions.  We make choices to make our lives better for the future. I think it is time to admit that as a society we need to break up with our bad boyfriend, carbon.  According to the most recent report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we are already seeing the impacts on climate from greenhouse gas pollution on all continents and oceans.  According to many, including noted climate scientist Michael Mann, we will continue to see significant changes into the future with warming of up to several degrees in many areas of the world within a few decades. We should have listened to our wise uncles of previous generations who warned us about our abusive carbon-based boyfriend. Now it is too late to avoid some of the problems of global climate change.  The carbon we have emitted over the last century is still acting to warm our atmosphere and will continue to harass us. But we could at least break up now to avoid long-term damage.   I know it is hard to do.  We all love the ease of our carbon-based energy system lubricated by shaft and open pit mines, fracking drills, and high-tension wires.  We know we need to give all this up to make our world a better place for our children. I also know that some of our best friends and cousins are telling us that carbon is not all that bad for us.  They do not want us to break up.  However, to whom are you going to listen to on issues of global climate change? All the scientists of the world, or your friend or cousin? If we were honest with ourselves, we would admit that we have been on a slow break-up with carbon for years.  We've been toying with building a life with other energy sources, such as wind and solar, but we have not really thought of them as serious long-term partners, mainly because of their maturity levels -- even with decades of relationship problems with carbon such as wars over oil, mountain top removal, oil spills and fracking.  Our current greenhouse gas problem is finally urging us into the arms of another beau.  To date, green forms of energy account for just a fraction of our nation's energy production.  But that would change if we finally ended our relationship with carbon.  We know that there are many fish in the sea.  We have not flirted seriously with wave and tidal energy, algal fuels, and other forms of green energy. Plus wind and solar are starting to mature and look like serious boyfriend material after their more eccentric hippie years. At this point, we all know that our boyfriend carbon is bad for us and nothing good will come from our relationship over the next several decades.  The question is whether we have the courage to take a leap to seek a new relationship.   Whatever we do, I know that a break-up is the right thing for the children.'}.

Google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws - one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. That raised the prospect of Intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, driving the company\u2019s shares down. But Intel said in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed on Thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time. It said Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches.\u00a0 \u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,\u201d it said. The company confirmed that the flaws reported by the researchers could allow hackers to steal information from computers, phones and other devices, but insisted that the issue was not a design flaw. The chipmaker said it would require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix the issue. Microsoft and Google have said they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers. Apple said in a separate statement late on Thursday that its tests showed patches would not significantly affect processing speeds. \u201cOur testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the December 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of macOS and iOS ... or in common Web browsing benchmarks,\u201d the California-based firm said. \u00a0 CERT, the cyber security project at Carnegie Mellon University sponsored by the U.S. government, on Friday withdrew its recommendation for the replacement of the central processing units (CPUs) of affected systems. In the updated guidance, CERT said \u201coperating system and some application updates mitigate these attacks.\u201d Daniel Gruss, the 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria\u2019s Graz Technical University who discovered the Meltdown flaw, welcomed Intel\u2019s white paper on the issue. \u201cThis looks much more professional now,\u201d Gruss said in comments emailed to Reuters. On the change in recommendation from CERT, Gruss said, however, that there were no replacements yet that could address the flaws in processors that he and other researchers have found. \u201cAll CPUs are affected, also very recent ones,\u201d Gruss said. \u201cFurthermore, software updates can fix most of the problems, leaving only a small remaining attack surface.\u201d Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp\u2019s Firefox confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may not have secure means of web browsing until Apple issues its patch. Apple said it would release a patch for the Safari web browser on its devices within days. It said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date. \u00a0 (Writing by Abinaya Vijayaraghavan; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Patrick Graham)'}.

Trump indicated\u00a0last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday\u2019s announcement at the White House.\u00a0 Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world,\u00a0died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act,\u00a0which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an \u201cimmoral purpose.\u201d \u201cJohnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cHe was treated very rough, very tough.\u201d The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time. This marks only the third posthumous pardon in U.S. history. In 2016,\u00a0Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),\u00a0now-retired Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to pardon Johnson for his \u201cimproper and unfair\u201d conviction.\u00a0 \u201cWhile it is unfortunate that this unjust conviction was not corrected during the boxer\u2019s lifetime, a posthumous pardon today represents the opportunity to reaffirm Jack Johnson\u2019s substantial contributions to our society and right this historical wrong,\u201d the lawmakers wrote at the time. Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.\u00a0 Trump disparaged Obama at Thursday\u2019s announcement for not issuing the pardon, but others said issuing clemency for Johnson is merely a symbolic move that falls short of addressing present-day racism in the criminal justice system.\u00a0 Though Obama granted clemency to nearly 2,000 people under an initiative aimed largely at commuting sentences of nonviolent drug-law offenders, his administration was unable to address the nearly 8,000 additional petitions that remained at the end of his term, Kevin Blackistone, a professor and sports commentator, wrote in The Washington Post last month.\u00a0 Unlike Johnson, \u201d[t]hey are of living, breathing people\u00a0... with children, spouses, partners and futures that can be regained and realized with a second chance.\u201d\u00a0 Those remaining petitions, he noted, \u201cwere left behind in a file, as is customary historic practice, for the review of the next president.\u201d The previous presidents to issue posthumous pardons were Bill Clinton in 1999 and George W. Bush in 2008. Clinton pardoned Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black West Point graduate who years later was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer. Bush pardoned Charlie Winters, who had been convicted of violating the Neutrality Act by helping Israel obtain bomber planes in 1948. The pardon of Johnson was the fourth of Trump\u2019s term. He previously pardoned former Dick Cheney advisor Scooter Libby, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and a case of Navy sailor whose\u00a0pardon request was promoted on Fox News. So far, there\u2019s been no indication that any of his pardons have gone through the standard procedure through the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which evaluates requests for pardons and clemency and makes recommendations to the president.\u00a0 This story has been updated with details of the previous posthumous pardons. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated President Barack Obama pardoned nearly 2,000 people.\u00a0In fact, that number reflects the total of both pardons and commutations he granted.'}.

Despite all the negative political-related news, there were 10 tech trends this year that positively transformed humanity. For this \u201c2017 Kick-Off\u201d blog, I reviewed 52 weeks of science and technology breakthroughs, and categorized them into the top 10 tech trends changing our world. I\u2019m blown away by how palpable the feeling of exponential change has become. I\u2019m also certain that 99.999 percent of humanity doesn\u2019t understand or appreciate the ramifications of what is coming. In this blog, enjoy the top 10 tech trends of the past 12 months and why they are important to you. (NOTE: at the end of this blog, I provide a detailed reference for all of the new items below). Let\u2019s dive in\u2026 In 2010, 1.8 billion people were connected. Today, that number is about 3 billion, and by 2022 \u2013 2025, that number will expand to include every human on the planet, approaching 8 billion humans. Unlike when I was connected 20 years ago at 9,600 baud via AOL, the world today is coming online at 1 megabit per second or greater, with access to the world\u2019s information on Google, access to the world\u2019s products on Amazon, access to massive computing power on AWS and artificial intelligence with Watson\u2026 not to mention crowdfunding for capital and crowdsourcing for expertise. Looking back at 2016, you can feel the acceleration. Here are seven stories that highlight the major advances in our race for global connectivity: a) Google\u2019s 5G Solar Drones Internet Service: Project Skybender is Google\u2019s secretive 5G Internet drone initiative. News broke this year that they have been testing these solar-powered drones at Spaceport America in New Mexico to explore ways to deliver high-speed Internet from the air. Their purported millimeter wave technology could deliver data from drones up to 40 times faster than 4G. b) Facebook\u2019s Solar Drone Internet Service: Even before Google, Facebook has been experimenting with a solar-powered drone, also for the express purpose of providing Internet to billions. The drone has the wingspan of an airliner and flies with roughly the power of three blowdryers. c) ViaSat Plans 1 Terabit Internet Service: ViaSat, a U.S.-based satellite company, has teamed up with Boeing to launch three satellites to provide 1 terabit-per-second Internet connections to remote areas, aircraft and maritime vehicles. ViaSat is scheduled to launch its satellite ViaSat2 in early 2017. d) OneWeb Raises $1.2B for 900 Satellite Constellation: An ambitious low-Earth Orbit satellite system proposed by my friends Greg Wyler, Paul Jacobs and Richard Branson just closed $1.2 billion in financing. This 900-satellite system will offer global Internet services as soon as 2019. e) Musk Announces 4,425 Internet Satellite System: Perhaps the most ambitious plan for global Internet domination was proposed this year by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, with plans for SpaceX to deploy a 4,425 low-Earth orbit satellite system to blanket the entire planet in broadband. We\u2019ve just exceeded a historic inflection point. 2016 was the year solar and renewable energy became cheaper than coal. In December, the World Economic Forum reported that solar and wind energy is now the same price or cheaper than new fossil fuel capacity in more than 30 countries. \u201cAs prices for solar and wind power continue their precipitous fall, two-thirds of all nations will reach the point known as \u201cgrid parity\u201d within a few years, even without subsidies,\u201d they added. This is one of the most important developments in the history of humanity, and this year marked a number of major milestones for renewable energy. Here\u2019s 10 data points (stories) I\u2019ve hand-picked to hammer home the historic nature of this 2016 achievement. a) 25 percent of the world\u2019s power comes from renewables: REN21, a global renewable energy policy network, published a report showing that a quarter of the world\u2019s power now comes from renewable energy. International investment in renewable energy reached $286 billion last year (with solar accounting for over $160b of this), and it\u2019s accelerating. b) In India, solar is now cheaper than coal: An amazing milestone indeed, and India is now on track to deploy >100 gigawatts of solar power by 2022. c) The UK is generating more energy from solar than coal: For the first time in history, this year the U.K. has produced an estimated 6,964 GWh of electricity from solar cells, 10 percent higher than the 6,342 GWh generated by coal. d) Coal plants being replaced by solar farms: The Nanticoke Generating Station in Ontario, once North America\u2019s largest coal plant, will be turned into a solar farm. e) Coal will never recover: The coal industry, once the backbone of U.S. energy, is fading fast on account of renewables like solar and wind. Official and expert reports now state that it will never recover (e.g. coal power generation in Texas is down from 39 percent in early 2015 to 24.8 percent in May 2016). f) Scotland generated 106 percent energy from wind: This year, high winds boosted renewable energy output to provide 106 percent of Scotland\u2019s electricity needs for a day. g) Costa Rica ran on renewables for 2+ months: The country ran on 100 percent renewable energy for 76 days. h) Google to run 100 percent on renewable energy: Google has announced its entire global business will be powered by renewable energy in 2017. i) City of\u00a0Las Vegas meets goal of 100 percent power by renewables: Las Vegas\u2019s city government now runs entirely on renewable energy. j) Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory: Tesla\u2019s $5 billion structure in Nevada will produce 500,000 lithium ion batteries annually and Tesla\u2019s Model III vehicle. It is now over 30 percent complete\u2026 the 10 million square foot structure is set to be done by 2020. Musk projected that a total of 100 Gigafactories could provide enough storage capacity to run the entire planet on renewables. Though it may seem hard to believe, the end of cancer and disease is near. Scientists and researchers have been working diligently to find novel approaches to combating these diseases, and 2016 saw some extraordinary progress in this regard. Here are my top 10 picks that give me great faith about our abilities to cure cancer and most diseases: a) Cancer immunotherapy makes strides (extraordinary results): Immunotherapy involves using a patient\u2019s own immune system (in this case, T cells) to fight cancer. Doctors remove immune cells from patients, tag them with \u201creceptor\u201d molecules that target the specific cancer, and then infuse the cells back in the body. During the study, 94 percent of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) saw symptoms vanish completely. Patients with other blood cancers had response rates greater than 80 percent, and more than half experienced complete remission. b) In China, CRISPR/Cas9 used in first human trial: A team of scientists in China (Sichuan University) became the first to treat a human patient with an aggressive form of lung cancer with the groundbreaking CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique. c) NIH approves human trials using CRISPR: A team of physicians at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s School of Medicine had their project of modifying the immune cells of 18 different cancer patients with the CRISPR-Cas9 system approved by the National Institute of Health. Results are TBD. d) Giant Leap in treatment of diabetes from Harvard: For the first time, Harvard stem cell researchers created \u201cinsulin producing\u201d islet cells to cure diabetes in mice. This offers a promising cure in humans as well. e) HIV genes cut out of live animals using CRISPR: Scientists at the Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Center at Temple University were able to successfully cut out the HIV genes from live animals, and they had over a 50 percent success rate. f) New treatment causes HIV infected cells to vanish: A team of scientists in the U.K. discovered a new treatment for HIV. The patient was treated with vaccines that helped the body recognize the HIV-infected cells. Then, the drug Vorinostat was administered to activate the dormant cells so they could be spotted by the immune system. g) CRISPR cures mice of Sickle Cell Disease: CRISPR was used to completely cure sickle cell by editing the errant DNA sequence in mice. The treatment may soon be used to cure this disease, which affects about 100,000 Americans. h) Eradicating Measles (in the U.S.): The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that after 50 years, they have successfully eradicated measles in the U.S. This is one of the most contagious diseases around the world. i) New Ebola vaccine proved to be 100 percent effective: None of the nearly 6,000 individuals vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV in Guinea, a country with more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Ebola, showed any signs of contracting the disease. j) Eradicating Polio: The World Health Organization has announced that it expects to fully eradicate polio worldwide by Early 2017. I am personally convinced that we are on the verge of significantly impacting human longevity. At a minimum, making \u201c100 years old the new 60,\u201d as we say at Human Longevity Inc. This year, hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into research initiatives and companies focused on extending life. Here are five of the top stories from 2016 in longevity research: a) 400-Year-old shark discovered: A Greenland shark that could have been over 400 years old was discovered this year, making the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world. b) Genetically reversing aging: With an experiment that replicated stem cell-like conditions, Salk Institute researchers made human skin cells in a dish look and behave young again, and mice with premature aging disease were rejuvenated with a 30 percent increase in lifespan. The Salk Institute expects to see this work in human trials in less than 10 years. c) 25 percent life extension based on removal of senescent cells: Published in the medical journal Nature, cell biologists Darren Baker and Jan van Deursen have found that systematically removing a category of living, stagnant cells can extend the life of mice by 25 percent. d) Funding for anti-aging startups: Jeff Bezos and the Mayo Clinic-backed Anti-Aging Startup Unity Biotechnology with $116 million. The company will focus on medicines to slow the effects of age-related diseases by removing senescent cells (as mentioned in the article above). e) Young blood experiments show promising results for longevity: Sakura Minami and her colleagues at Alkahest, a company specializing in blood-derived therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, have found that simply injecting older mice with the plasma of young humans twice a week improved the mice\u2019s cognitive functions as well as their physical performance. This practice has seen a 30 percent increase in lifespan, and increase in muscle tissue and cognitive function. I\u2019ve increasingly become confident and passionate about stem cells, the regenerative engine of the body, to help cure disease and extend the healthy human lifespan. I previously wrote about stem cells and the incredible work from Dr. Robert (Bob) Hariri here. Below are my top three stories demonstrating the incredible research and implications for stem cells in 2016: a) Stem cells able to grow new human eyes: Biologists led by Kohji Nishida at Osaka University in Japan have discovered a new way to nurture and grow the tissues that make up the human eyeball. The scientists are able to grow retinas, corneas, the eye\u2019s lens, and more using only a small sample of adult skin. b) Stem cell injections help stroke victims walk again: In a study out of Stanford, of 18 stroke victims who agreed to stem cells treatments, seven of them showed remarkable motor function improvements. This treatment could work for other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. c) Stem cells help paralyzed victim gain use of arms: Doctors from the USC Neurorestoration Center and Keck Medicine of USC injected stem cells into the damaged cervical spine of a recently paralyzed 21-year-old man. Three months later, he showed dramatic improvement in sensation and movement of both arms. 2016 was definitely the year of the autonomous vehicle. As Google, Tesla and Uber lead the charge, almost every major car company is investing heavily in autonomy. This will be one of the defining technology developments of the decade \u2015 soon we may well look back in shock that we ever let humans drive cars on their own\u2026 In looking back at the last 12 months, here are the top nine developments in self-driving cars: a) Autonomous Uber operational in Pittsburgh: Uber\u2019s self-driving autonomous cars began picking up passengers in Pittsburgh this year. They also attempted a rollout in San Francisco. b) Uber\u2019s self-driving trucks made a delivery of 50,000 beers: This year, Uber acquired autonomous truck company Otto, and the retrofitted 18-wheeler made its first delivery\u2026 50,000 cans of Budweiser. c) Every Tesla Will Be Fully Autonomous in 2017: Elon Musk announced that all new Tesla cars will have Level 5 autonomy. This means that by 2017, Tesla cars will be fully capable of driving themselves with zero interaction from a human driver. d) Ford targets 2021 for autonomous vehicle release: Ford announces intention to deliver high-volume, fully autonomous vehicle for ridesharing in 2021. e) GM\u2019s first fully autonomous car: The company plans to bring its fully electric self-driving cars to the masses by launching its first driverless cars on Lyft. f) Google creates Waymo to support self-driving car technology: Google spun out its self-driving car unit as its own separate entity called Waymo. g) Google plans ride-sharing service with Chrysler: Google will deploy a semi-autonomous version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan by as soon as the end of 2017. h) Autonomy will kill car ownership: A former Tesla and BMW exec said that self-driving cars would start to kill car ownership in just five years. John Zimmer, the cofounder and president of Lyft, said in September that car ownership would \u201call but end\u201d in cities by 2025. i) Self-Driving Tractors Hit Farms: The self-driving tractors can deliver faster, more precise results than their human-controlled counterparts. Quadcopters and multicopters big and small made huge strides in 2016. We are headed towards a world where autonomous drones will image the world at millimeter resolution, deliver products and packages, and transport humans to remote areas that were previously inaccessible by roads. Here were the top six drone and \u201cflying car\u201d developments this year: a) Amazon Prime Air Made Its First Delivery: Amazon\u2019s drone delivery program \u201cPrime Air\u201d made its first delivery in the U.K. this year. Expect a much bigger rollout in 2017. b) The 7-11 convenience store leads: Convenience store 7-11 made 77 drone deliveries this year, beating Amazon by a long shot. c) Mercedes commits $500M to drone delivery: Mercedes-Benz vans and drone tech startup Matternet have created a concept car called a Vision Van. The van\u2019s rooftop serves as a launch and landing pad for Matternet\u2019s new M2 drones. d) Larry Page funding flying cars: Reports this year suggest Google cofounder Larry Page has been personally funding a pair of startups devoted to creating flying cars. He has purportedly put over $100 million into the ventures. e) 1,000 organ transplant deliveries from drone ordered: Last year we saw Chinese company eHang announce the first human-carrying drone. Recently, United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt announced a deal to fund 1,000 retrofitted eHang drones to provide organ deliveries to transplant patients, as part of Rothblatt\u2019s Manufactured Organ Transport Helicopter (MOTH) system. f) Uber launched its Elevate program: Global transportation giant Uber announced its plans to enter the \u201cflying car\u201d service arena by publishing a massive whitepaper this year detailing its plan to launch an \u201con demand aviation\u201d service called Uber Elevate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most important technology humanity will ever develop. I believe AI is a massive opportunity for humanity, not a threat. Broadly, AI is the ability of a computer to understand your question, to search its vast memory banks, and to give you the best, most accurate answer. AI will also help humanity fundamentally solve its grandest challenges. You may think of early versions of AI as Siri on your iPhone, or IBM\u2019s Watson supercomputer, but what is coming is truly awesome. Here are 10 of the most important stories for the past year: a) NVIDIA revealed a deep-learning computer chipset: The Tesla P100, Nvidia\u2019s newly announced 15-billion-transistor chip, is designed specifically for deep-learning A.I. technology. Hardware advances like this are rapidly accelerating AI developments. b) $5M IBM Watson AI XPRIZE: The XPRIZE Foundation and IBM Watson, in partnership with TED, announced a $5M purse for the team able to develop an AI that can collaborate with humans to solve grand challenges. The top three teams will compete on the TED stage in the spring of 2020. c) AIs can read your lips: A new AI lip reader out of Oxford called LipNet was built to process whole sentences at a time. LipNet was 1.78 times more accurate than human lip readers in translating the same sentences. d) AI\u2019s predict election better than humans: MogIA, an AI system developed by an Indian startup, correctly predicted the outcome of this year\u2019s elections. It based its analysis on 20 million data points from platforms such as Google, Twitter and YouTube. e) AI System beats 500-to-1 odds, predicts the Kentucky Derby trifecta: A startup called Unanimous AI built a swarm system in which individuals within a group influence each other\u2019s decision making. The swarm correctly predicted the top four finishers \u2013 known as a superfecta \u2013 beating 540 to 1 odds. f) Microsoft speech recognition tech scores better than humans: Microsoft\u2019s new speech recognition technology is able to transcribe conversational speech as well as (or even better than) humans. The technology scored a word error rate (WER) of 5.9 percent. g) AI-Written novel passes first round of literary award: Titled \u2018The Day A Computer Writes A Novel,\u2019 the short story was a team effort between human authors, led by Hitoshi Matsubara from the Future University Hakodate, and, well, a computer. h) AI saves woman\u2019s life: Reports assert that Japanese doctors have, for the first time in history, used artificial intelligence from IBM\u2019s Watson system to detect a rare type of leukemia, helping to save a patient\u2019s life. i) AI\u2019s beat human pilot in air combat: Retired United States Air Force Colonel Gene Lee recently went up against ALPHA, an artificial intelligence developed by a University of Cincinnati doctoral graduate in a high-fidelity air combat simulator. The Colonel lost to the AI. j) Deep Mind beats world\u2019s GO champion: The Go-playing AI \u201cAlphaGo\u201d from Google\u2019s DeepMind beat the reigning Go world champion, winning the five-game series 4-1 overall. This is a major achievement in the field of AI and deep learning. This year saw a number of fundamental achievements in physics, as well as a number of notable discoveries in our quest to explore the cosmos. Here are the top three stories for your consideration: a) Gravitational Waves Confirmed: After decades of searching, scientists have succeeded in detecting gravitational waves from the violent merger of two massive black holes. b) Evidence found for \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d: This year, more evidence arose suggesting there is, in fact, another giant, icy planet circling at the edges of our solar system. c) Earth-size planet around Proxima Centauri: A new planet that bears striking similarities to our own planet prompts remarkable inroads into the study of space. This also brings a new area to search for the possibility of extraterrestrial life. We are living during the birth of the commercial space era, driven by passionate billionaire backers. Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, Planetary Resources and various teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE are building commercial rockets and spacecraft to explore the cosmos. It is an incredibly exciting time for commercial space \u2013 here are the top four developments from the past 12 months. a) Bezos announced \u2018New Glenn\u2019: Jeff Bezos announced a massive new reusable rocket family in development for his private spaceflight company Blue Origin. The rocket, called New Glenn, will be used to launch satellites and people into space, according to Bezos. b) Four companies sign private contracts to fly to moon in 2017: The teams are competing to win the $20 million Google Lunar XPRIZE to become to the first private team to land a spacecraft on the moon. The companies are: Moon Express, SpaceIL, Synergy Moon and Team-Indus. c) Musk announces Mars plans: SpaceX founder Elon Musk said he will put a person on Mars by 2025. There are four key things we will need to get there: full reusability, refueling in orbit, propellant production on Mars, and a propellant that works. d) Breakthrough Starshot Project targets interstellar travel: Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner announced their collaborative venture \u201cBreakthrough Starshot\u201d \u2014 a $100 million attempt to make an interstellar starship.

Store shelves, as consumers have been warned, can be filled with everything from lead-contaminated jewelry and toys, to hormone-disrupting perfumes and lotions. Just in the last month, watchdog groups reported finding potentially toxic levels of phthalates in Spongebob Squarepants vinyl rain ponchos and flame retardants in Toys R Us furniture.  And let's not forget the neurotoxic lead and other chemicals that leach from some fake plastic Christmas trees. Despite growing recognition of toxic dangers that may lurk in consumer products, avoiding these chemicals is another story. Advocates continue to lament weak and outdated federal regulation of toxic chemicals, even though they cheer incremental gains, such as California's announcement last week that furniture manufacturers will no longer be required to fill their foam with flame retardants starting in January. The controversial chemicals are the subject of an award-winning Chicago Tribune series and a documentary, \"Toxic Hot Seat,\" which premiered Monday on HBO. (In light of this news, people with furniture on their holiday shopping lists may want to consider gifting an IOU.)   \"Right now, the dangers are invisible, unlabeled, and a consumer has no basis for making a reasonable and health-protected choice,\" said John Wargo, an environmental health expert at Yale University. \"The onus is on the consumer, who needs to do research product by product,\" he added. \"People don't have time for that and often opt for buying whatever is available.\" Some environmental groups are now attempting to make navigating around toxic chemicals easier for concerned shoppers, with a fleet of new consumer guides and mobile apps. A website launched in September, SafeMarkets.org, provides information, tips and resources, such as HealthyStuff.org's database of more than 5,000 tested consumer products. The new site from the Workgroup for Safe Markets, a collaboration of environmental groups, links to other sites, including a new nontoxic shopping guide published by Women's Voices for the Earth and Greenpeace's electronics buying guide.  An increasing number of tools are also available for shoppers on the go. Mobile product-rating apps from the Good Guide and the nonprofit Environmental Working Group allow users to simply scan a barcode. The latter, launched in mid-November, offers iPhone and Android versions of its Skin Deep database, which contains data on about 80,000 cosmetic and personal care products.  \"A lot of people are surprised when they start scanning,\" said Heather White, executive director of the Environmental Working Group. The average American uses 10 to 12 personal care products a day, totaling some 126 different ingredients.  Among the most critical ingredients to avoid due to their hormone-mimicking, cancer-causing, antibiotic-resistance-promoting or development-disturbing properties, according to White, are parabens, formaldehyde, triclosan, polyethylene, phthalates and \"fragrance.\" Fragrance formulas are protected as \"trade secrets,\" so their ingredients are rarely disclosed. White noted that the additives often include phthalates. Research published in November added an increased risk of preterm birth to the list of phthalates' potential health hazards.  \"Lip gloss, mascara, perfume. They are popular stocking stuffers,\" White added. \"But there are some serious concerns being raised each day.\" An app very similar to Environmental Working Group's is available for mobile phones called Think Dirty. Launched in October, its database includes close to 14,000 products -- primarily \"best sellers,\" according to founder and CEO Lily Tse. A comparison of the two apps by The Huffington Post showed significant differences between scores on the same products. Edge sensitive skin shave gel, for example, rated 4 out of 10 on Environmental Working Group's app, and 10 out of 10 on Tse's. Higher values mean greater toxicities, according to both scales. Tse suggested the discrepancy reflects differing philosophies on toxic chemical exposures.  \"For myself and many others with chemical sensitivity, it's important to stay away if a certain chemical is present, regardless of how much of it is there,\" said Tse. In this case, the presence of PEG-90M, triethanolamine and fragrance put the shave gel in the red.  Tse's advice for the holidays: Minimize fragrance use to protect yourself and others around you who may be chemically sensitive. \"You don't need to overload to show holiday spirit,\" she said. Perhaps no sight or smell represents the holiday spirit more than a Christmas tree. But the season staple isn't without chemical dangers, from pesticides at tree farms to lead and phthalates found in fake plastic versions and on the lights traditionally strung across branches. Yale's Wargo said he will likely be on the hunt for a Christmas tree this holiday weekend. \"I can't bring myself to buy a fake tree. We go to a tree farm every year,\" he said, choosing one that runs sustainably, without pesticides.  Still, Wargo's family falls short of avoiding chemical dangers. He recalled shopping for an extension cord the other day and seeing the ubiquitous warning label for lead. He said he uses old Christmas lights that are also likely contaminated. Mike Schade of the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment and Justice, who helped create the SafeMarkets.org website, emphasized the health hazards associated with PVC, also know as vinyl, used widely in fake Christmas trees, lights and in products wrapped and put under trees. He called PVC the \"poison plastic.\" \"From production to use, to disposal, it releases harmful chemicals that are building up in our bodies and are linked to chronic health problems on rise,\" Schade said, listing links to cancer, learning disabilities and obesity, among other conditions. He noted that heat from lights can encourage chemical additives to leach out. Phthalates and lead are among chemicals that have been commonly added to PVC to soften and stabilize the plastic. While some companies have eliminated those chemicals, scientists are finding that organotins and other replacement additives may be toxic, too. \"We don't want to be a grinch,\" Schade said. \"We just recommend consumers avoid purchasing trees, toys or infant products made of PVC, even if they are labeled lead or phthalate-free.\" A potential red flag are items imported from China, added Schade. Several such products have been found in recent years to be contaminated with lead or elevated phthalates.  \"But just because it's made in the U.S., doesn't mean it's necessarily safe,\" Schade said. \"Our chemical safety system is broken.\" Even the patches in place to help protect consumers, advocates warned, are far from foolproof. While laws restrict certain chemicals from products aimed at younger children, for example, Penelope Jagessar Chaffer warned that parents also need to be cautious about what they bring into the home for older members of their family. Play jewelry gifted to a teen girl, for example, may find its way into the hands and mouth of a more vulnerable little sister or brother. Jagessar Chaffer is the director of the film \"Toxic Baby,\" which will be released next year as an innovative iPad app with additional footage, an interactive map of toxic sites across the country and an encyclopedia of information on toxic chemicals. One of the awards for pledging to her soon-to-launch Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign will be a toxic audit -- available for Christmas or New Year's.  \"People do tend to buy a lot from Black Friday onward,\" said Jagessar Chaffer. \"I can help them navigate what presents to get, what they bring into their home.\" She added that if people plan to purchase big-ticket items during after-Christmas sales, she can also help them manage toxicity levels or even decide if now is the time to buy an air filter or HEPA vacuum.  It's this rise and dispersal of information that experts and advocates said they believe is the key to solving our toxic chemical woes. Wargo likened it to the evolution of organic food. That was caused, he said, by \"widescale recognition among consumers that pesticides are potentially dangerous.\" \"As more people are educated, our hope is that they'll take action to move the market,\" said Environmental Working Group's White. \"As the market changes, we hope the political climate changes -- giving more hope for revising our outdated law.\"  \"We can't shop our way out of this problem,\" White added.'}.

The Spurs\u2019 young star hit 7 of 10 shots from 3-point range, made one-legged, fade-away jumpers and put his team on his back while scoring eight of their 12 points in overtime. It still wasn\u2019t enough. In the end, it was Marc Gasol\u2019s floating jumper over LaMarcus Aldridge with 0.7 seconds left in overtime that gave the Memphis Grizzlies a 110-108 victory over the Spurs on Saturday night at FedExForum to even their first-round Western Conference playoff series at 2-2. \u201c(Gasol) made the play that mattered,\u201d said Mike Conley, who led Memphis with a postseason franchise record 35 points and had nine rebounds and eight assists. \u201cIt\u2019s scary as hell watching (Leonard). He was unbelievable.\u201d Kawhi Leonard is the first player ever in @NBA history to have 40+ points, 5+ three-pointers and 5+ steals in a playoff game. pic.twitter.com/0WasggO464 Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said the same of the game. \u201cBoth teams played their hearts out,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a fantastic basketball game. The fans got their money\u2019s worth. Marc made a great shot. L.A. (Aldridge) contested it very well; it (went) down.\u201d But one key shot right at the rim did not go down. With 1:36 left in overtime and the Spurs up 102-100, Spurs guard Tony Parker stole a pass from Conley and had a fastbreak with Patty Mills. But as Mills went in for what looked like a sure layup and a four-point lead, Grizzlies rookie guard Andrew Harrison blocked him from behind. That started a fastbreak the other way that ended with a Gasol layup, a foul by David Lee, and a Gasol free throw for a 103-102 Memphis lead. \u201cThat was the play of the game, other than Marc\u2019s,\u201d Conley said. \u201cFor a young guy to make a play like that, that\u2019s a five-point swing. We gave it up for him in the locker room, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Said Harrison, who also had seven points and three rebounds: \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to give up on the play. I thought I had a chance to hit the ball and I did.\u201d Leonard added eight rebounds, six steals and three assists to his stat line and his fade-away jumper with 12 seconds left in regulation gave San Antonio a 96-94 lead. But Conley, who had 11 points in the fourth, answered with a floater in the lane with 4.5 seconds left to tie the game at 96. Leonard then missed a contested 21-footer at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. It was a rare miss in the fourth quarter and overtime, where Leonard was 8-for-13 from the floor and 5-for-6 from distance. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m taking suggestions on how to guard Kawhi Leonard,\u201d Memphis coach David Fizdale said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything and the guy is just tough. Man, is he a superstar.\u201d The Grizzlies overcame 23 turnovers that translated into 31 San Antonio points. \u201cYou just got to keep playing,\u201d said Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds. \u201cYou got to go on to the next play, and the next play after that.\u201d Gasol finished with 16 points, 12 rebounds and four assists; he also committed seven turnovers. JaMychal Green had 14 points off the bench. Parker had 22 points and five assists for San Antonio. Aldridge scored 13 points. The Spurs shot 42.3 percent from the floor and went 9-for-30 from 3-point range (30 percent). Memphis shot 46.3 percent from the field while going 12-for-27 from distance (44.4 percent). The Spurs had a 10-point lead in the first quarter and an opportunity to take away the Grizzlies\u2019 hope. But passing that first test set Memphis up for all the others that would follow. \u201cI learned a long time ago if you don\u2019t have mental stability when they punch you in the mouth, you\u2019re in the wrong business,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cI thought we played well enough to win the game,\u201d Parker said, and then looking ahead to Game 5 in San Antonio: \u201cIt\u2019s a must-win situation for us now.\u201d Conley says the Grizzlies view Game 5 the same way. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re in desperation mode,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the media, we were supposed to be swept anyway.\u201d NOTES: The Grizzlies\u2019 Game 3 victory on Thursday night snapped the Spurs\u2019 10-game postseason winning streak over Memphis. The Grizzlies had not defeated the Spurs since Game 6 of their first-round series in 2011 when Memphis became just the second No. 8 seed in NBA history to eliminate a No. 1 seed. ... Spurs C Dewayne Dedmon missed Game 4 with an illness. David Lee started in his place. ... Memphis SG Vince Carter (13 points) became the first 40-year-old to make at least three triples in a playoff game, going 3-for-5 from long range.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Pruitt, already the target of multiple investigations for lavish spending and possible ethics violations, relied on the same lobbyist who helped plan a controversial trip to Morocco in December to arrange details of travel to Australia earlier last year,\u00a0CNN reported on Thursday.\u00a0Additionally, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and GOP backer, played a major role in helping shape Pruitt\u2019s planned trip to Israel in February,\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post reported. It\u2019s very unusual for a person outside government to arrange travel plans for a Cabinet official, ethics experts have noted, and some critics have questioned whether Pruitt violated federal law by recruiting lobbyists and friends for this role. Public officials are\u00a0prohibited\u00a0from using their position to financially benefit friends.\u00a0 The Post reported that Pruitt had been enlisting \u201cwell-connected friends and political allies\u201d to help plan overseas travel since he took office. \u201cPruitt drew up a list of at least a dozen countries he hoped to visit and urged aides to help him find official reasons to travel,\u201d the paper added. Reports earlier this week revealed that Pruitt relied heavily on a longtime friend and former Comcast lobbyist, Richard Smotkin, to help plan his expensive trip to Morocco. Smotkin reportedly was hired as a lobbyist by the Moroccan government shortly after Pruitt\u2019s visit,\u00a0raising questions about whether the embattled EPA chief\u2019s trip served to benefit Smotkin financially. Smotkin also was involved in Pruitt planned trip to Australia last year, according to CNN.\u00a0The lobbyist played a \u201ccritical\u201d role in connecting the EPA head to Matthew Freedman, treasurer of the business lobby group the American Australian Council, and intended to travel to Australia with Pruitt, according to the report. Freedman reportedly also was involved in planning the Australia trip and conferred with Pruitt\u2019s staff to arrange the EPA chief\u2019s schedule and talking points. Freedman suggested to Pruitt\u2019s aides that the Institute of Public Affairs, a climate skeptic think tank, serve as co-host of Pruitt\u2019s visit, reported The Guardian this week, citing emails recently released to the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act. The Australia visit, which had been slated to take place around September 2017, was eventually canceled. The EPA said at the time that Hurricane Harvey had derailed Pruitt\u2019s travel schedule. The planned trip to Israel in February was canceled days before the EPA head was scheduled to leave, after news broke that Pruitt\u2019s first-class travel had cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars.\u00a0 An Adelson associate reportedly met with two Pruitt aides to discuss the Israel itinerary in the days leading up to Pruitt\u2019s departure.\u00a0Adelson was said to have helped connect Pruitt with Water-Gen, an Israeli water purification company that makes products the EPA recently agreed to test.\u00a0 On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers wrote to the EPA administrator calling for more details about \u201cthe role Mr. Adelson or other non-governmental officials played\u201d in the agreement with Water-Gen and the planned trip to Israel.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Trump's Labor Law Enforcer Freezes Worker-Friendly Reforms Made Under Obama', body='During the Barack Obama years, the National Labor Relations Board took a broad view of worker rights, expanding protections for employees who try to join a union or come together to improve their working conditions. Under the Trump administration, those rights are being reined in to help out employers. In a memo dated Friday and obtained by HuffPost, the NLRB\u2019s new general counsel, Peter B. Robb, orders board officials around the country to consult his office on cases that involve precedents set on worker rights during the last eight years. The move effectively strips away the discretion of regional board officers to pursue cases against employers based upon Obama-era rulings and policies. Put simply, the rights that were expanded under Obama are pretty much on hold.  The NLRB is the independent federal agency responsible for refereeing disputes between employers, workers and their unions. The general counsel plays a critical role at the board and functions as a quasi-prosecutor, deciding which major cases to investigate and pursue when workers claim their rights have been violated. Robb was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate on Nov. 8.  Wilma Liebman, a former Democratic chairwoman of the five-member board that rules on those cases, said it is standard for a new general counsel to issue a memo ordering certain cases to be sent to Washington for advice, particularly those involving recent precedents.\u00a0Robb\u2019s Democratic predecessor issued a similar memo when he came onboard.\u00a0Still, Liebman said, she was surprised by the \u201csweeping\u201d breadth of Robb\u2019s memo and the speed with which it was issued after his confirmation. \u201cThe direction is crystal clear,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cThere is an agenda: Fewer workers will have fewer rights.\u201d Many of the precedents Robb cites in his memo involve what\u2019s known as Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. Those rights are at the heart of collective bargaining law, guaranteeing workers the ability to band together and engage in \u201cmutual aid and protection.\u201d Through their rulings and legal guidance, the board nominees under Obama took a relatively expansive view of what\u2019s considered legally protected activity by workers. \u00a0\u00a0 Robb\u2019s outlook is much more likely to please employers. In his memo, he said he would be rescinding seven \u201cguidance memos\u201d that were crafted by his Democratic predecessors. These are memos that advise board officials on how to interpret and enforce the law. He also said it was mandatory for board officials to seek his office\u2019s advice on matters involving \u201ccases over the last eight years that overruled precedent and involved one or more dissents\u201d by board members. Some of the precedents cited in his memo infuriated business groups, like the case known as Browning-Ferris. That board ruling made it easier for a big corporation to be deemed a \u201cjoint employer\u201d alongside their subcontractors or franchisees. The change has helped workers and unions bring cases against a company like McDonald\u2019s and not just against the individual franchisees who operate McDonald\u2019s restaurants. Other cases were lesser known but could affect workers around the country who end up in disputes with their employers. One Obama-era case clarified employees\u2019 ability to use their work emails to try to organize a union or talk about working conditions. Another case outlined employees\u2019 ability to record company meetings, including anti-union speeches made by bosses. It\u2019s common for the labor board to become more friendly to employers than workers after a Republican wins the White House. Until his nomination, Robb was a management-side attorney who represented employers and trade groups. He served as an attorney at the labor board during the early 1980s.\u00a0 Read the memo: Are you aware of major changes at the NLRB or the Labor Department? Send us tips.'}.

That\u2019s because science is the foundation of democracy. The ideas of science were critical to America\u2019s founders\u2019 battles to beat back the authoritarianism of King George. Benjamin Franklin was a scientist. Thomas Jefferson was a scientist and lawyer. Benjamin Rush was a scientist and physician. George Washington stressed the importance of science in the first State of the Union address. This is because for freedom to survive, it has to be based on the idea that there is such a thing as objective reality that we can all turn to to settle arguments of fact. And what creates that objective reality? Evidence from science. Without it, we are left with arguments being won by the person with the biggest stick, the fattest wallet, the most violent mob, or the most ardent religious followers. Given how these authoritarian alternatives played out over the centuries, the idea of a democracy based on science seemed pretty good to our nation\u2019s founders, and it should to us too. In 1776, when Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, he turned to his three idols\u2014the scientists Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, and John Locke. He synthesized their thinking into a simple but compelling argument: that if anyone could discover the truth of something for him or herself using the tools of reason and science, then all men are created equal, and no king, no pope, and no wealthy lord had any more right to govern than the people themselves. It was self-evident. In turn, attacks on science weaken the foundation of the notion of a shared objective reality on which democracy depends to function. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in politics today. As attacks by ideologues and industry have been broadcast by a news media trained that there is no such thing as objectivity, we have become paralyzed, and our government is at risk of failing. Massive anti-science public relations campaigns whose sole purpose is to forestall or reverse evidence-based legislation their funders don\u2019t like have the side effect of undermining the public requirement that politicians stick to the facts. The public relations strategy has seven distinct steps to create \u201cuncertainties\u201d and manipulate the media. They are used in every industry where this happens: tobacco, fossil fuels, pesticides, sugar, mining, and others. It goes like this: Fund and create fake science that uses cherry-picking, p-hacking, and other statistical tricks to create a counter narrative that can form a basis for creating public uncertainties about the real science, then publish it in fake journals, which is easy to do online. Direct slanted press materials to bloggers whose websites pay them per click and encourage them to attack the integrity, conclusions and motives of the respected scientists in the field; use the attacks and blog posts to drive the manufactured controversy into the mainstream press. Fund and create industry-aligned front-groups to \u201cwhip up grassroots anger and frustration\u201d about the \u201ccontroversy\u201d and the limits to freedom the real scientists\u2019 findings will supposedly cause; then hold demonstrations and publicity events. Hire contrarian scientists to proselytize about the \u201cuncertainties\u201d of the legitimate science to professionals and influencers in the local communities of the member of Congress you are trying to influence, and to appear in committee hearings on the topic. Once in the press, push the story by placing opinion pieces in papers and booking advocates on television shows to discuss the \u201ccontroversy.\u201d Work with sympathetic legislators to craft bills that address the \u201cproblem,\u201d limiting or rolling back regulations and legislation based on the evidence because of the appearance of a controversy, and arguing that any action is premature. At this point representatives of the \u201cinnocent\u201d corporations that have been funding the attacks can safely step out from behind the curtain and testify on the bill, showing how its adoption would cost American jobs and reduce freedom. The method has been used so successfully for so long that science has come to be viewed by many political leaders as just another special interest or ideological view, which can be regarded as partisan and dismissed. We hear cries of how liberal scientists with a socialist agenda want to control your life and limit your freedom. \u201cWhy should we fund science at all?\u201d is the logical conclusion of such a train of thought, and so we are now seeing drastic, historic cuts proposed. Two things bear remembering: Science is never partisan. It\u2019s very method is designed to cull what we know away from our many biases. But science is always political. Science creates knowledge; knowledge is power, and that power either confirms or challenges somebody\u2019s vested interests, which is always a political act. And there\u2019s the rub. But the dangers of denial are immense. In Germany in 1920, deniers of the theory of relativity mounted ad hominem attacks against Albert Einstein, branding general relativity as a \u201choax,\u201d and denouncing its Jewish nature. \u201cThis world is a strange madhouse,\u201d Einstein wrote a friend at the time. \u201cCurrently every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct. Belief in this matter depends on political party affiliation.\u201d Something similar happened in China during the Cultural Revolution. It happened in the Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Renaissance Italy, 20th Century Russia, and Nazi Germany\u2014all of them societies whose leaders denied science and evidence in favor of authoritarian ideology, and the societies collapsed. Everything you take for granted about life is at risk when those in power are allowed to deny evidence or muzzle truth tellers.

And sometimes it isn\u2019t. If you are a woman, person of color, older or disabled, chances are high that if you fought the law, the law won. The bombshell release last week of allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein for decades of sexual harassment and discrimination against women resulted in his being fired from his position as co-chair of the Weinstein Company. The fallout was decisive. \u201cIt is essential to our Company\u2019s culture that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination,\u201d the board reported, according to Buzzfeed. But such swift and definitive action is not the norm. The silence around a legacy of incidents like those surrounding Hurricane Harvey Weinstein is perpetuated in most all industries. The authors of the new book, Rights on Trial: How Workplace Discrimination Perpetuates Inequality, examined nearly 2,000 cases filed between 1988 and 2003 across the U.S.. The three authors interviewed more than 100 plaintiffs, defendants, lawyers and involved parties to find that the workplace often is not fair in cases of discrimination. The success rate for cases of discrimination filed is dismal; only two percent of plaintiffs win at trial. That is after 19 percent of the cases were dismissed. Half or 50 percent have early settlements, 18 percent of the cases are lost on summary judgment and 8 percent of the cases have a late settlement. But each one of those cases is a story. And in each one of of those cases, voice is a metaphor for civil justice. \u201cVoice is important in legal disputes,\u201d says Laura Beth Nielsen, a co-author of the book, that literally gives voice to those involved with audio clips of the interviews on its site. In these \u201cworkplace wars,\u201d the stories are heartbreaking,\u201d says Nielsen, research professor at the American Bar Foundation, and Professor of Sociology and Director of Legal Studies at Northwestern University. Consider the case of Kristen Baker, whose case is highlighted in the book. Baker was a 33-year-old assistant buyer in the sales division of a small, family-owned manufacturing company. A salesman \u201cbegan bringing pornographic magazines and movies to work\u201d and also charging for admission to viewing parties of those movies in the conference room at lunch time. He showed her pictures of bestiality. She filed multiple complaints to human resources, then the final straw was the salesman\u2019s physical act of sexual harassment. So Baker filed a discrimination case. Her employer offered her $10,000 to leave the company. Baker eventually settled for $1, a public apology and the option to keep her job. Authors Nielsen, Robert L. Nelson and Ellen Berrey write in the book: It may be difficult to believe that discrimination this blatant and offensive still occurs in American workplaces every day, but it does. In her new book, Reset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change, Ellen Pao, who lost her $16 million gender discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 2015, said it was worth it to tell her story that \u201cstarted a conversation about systemic bias in Silicon Valley, giving others the courage to report their own experiences,\u201d according to Recode. \u201cThe sad thing is we tend to reject people who make rights claims,\u201d says Nelson, a co-author and  Director Emeritus of the American Bar Foundation, the MacCrate Research Chair in the Legal Profession at the ABF, and professor of sociology and law at Northwestern. \u201cWe have a process where prominent stereotypes about persons of color, women, the aged and disabled\u201d come into play, Nelson says. A  gender discrimination suit was filed recently against Winston & Strawn, adding to gender discrimination suits by former attorneys against legacy law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP, Chadbourne & Parke, Proskauer Rose, LeClairRyan and Sedgwick, according to Above The Law.   In the most recent case brought by Constance Ramos, \u201cas reported by Law.com, the complaint alleges Ramos was never treated as a lawyer and partner in her own right, but as \u2018an appendage of a male superior\u2019 that the firm sought to be rid of when the equity partners that Ramos joined the firm with, ultimately left Winston.\u201d Ramos\u2019 experience of being excluded from meetings is similar to the experiences of Pao, who told PBS News Hour: Such high profile lawsuits are extremely rare. Fewer than one percent of employees who perceive they were discriminated against, file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And only 15 percent of EEOC charges lead to a lawsuit filed, and only 6 percent of those cases make it to trial. \u201cWe see a symbolic valorization of rights in the abstract,\u201d says co-author Ellen Berrey, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto and an affiliated scholar of the American Bar Foundation. But in real, concrete terms, there is \u201cstructural inequality,\u201d Berrey says, recalling that one defense attorney claimed he \u201cnever saw a valid case.\u201d While this book covers U.S. cases, workplace discrimination is an international problem. \u201cAccording to a 2017 report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), there is no universally accepted definition of \u2018harassment\u2019 or \u2018violence\u2019 with regard to the world of work,\u201d according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Gayle Tzemach Lemmon writes: In this country, to improve the system and to change policy with \u201cthe levers of power,\u201d according to Nelson, the authors offer several suggestions. These strategies include providing more access to legal representation; more EEOC resources and state fair employment agencies; better forms of communication with the EEOC and charging parties; access to employee information for employees on demographics and compensation; and addressing racial disparities in legal representation. Employees telling their stories of discrimination and reporting are initial steps.  The more voices, the louder the call for equity. Pao told PBS News Hour: As Jennifer Siebel Newsom, founder and CEO of The Representation Project, filmmaker of \u201cMiss Representation\u201d and \u201cThe Mask You Live In,\u201d writes on HuffPost: This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

The Charleston Gazette's Ken Ward Jr. reports that Freedom Industries, the company that owns the leaking tanks, told state officials nearly a year ago that it was keeping thousands of pounds of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol in the company's storage facility about a mile and a half up the Elk River from where West Virginia American Water draws supplies for thousands in the Charleston area. The chemical is used to wash coal after it is mined from the ground. The disclosure was included in paperwork that Freedom Industries had filed under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, a 1986 law that is meant ensure that the public and first responders are adequately informed in the case of an accident, and that there is a plan to deal with it, such as alerts and evacuations. The paper reports that state emergency response officials had a copy of the form, and so did the emergency planners and responders in Kanawha County. But the officials and first responders appeared to be caught entirely off guard by the accident, the paper reports: Those same agencies and public officials, though, have said they know little about the chemical involved. They're all acting a bit surprised that this mystery substance was being stockpiled so close to a crucial water intake, and shocked that something like this could have happened. Water company officials are equally puzzled. For example, West Virginia American Water President Jeff McIntyre told reporters on Friday that his company didn't know much about the chemical's possible dangers, wasn't aware of an effective treatment process, and wasn't even sure exactly how much 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol is too much.\n Despite the storage facility's proximity to the water supply, it does not appear that the company, state or local officials had any emergency response plan in place. The article also notes that federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials have never inspected the Freedom Industries site, and the state Department of Environmental Protection had not inspected it in more than 20 years.

A 56-percent majority say it\u2019s possible to pass new gun laws without violating the Second Amendment, down from a high of 65 percent. And, regardless of how they personally feel about the subject, just 40 percent now think passing new gun laws is politically possible, down from 50 percent. Concern about gun violence and a desire for Congress to take action are now several percentage points higher than they were in April, when most of the post-Parkland wave had already abated,\u00a0but it\u2019s difficult to say how much of that represents a genuine uptick, rather than the variability\u00a0inherent in tracking polls.\u00a0Either way, it\u2019s clear that the energy around crafting new gun policies isn\u2019t near the heights reached earlier this year. Similarly, tracking data from the progressive pollster Civiqs showed voters\u2019 support for gun control spiking after Parkland, but then slowly declining. Santa Fe, it found, at most seemed to modestly stanch that decline. Google Trends, which tracks how often people query the search engine on varying topics,\u00a0shows that comparatively little attention has been paid to gun issues following the lastest school shooting.\u00a0 The difference in public opinion following the two school shootings isn\u2019t entirely surprising: It mirrors the difference in how each community responded.\u00a0Although Americans were shocked by the Parkland massacre, the shift in public opinion it produced didn\u2019t gain steam until the weeks that followed, when the surviving students spearheaded a gun control push. Their advocacy kept the debate over gun laws in the news, even after the immediate details of the shooting had faded. Although student activists nationwide led walkouts earlier this year in protest of gun violence, polling of teens finds that such attitudes aren\u2019t universal among their generation.\u00a0In largely rural Santa Fe,\u00a0last week\u2019s shooting didn\u2019t spark the same kind of push for gun control. There were no local protests, and little talk of guns,the Los Angeles Times reported. \u201cI don\u2019t think guns are the problem \u2014 I think people are the problem,\u201d a 16-year-old Santa Fe high school student\u00a0told NBC. \u201cEven if we did more gun laws, people who are sick enough to do something like this are still going to figure out a way to do it. So it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Gun restrictions proposed in the wake of the Parkland shooting, meanwhile, remain broadly popular, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Americans, 78 percent to 11 percent, say that they favor strengthening background checks for buying and selling guns. They also say, 64 percent to 22 percent, that they favor raising the age for gun purchases to 21.\u00a0 A plurality, 43 percent, say President Donald Trump is not doing enough to pass gun laws, while just 6 percent believe he\u2019s done too much.

Since 2012, Republicans have consistently won the same 12 of Ohio\u2019s 16 congressional seats, while winning between 51 and 59 percent of the state\u2019s popular vote. The suit alleges that Republicans maintain this remarkable advantage because they controlled the redistricting process in 2011 and worked in secret to draw a map to guarantee just that outcome each year. The suit was filed Wednesday in federal court on behalf of 16 voters in each of the state\u2019s congressional districts, the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a labor and civil rights group. The lawsuit underscores a growing confidence among voting rights groups over the last few years in bringing challenges to congressional plans that Republicans have benefited from since 2012. The Supreme Court has never said whether an electoral map can be so partisan that it violates the Constitution, but\u00a0it is expected\u00a0to rule in two cases that make that argument\u00a0in June.\u00a0A ruling setting constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering could profoundly affect American politics by requiring lawmakers to draw districts that are more competitive. Two more congressional elections are due to take place under Ohio\u2019s current map before the next round of redistricting in 2021. Even though litigation can move very slowly, the ACLU hopes to have a new map in place for the 2020 congressional elections. Alora Thomas, an attorney with the ACLU, said her organization felt encouraged to bring the suit after multiple rulings in lower courts blocking electoral maps in Wisconsin and North Carolina on partisan grounds. (Those rulings are currently paused while the Supreme Court considers appeals.) In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s congressional maps as too partisan for the state Constitution. A challenge to Michigan\u2019s congressional map on partisan grounds is also before a federal court. \u201cBecause courts are really now open to taking a look at this issue, and it looks like they\u2019re going the right way and finding partisan gerrymandering unconstitutional, the question becomes, \u2018Well, where else is there a problem and is it something that needs to be addressed now?\u2019\u201d Thomas told HuffPost. \u201cOhio is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.\u201d An analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found that Ohio\u2019s congressional map has some of the most severe partisan bias in the country and accounts for between two and three additional GOP seats in the current Congress. Thomas said the ACLU didn\u2019t want to wait until Ohio got a new congressional map in 2022, because Ohio residents have already spent nearly a decade voting under a map the group believes is unconstitutional. A fairer map in place before the next round of redistricting, Thomas said, could ensure that the map for the subsequent decade is also fairer. Ohio voters also recently approved a ballot initiative to change the way redistricting is done in the state, a move that advocates hope will rein in excessive partisan gerrymandering. The suit argues that the Ohio map violates the First and 14th Amendments,\u00a0as well as Article I of the Constitution. The map violates the First Amendment, the suit says, because it amounts to an effort to \u201cskew electoral outcomes to freeze their advantage and insulate their majority from changes in voter preferences.\u201d It violates the 14th Amendment, the ACLU says, because lawmakers drew the map intentionally to disfavor Democratic voters in the state without a legitimate reason to do so. The ACLU also argues that in drawing such a severely gerrymandered map, Ohio lawmakers exceeded the power the Constitution gives them to regulate elections. The case will hinge significantly on what the Supreme Court decides by the end of June. During oral argument in two partisan gerrymandering cases this year, the court seemed willing to allow some amount of politics in redistricting, but appeared closely divided on whether it was possible to determine if partisan gerrymandering could go so far that it violates the Constitution. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote in a 2004 case that such a standard might exist, is seen as the critical swing vote in the case, and advocates have offered a number of standards with the hope that he might find one he likes. Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who signed the state\u2019s congressional map into law in 2011, is named as a defendant in the suit. But Kasich has recently been an outspoken opponent of partisan gerrymandering, and was one of a number of Republican elected officials who urged the Supreme Court in October to step in and do something about gerrymandering.

Wells is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of last year \u201cuntil it sufficiently improves its governance and controls,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. Wells Fargo estimated that the cap will cut its annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year, as it reduces some parts of its balance sheet, like corporate deposits and trading assets, in order to continue growing core businesses. That represents 1.5 to 1.9 percent of the profit Wells generated in 2017. The bank will also replace three board members by April and a fourth board member by the end of the year, the Fed said, without naming who they should be. Wells Fargo shares fell 6.1 percent to $60.10 in after-hours trading. The Fed\u2019s consent order will have a \u201cmanageable\u201d impact on profits and should not affect the bank\u2019s plans to return capital to shareholders this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said during a conference call with analysts on Friday evening. \u201cWe are in a very competitive business whether we have a consent order or not,\u201d said Sloan. \u201cOur marching orders to our team are, go out and serve your customers, fulfill our vision, take deposits, make loans. We are open for business.\u201d While Sloan said he takes the matter seriously, he also characterized it as the latest step in a risk-management and corporate governance overhaul that Wells Fargo began some time ago, when it realized it had a serious problem with sales practices. The bank reached a $190 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Los Angeles prosecutor in September 2016 over employees opening phony accounts in customers\u2019 names without their permission to artificially hit internal targets. The tally of fake accounts has since risen to as many as 3.5 million. Regulators have rarely intervened directly in a bank\u2019s operations in the past, and it is unprecedented for the Fed to order a bank to stop growing altogether, officials said. But Wells Fargo\u2019s aggressive business strategy prioritized growth over effective risk management, leading to serious compliance breakdowns, the central bank said. Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet expanded steadily from the end of 2013 to 2016, but growth slowed dramatically last year as it battled to address the issues raised by the scandal. The bank must submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days detailing how it has enhanced oversight from its board of directors and improved compliance and risk management functions, and how it plans to improve further. Once the Fed approves those plans, Wells will hire third-party consultants to review them and monitor its progress until the regulator is satisfied. The San Francisco Fed and top regulatory officials in Washington will lead the review, the central bank said. \u201cWe cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank,\u201d said Chair Janet Yellen in a statement on her final day as leader of the central bank. Since the 2016 settlement, Wells has taken steps to enhance oversight at the board level, centralize risk-management functions and install new executives to oversee key businesses and control functions. Its board chair, Betsy Duke, is a former Fed governor, and it recently hired Sarah Dahlgren, a former New York Fed official, as its head of regulatory relations.

But consider the lies that truth exposes. If corporations are making record profits \u2013 they are \u2013 then exactly why should the US adopt a gigantic corporate tax cut? There is only one page of details available from the administration about its tax plan, but we know it aims to confer trillions on corporations and the super-rich. That\u2019s why the Koch Brothers are promising dozens of events and rallies around the country, and the corporate-friendly American Action Network says it\u2019s ready to spend $20 million to support tax cuts for the wealthy. But what\u2019s the rationale? If corporations are already doing great, why exactly do they need trillions of dollars in tax breaks? If corporations are making record profits \u2013 they are \u2013 then how is it that regulations are strangling corporate activity? Donald Trump and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce endlessly recite thoroughly discredited claims that excessive regulation is strangling corporations. In fact, health, safety and environmental regulations spur innovation and help the economy. And it was regulatory failure that enabled the housing bubble and Great Recession, which together did far more harm to the economy (and even corporate profits) than regulations ever could. If corporations are making record profits \u2013 they are \u2013 then why are wages stagnant? Well, actually those two things go together. Corporations are grabbing a larger share of national income \u2013 taking it directly from working people. And the wage income that is being parceled is going increasingly to the top 1 percent. From 1979 to 2013, wages of the top 1 percent grew 138 percent. For the bottom 90 percent of the population, wages rose only 15 percent. If corporations are making record profits, shouldn\u2019t workers reasonably expect that more of the gains be shared with them? If corporations are making record profits \u2013 they are \u2013 then why we can\u2019t raise the minimum wage? In 1968, the minimum wage was $11.25/hour in today\u2019s dollars \u2015 $4 an hour more than the current minimum wage. That understates how far behind the minimum wage is \u2013 the overall economy has grown almost four times during that period. If corporations are making record profits \u2013 they are \u2013 then why is there so little money in the Trump budget for low-income home heating or Medicaid or food stamps or food safety or consumer safety or public housing or legal services or disease research or mass transit or global health or international disaster relief or environmental protection or scientific research or agricultural research or energy efficiency? Why is the government supposedly so poor and cash strapped that it can\u2019t do the things we need to do to take care of each other, maintain a decent society, avert preventable illness and disease, invest in our infrastructure, promote innovation or avert catastrophic climate change, the greatest threat humanity has every faced? One inconvenient truth that Donald Trump did not elucidate is that record corporate profitability has virtually nothing to do with his six months in office. Many commentators are highlighting this point, saying that \u201ccredit\u201d should really go to the Obama administration. That\u2019s a reasonable argument, as far as it goes. But it also points to deep structural problems in our economy, our politics and society. For while the Obama administration did not propose, ridiculously, to slash corporate taxes nor wage a savage attack on regulatory protections nor aim to hack away at vital government programs, it did preside over a period of record corporate profits amidst ongoing wage stagnation. Surviving the Trump administration will enable us to put many problems behind us, but not the most pernicious. Robert Weissman is the president of Public Citizen.'}.

In 2012, Brandon Hall forged signatures to get a judicial candidate on the ballot in Ottawa County, Michigan. He was convicted of 10 counts of election fraud and sentenced in 2016 to 30 days in jail and 18 months probation. He is still serving\u00a0the probation portion of his sentence. Hall was a volunteer on Trump\u2019s campaign in Michigan and had VIP access to his rally in the state on April 28, according to photos he posted\u00a0on his Facebook page. The photos showcase Hall\u2019s front-row seat to Trump\u2019s rally in Washington, Michigan. One of the pictures shows him standing at the same lectern where Trump spoke. Hall\u2019s level of access is notable given the Trump administration\u2019s focus on voter fraud, which several analyses have shown is not a widespread problem. Trump claims that between three and five million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, but has offered no evidence to support that claim. In April, he dismissed the idea that voter fraud was a conspiracy theory, saying \u201cin many places, like California, the same person votes many times, you probably heard about that.\u201d Trump convened a panel to investigate voter fraud last year but disbanded it in January as it struggled to assemble voting data from all 50 states and faced a slew of lawsuits. Hall declined to comment on his attendance at the rally. \u201cThe fake news media should spend their time covering stories that matter to real Americans instead of pandering to DC elites, like President Trump\u2019s historic peace talks with North Korea, which caused South Korean President Kim Jae-in to say President Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cEmployment levels for Hispanic and Black Americans are higher than they have been in decades, same for women. \u00a0I could go on and on, but of course, you won\u2019t publish it.\u201d In a follow-up email, he corrected the South Korean leader\u2019s name to Moon Jae-in.

Women held 31 percent of all tech jobs back then, a percentage that was steadily rising, according to a new report from the United States\u00a0Census Bureau. Then the industry boomed. The number of jobs in information technology increased tenfold to 4.6 million between 1970 and 2014. Thanks to the internet, the number of different types of jobs exploded. Pay grew, too. And something funny happened. The percentage of women in tech declined. By 2014, just a quarter of these workers were women. That\u2019s despite the fact that increasing numbers of women were joining the U.S. workforce. What\u2019s up? A lot has been written already about a long-standing bias against women in tech that starts when girls are young and never really stops. But, to paraphrase the Republican candidate for president: Something else is going on.\u00a0When a career becomes more prestigious, women don\u2019t fare very well. Claire Cain Miller wrote about this in The New York Times earlier this year. But she focused on the opposite end: When women enter male-dominated fields, she reported, pay in that field declines.\u00a0When more women started working in recreation (parks or camps) between 1950 and 2000, hourly wages fell 57 percent, according to a study she cites in the article.\u00a0 When a job becomes dominated by women, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s as important to the bottom line or requires as much skill, \u201d Paula England, a sociology professor at New York University, told the Times. \u201cGender bias sneaks into those decisions.\u201d The reverse also holds, as the story noted at the time. When men enter female-dominated fields, pay in that field rises. In the case of IT workers, women never were a majority, yet as the number of jobs grew and the prestige of the industry increased, more men came on board and essentially took over. The percentage of women in IT fell. So, to sum up: When women enter a field, its perceived value suffers a decline; when men enter a field, it grows in prestige.  Gradually, the image of the ideal tech worker has become that of a white guy in a hoodie working nonstop at a computer. Women have become increasingly alienated from that scenario.

Just two weeks ago, the government dropped its effort to require Apple to crack an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December attacks in San Bernardino, California, saying it had unlocked the phone without Apple's help. Some observers thought the government would back away from the New York case too, since the suspect has already pleaded guilty. But in a letter filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the Justice Department said, \"The government continues to require Apple's assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant.\" An Apple attorney said Friday the company was disappointed but not surprised that the government would continue to fight in New York after giving up in California. He said the appeal belied the FBI's claim that the San Bernardino case was about a single phone and the need to stop future terror acts. Apple, with the strong support of most of the technology industry, argues that requiring it to circumvent the encryption in its own products would inevitability open the door for hackers and foreign spies and undermine security for everyone. The company has said it is willing to take the issue to the Supreme Court. The phones in the two cases have different security features, with the New York phone running an earlier version of the iPhone operating software. The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, who is leading the battle against Apple, said Thursday that the method used on the San Bernardino phone would not work on other models. But the New York phone is much easier for Apple to break into. Apple has acknowledged it could get data from the drug dealer's phone without crafting special software, as it would have had to do with the San Bernardino phone. Apple helped law enforcement with earlier iPhones on some 70 occasions, according to court documents, and it objected to the order in the New York case only after it was invited to do so last fall by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein. Since then, Apple has declined to comply with such orders without a fight, a person close to the company said. In a case that came to light Friday, a Boston judge had ordered Apple to cooperate in a gang case. Apple also objected there, and the Justice Department said it has not yet decided whether to push again to force its assistance. In a ruling issued on Feb. 29, Orenstein came down firmly on Apple's side, rejecting the idea that an old law known as the All Writs Act gave judges the power to order Apple's help. That judge, Apple and the FBI have all said the balance between encryption and law enforcement access should be struck by Congress, and one such proposal is nearing formal introduction by the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee. The Justice Department announcement Friday, however, showed it will continue to fight in the courts as well. Jill Bronfman, director of the Privacy and Technology Project at University of California Hastings College of the Law, questioned whether the facts involved in the New York case would make a strong test case over encryption. While extracting data from the phone in the New York case would be an easier technical feat for Apple, the facts in the case are far less compelling, she said. \u201cIf you want to do a balancing test and you\u2019ve got terrorism on one side of the scale, that\u2019s a very heavy weight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the request is balanced when we have drugs on the other side.\u201d Apple is scheduled to file papers in opposition of the Justice Department's appeal by April 15. In its appeal, the Apple lawyer said the company would try the same thing it was planning in California: demanding that government show it had tried all possible alternative means of getting into the phone. That could force the FBI to reveal closely held details of its efforts to break into phones. Federal law enforcement officials declined to say whether they were looking into having third parties unlock the phone in the New York case. The phone in the Brooklyn case belonged to Jun Feng, who has pleaded guilty to participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy. The Justice Department is seeking to unlock Feng's phone to find other conspirators.

I've found that my ability to influence individuals and organizations has often propelled my success much more than my acquisition of technical skills and I wanted to shared these lessons learned with more women out there. On a personal level, I never saw gender as a factor in my influence strategy but once I started interviewing women from all levels of seniority across multiple geographies, several common challenges emerged: Despite having credentials, experience, domain expertise, and often seniority, women felt they were not being taken seriously by (mostly male) colleagues and their ideas were being appropriated by others.\u00a0 -\"Even though I am at a C-Suite level, in meetings my male counterparts often repeat what I am saying in a different way and take credit for my ideas\" -\"I have a seat at the table but I often feel overpowered by a louder voice (usually male) and many times I will say something / offer solutions and as if no one was listening, someone else (usually male) will say the same thing (sometimes even the same words?) and they will get the credit for the idea. It happens to me over and over\" These women aren't alone. A recent study of Supreme Court justices found that male justices interrupt the female justices approximately three times as often as they interrupt each other during oral arguments. They also found that gender carried 30x more power than seniority in one's chances of being interrupted. Ouch! [Related:\u00a0\u200bHow to Handle Being Manterrupted\u200b] Women often saw only the negative side of power and avoided engaging in strategies to further their interests. There was a common belief that being cooperative and collaborative was the right approach and that genuine effort will be recognized. Findings by Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever showed that mental barriers about asking for more were major drivers for women not negotiating. In fact, they found that men initiated negotiations to advance their own interests about four times as frequently as women. The HBR article Nice Girls Don't Ask\u00a0summarizes some of these findings and the reasons for them. Given that almost all organizations are political and it takes about 20 people on average to take a decision* in a large organization, it seemed that women were not setting themselves up for success by not looking at influence strategically. *Source: Strategic influence book Art of Woo, by Wharton professor Richard Shell Representation of leadership as a male trait in our society (89% of business school cases feature male protagonists and most business books are written by men and about men) gives women very limited examples as to what it means to be a leader. Being too nice results in not being taken seriously or being taken advantage of and being assertive leads to being perceived as aggressive and not likable. This has made projecting authority more complicated for women and left them with less options to exercise their influence. In addition, they often failed to utilize critical feminine skills like listening, empathizing and problem-solving, strategically. [Related:\u00a0\u200bWomen and Leadership: Defining 21st Century Progress\u200b] As I was doing my research for the course, I realized that all the books I was referencing about strategic influence were written by men and all the best Ivy League business classes on this topic were also taught by men (almost all white and middle-aged). They had a very male perspective and didn't take into account the challenges above. Sure enough, one case study did have a woman in it: she was Andy Grove's (Intel's CEO) secretary (!!!). After months of research and interviews, I am convinced that leadership development programs often let down women by telling them to adapt behaviors that work for men and failing to acknowledge women's unique challenges and needs. We don't need to empower women, we need to help them find paths to power through development that capitalizes on their strengths and provides strategic tools to navigate a work environment that is often biased against them. -- Miriam Grobman Consulting works with organizations that want to advance more talented women into leadership roles by breaking cultural barriers and giving them the right skills to be successful.

The State Department and the White House have taken striking steps to push Myanmar to punish those responsible for the crackdown. And on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans have rallied behind measures to increase pressure on Myanmar\u2019s leaders. President Donald Trump has been largely silent on the Rohingya so far. But the unlikely collaboration on one of the world\u2019s largest human rights crises could result in one of the few major international accomplishments of his time in office thus far \u2014 if Trump decides to personally join the effort, that is, and if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stops blocking votes on the issue. \u201cWe really think this could be a success story for the administration,\u201d said Francisco Bencosme, an advocacy official at the nonprofit group Amnesty International. \u201cThere\u2019s been high-level engagement. But at the same time, the buck stops with the president. We haven\u2019t seen President Trump speak out for the Rohingya. Until there\u2019s presidential leadership, we still think there\u2019s room for more.\u201d Myanmar\u2019s military and allied Buddhist militias killed and raped thousands of Rohingya last year after Rohingya militants attacked security outposts in August.\u00a0Some 700,000 members of the historically demonized ethnic and religious minority group fled from Myanmar\u2019s western Rakhine state to neighboring Bangladesh because of the violence.  Trump aides have been working to help the Rohingya refugees leave the cramped camps, rebuild their burned-down villages and gain the full citizenship rights they have been denied for decades. In October, the administration cut off U.S. assistance for Myanmar military officials involved in operations in Rakhine, and the following month it declared the assault \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d Trump placed sanctions on a prominent Myanmar general involved in the offensive in December. And last month, Reuters revealed\u00a0that a State Department team has been gathering Rohingya allegations of abuse that could be used for further sanctions and international prosecution of Myanmar officials.  \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of interest in the administration over this,\u201d Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for international religious freedom, told The Wall Street Journal\u00a0after visiting the camps in April. On Monday, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,\u00a0chastised Myanmar ally China for watering down a U.N. Security Council statement on the issue. At a refugee camp the next day, U.S. Agency for International Development chief Mark Green said the State Department will provide new policy recommendations to the president later this summer. He also announced $44 million more in U.S. humanitarian aid to feed and house the Rohingya, bringing the total to nearly $300 million.  The steps have won the Trump team uncommon praise from Congress, where parallel efforts are in the works. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a leader on the issue who led lawmakers on a trip to the region last year, said he was encouraged by both the State Department\u2019s use of the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d label and the tough language from Haley. \u201cThis is a massive case of horrific ethnic cleansing \u2014 and, some would say, a genocide,\u201d Merkley told HuffPost. \u201cIt was a horrific assault on these defenseless villages and America should be in the forefront of the world\u2019s action.\u201d Merkley has sponsored a Senate resolution urging the \u201csafe, dignified, voluntary and sustainable\u201d return of the Rohingya to Myanmar. Co-sponsored by six GOP senators, it\u2019s one of two bills on the situation that passed out of the Senate foreign relations committee this spring. The other, sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and supported by 19 other senators, makes similar demands and outlines procedures for pressuring Myanmar by placing sanctions on military officials and reducing U.S. purchases of the jade and rubies that are among its top exports. Both proposals have the support of the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, Sen. Dick Durbin (Ill.), who went on the trip with Merkley, and are linked to parallel legislation in the House. Support from Trump for those bills could help them overcome opposition from McConnell. The Senate majority leader is a longtime supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, the activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who was held under house arrest by Myanmar\u2019s military until 2010.\u00a0McConnell pushed hard for her release, and for the junta to begin loosening its grip on power. Now, Suu Kyi is the most powerful civilian in the country\u2019s government \u2015 but she\u2019s facing major international criticism for her failure to acknowledge the Rohingyas\u2019 suffering or publicly challenge Myanmar\u2019s generals. McConnell has said the U.S. should acknowledge the crisis but be wary of upending the power balance in the country. \u201cPublicly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi \u2014 the best hope for democratic reform in Burma \u2014 is not constructive,\u201d McConnell said in September, referring to Myanmar by its former name as U.S. officials often do. That argument has some powerful supporters within the State Department, which led an Obama-era policy of limited engagement that involved easing U.S. sanctions on the country as its military rulers made concessions like releasing Suu Kyi. The agency\u2019s top Asia official, acting Assistant Secretary Susan Thornton, is reluctant to publicly condemn Myanmar or China for fear of reducing U.S. influence over them or weakening Suu Kyi\u2019s position, Trump aides and congressional staffers say. Those working for the Rohingya see that thinking as outdated, given Suu Kyi\u2019s track record in recent years.  \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of Suu Kyi... all the Rohingya supported her,\u201d said Imam Abdul Malik Mujahid, an American Muslim leader involved in lobbying around the issue. But \u201cshe has enough authority and she doesn\u2019t do anything with it. We hope that McConnell will have a second look.\u201d  A strong statement from the White House might acknowledge that reality and trigger faster, stronger American action. Trump has not publicly spoken about the crisis despite private commitments during his first official trip to Asia last year. Merkley believes the lack of a presidential statement creates a global perception of indifference. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t know about it or, worse yet, knows about it and doesn\u2019t care about it, either one is an enormous failing,\u201d\u00a0he said. Spokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The situation may soon get worse because of monsoon season, which often brings cyclones and floods. Humanitarian groups are worried about its impact on the refugee camps in Bangladesh, and the possibility that a fresh catastrophe could exacerbate budding Bengali resentment toward the refugees. Meanwhile, Myanmar\u2019s government is dampening hopes of a peaceful return\u00a0by aggressively transforming the Rohingyas\u2019 homeland\u00a0and limiting supplies of food and medicine to those Rohingya who still live in the country. It has prevented United Nations officials, rights groups and the media from freely exploring the area \u2015 though some have snuck in to document ongoing government crackdowns, and Rohingya have been sharing accounts of arson and worsening poverty through social media.  Top congressional staff working on the issue discovered the lengths Myanmar\u2019s leaders would go to downplay abuses during a visit this spring, an aide told HuffPost: While they flew over Rakhine state, the windows on the government plane carrying them were blacked out so they could not see burned-out Rohingya villages. That only strengthened the feeling that something needs to change fast, the aide said. Officials and activists hope Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others close to Trump can get the issue on the president\u2019s radar soon, whether by using upcoming State Department reports \u2015 including one on whether the U.S.\u00a0believes Myanmar\u2019s actions constitute crimes against humanity \u2015 or just appealing to his political instincts. Taking action on Myanmar could allow Trump to depict himself as fixing one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s mistakes. There\u2019s increasing public skepticism\u00a0of Obama\u2019s 2012 decision to ease sanctions on Myanmar and stay relatively quiet about the persecution of the Rohingya in hopes of facilitating a transition to democracy.  The situation offers Trump a rare chance to win international acclaim by charting a different course on foreign policy from Obama.  It\u2019s not yet clear whether the president sees the opportunity.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Simpson Will Be A Free Man Very, Very Soon', body='LOS ANGELES (Reuters) \u2015 Onetime \u201cTrial of the Century\u201d defendant O.J. Simpson could be freed as early as Sunday from prison in Nevada, where he has been held since 2008 for a botched robbery, but the time and place of his release remain secret, his plans largely unknown. Simpson, 70, won his freedom from a Nevada parole board in July after nine years behind bars, at a hearing that did not take into account his 1990s trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a friend, Ron Goldman. The onetime football star turned actor and TV pitchman nicknamed \u201cThe Juice\u201d during his playing career was found not guilty in 1995 following that sensational, 13-month trial in Los Angeles, which was televised live daily, transfixing much of the nation. A civil court jury subsequently found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims\u2019 families, a judgment that remains largely unpaid. The Nevada Department of Corrections, seeking to avoid the kind of media frenzy that often accompanies Simpson, has declined to say exactly when and where he would be released. A department spokeswoman warned media not to try to chase his vehicle from the prison gates, saying officials could postpone the release for weeks if necessary to avoid \u201crisk to the community\u201d from such a frenzy. Also unclear is the former star athlete\u2019s ultimate destination. He told parole board members he hopes to move to Florida, where he has friends and family, a plan that must be approved by probation authorities there. During the parole hearing, Simpson joked that he was willing to stay in Nevada, but \u201cI\u2018m sure you don\u2019t want me here.\u201d His Las Vegas\u2013based attorney, Malcom LaVergne, reiterated the Florida plans during an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d program on Friday, adding that his client was looking forward to spending time with family members, eating steak and seafood and buying an iPhone. LaVergne could not be reached for comment by Reuters. Florida corrections officials say they had not received a parole transfer request for Simpson and had not been contacted by their counterparts in Nevada. Simpson is a native of California, born in San Francisco, and played his final years as a pro football player for that city\u2019s team, the 49ers. He lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murders. But California corrections officials say he has not filed papers to live in that state, either.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

But no matter what our eventual fate, I think it would do our souls good to at least try to slow down our self-destruction. After all, just because a penchant for murder and Kardashians seem to be inherent human flaws doesn't mean we shouldn't do our best to minimize them. I don't expect public opinion on climate change will be swayed by columnists and pundits preaching to their choirs. Those who want to ignore the vast scientific evidence on the subject have likely already skipped to the comment section below to try to convince you that since I'm not shouting these things naked from a wooden hut in the middle of a bog, I'm a hypocrite and deserve to be ignored.  For those still reading, I have a suggestion. Most of us don't have millions of dollars to go toe-to-toe with the disinformation campaign being waged by the oil and gas industry. But most of us do have living parents. So let's talk to them about climate change. Because if we can't convince the people who love us more than anything in the world to take action on climate, who can we convince?    It might be a hard conversation. They may be resistant, even hostile. But remember how many perspectiveless, entitled fits of angst they endured from you through your adolescence. You owe them some patience.  If you do accept this challenge, here are a few suggestions: 1) Speak from a place of love and compassion, not anger or self-righteousness. (side note on self-righteousness: if you've ever used the arrogant, poisonous term \"sheeple,\" please eliminate it from your vocabulary, you're making everything worse)  2) Make it clear that the topic of climate change is inseparable from the well-being of their children and grandchildren.  3) Share a couple of informative articles on the topic. Bill McKibben's landmark article in Rolling Stone, while harrowing, is concise and very readable. This NASA primer is also very good. There's no need to overwhelm them with data. If they want more information you can point them towards it. The most important thing for them to understand is that on our current path we may no longer have a climate that allows for stable, secure societies within the lifetimes of today's children. 4) Once these distressing facts are laid out, make clear that you aren't blaming them for this. Your parents likely made all of their decisions with a strong sense of morality and social responsibility, and could only make those decisions based on the information they had at the time. But now that you have provided this new information, talk about how it obligates them, and all of us, to behave in new ways. 5) Encourage them to buy environmentally-friendly goods and services as much as possible. Talk to them about divestment from fossil fuels. But given the urgency and enormity of the problem, also make clear that this will not be enough. This is a challenge that requires us all to act as citizens, not just as consumers. 6) Now comes the hardest part. If your parents want to align their actions with their concern for their children's and grandchildren's futures, they may need to change the way they vote (!!!). Any politicians (even good-looking ones) not advocating for drastic reductions in carbon emissions have, at best, not accepted the facts about climate change. At worst, they are knowingly and cynically sacrificing the future for their own wealth and power. There's a million ways your parents may rationalize doing nothing, but I won't waste time anticipating and countering those rationalizations because in the end the choice is simple: do they want to make the world a better place to live, or a worse place?  Remind them again that climate change and children are inseparable, and ask them to please care for each with equal passion. And give them a hug, because they'd probably like that!'}.

In an open letter Wednesday to the president-elect and Congress, scientists representing all 50 states called on the incoming administration to sufficiently fund scientific research as well as \u201csupport and rely on science as a key input for crafting public policy.\u201d Anything short of that, they stressed, is a direct threat to the health and safety of Americans and people around the world. \u201cThe consequences are real: without this investment, children will be more vulnerable to lead poisoning, more people will be exposed to unsafe drugs and medical devices, and we will be less prepared to limit the impacts of increasing extreme weather and rising seas,\u201d the letter reads.\u00a0 The letter, organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, comes amid growing concern about what a Trump presidency will mean for combatting today\u2019s environmental challenges, namely climate change. \u00a0 Trump and his fellow climate deniers\u00a0have made it quite clear where they stand on the phenomenon and funding its continued study. Trump has dismissed climate change as \u201cbullshit\u201d and a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and promised to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement. He has also said he would\u00a0cut all federal spending on the issue, increase America\u2019s production of coal, oil and natural gas, and\u00a0do away with Obama administration regulations\u00a0aimed at cutting emissions. \u00a0 In the weeks since the election, Trump has only added to scientists\u2019 concerns\u00a0by selecting\u00a0climate change denier Myron Ebell and fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to lead transition work at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy.\u00a0Former Alaska Gov.

The famed instant photography brand, which has struggled to break into the era of Instagram, will debut a new iPhone app on Tuesday that allows users to publish and view second-long video clips. It\u2019s called \u201cPolaroid Swing,\u201d and Apple is expected to prominently feature it in its iOS App Store after launch. It\u2019s free to download. The brief clips are a bit similar to the iPhone 6S\u2019s \u201clive photos,\u201d but they\u2019re smoother to operate and live in their own social network. This is what they look like: Mouse over them or move your finger across the image and you\u2019ll see how the animation works. The app is a natural fit on the iPhone (though an Android version is in development): Apple co-founder Steve Jobs lionized Edwin H. Land, the founder of Polaroid who is credited with inventing \u201cinstant photography.\u201d According to a piece in Forbes, Jobs was inspired by a story about how Land came up with the idea for the Polaroid camera. Apparently, Land\u2019s young daughter asked why she couldn\u2019t see a picture right after it was taken. Land went for a walk and dreamed up the famous instant camera. He would go on to tell Jobs that at the time,\u00a0\u201cI could see what the Polaroid camera should be. It was just as real to me as if it were sitting in front of me before I had ever built one.\u201d After hearing this story, Jobs\u00a0reportedly told former Apple CEO John Sculley that he conceptualized Apple products in a similar way. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I walk into a room and I want to talk about a product that hasn\u2019t been invented yet,\u201d said Jobs, per Forbes. \u201cI can see the product as if it\u2019s sitting there right in the center of the table. It\u2019s like what I\u2019ve got to do is materialize it and bring it to life\u2014harvest it just like Dr. Land said.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, neither Jobs nor Land needed to propel an app into the ultra-crowded marketplace of 2016, where the attention of jaded consumers is anything but guaranteed. That\u2019s a job for Frederick Blackford and Tommy Stadlen, the minds behind the new Polaroid app. \u201dSocial networks are like parties, and people get bored and leave parties,\u201d Stadlen told The Huffington Post in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire for people to express themselves in new ways.\u201d He might be onto something. People are reportedly sharing less \u201cpersonal\u201d content on Facebook and Instagram. Snapchat basically reinvented itself last week with the addition of a \u201cMemories\u201d feature, which changes how you share content on the platform. People might be ready for something new. Yes, the new Polaroid app will feel familiar \u2015 its scrolling feed is a lot like Instagram, and you follow people much the same way \u2015 but there are differences in the details. When you scroll, the clips move like the little photographs in Harry Potter\u2019s newspapers.\u00a0You\u2019re encouraged to touch and interact with the images, because it\u2019s hard to fully take them in at first glance. Stadlen says the aim is to emulate how people experience memories. \u201cHuman beings perceive the world not in stills, not in video, but in these moments,\u201d Stadlen said. \u201cMemories move, so photos should move too.\u201d \u201cThis was an exercise in creating a medium,\u201d Blackford added. Another thing they created: A new metric to measure success on the Polaroid Swing platform. It\u2019s called \u201cPulse.\u201d Blackford and Stadlen didn\u2019t offer many details about it, but they did say it measures \u201chow effectively ideas and images spread\u201d through the platform. You\u2019ll see the number represented next to a little diamond in your Polaroid Swing feed. As for what comes next, Stadlen hinted that a new Polaroid device could be coming soon, though the app is the primary focus for now.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Shark Shield shares her confidence. The company announced this week that it will give 30% off its Shark Shield Surf 7 device to the first 300 surfers willing to get back in the shark-infested waters of Reunion Island. Reunion Island, near Madagascar, banned swimming, body boarding and surfing this summer after suffering 10 shark attacks in two years, three of which were fatal, including the death of a 15-year-old girl and a famous local surfer.  The ban was lifted Oct. 1, and by encouraging surfers to get back in the water using its product, Shark Shield is employing a high-stakes publicity strategy that could either pay off swimmingly or backfire bloodily.  The Shark Shield uses two wave-emitting electrodes that create a protective field around a swimmer, diver or surfer. Sharks have gel-filled sacs called Ampullae of Lorenzini, which they use to sense electrical fields given off by possible prey. When a shark senses the electric wave caused by the Shark Shield, the intense discomfort causes the shark to swim away.  The product comes in three versions, one that attaches to a diver or fisherman\u2019s ankle, another that mounts on a board, and a third specifically designed for military or technical divers.   The company claims that in a 2012 study in South Africa, a seal decoy hanging off a boat caused 16 great white shark breaches. After scientists turned on a Shark Shield, the decoy was used again and no sharks breached.  Watch video of a diver using the Shark Shield to deter various sharks, including a Great White.\n Along with the swimming and surfing ban, Reunion Island simultaneously implemented a widely-criticized shark culling program, planning to kill 90 sharks in an effort to curb attacks. Shark Shield sees its product not only as a lifesaver for humans but also for sharks.

The cases focus on the broad-ranging power wielded by the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the landmark  Clean Air Act, first enacted in 1970. The law was envisioned as a cooperative effort between the  federal government and states in which the EPA sets standards  but states have to set plans to comply. That flexibility has allowed states which favor looser  regulations, like Texas and Kansas, to resist - with the support  of industry groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the  National Association of Manufacturers - when the agency wants to  impose more stringent standards. In both cases before the conservative-leaning Supreme Court,  mainly Republican-led states and industry groups have challenged  different EPA regulations, in the hope of weakening the agency's  authority. The EPA has support from Democratic-leaning states,  like Massachusetts and New York, and from environmental groups. \"It would be both a big deal and somewhat unsurprising if  EPA loses both Clean Air Act cases,\" said Richard Frank, an  environmental law professor at the University of California at  Davis School of Law. Such rulings would reflect a dilution of  the deference that courts generally show government agencies in  interpreting statutes, he added. The cases do not challenge whether the EPA can regulate  pollutants, such as greenhouse gases, but instead how it uses  the Clean Air Act to regulate a wide range of them. The EPA's authority to interpret the statute broadly is  vital to its mission in the face of resistance from Republicans  and a handful of Democrats in Congress and some state  governments. In the climate change context in particular, the  Clean Air Act is the EPA's main tool for tackling greenhouse gas  emissions after the U.S. Senate rejected a cap-and-trade bill in  2010. The Supreme Court rulings are unlikely to have a direct  impact on President Barack Obama's sweeping Climate Action Plan,  which was unveiled in June, legal experts say, in part because  the EPA will be using its authority under parts of the law not  at issue in the cases. But decisions against the EPA could pose  obstacles to the way it rolls out its rules. In the first case, to be argued on Dec. 10, the nine  justices will consider the legality of a rule that regulates air  pollution that crosses state lines. The second case, expected to be scheduled for oral argument  in February, concerns a challenge to the Obama administration's  first wave of regulations targeting heat-trapping greenhouse  gases. The court is due to issue rulings in both cases by the end  of June. INTER-STATE POLLUTION The EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, meant to take  effect in January 2012, would have set limits on nitrogen oxides  and sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants in 28 states  that emit pollutants in the eastern part of the country that  directly affect air quality in other states, generally referred  to as \"upwind states.\" An alliance of industry groups and 15 states, in addition to  companies like Southern Co, Peabody Energy Corp   and American Electric Power Inc, challenged the rule,  and it was never implemented. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit determined in August 2012 that the  rule was invalid on multiple grounds. Under the worst-case scenario for the government, the  Supreme Court could weaken the EPA's power to bring recalcitrant  states into line, legal experts said. In the Obama administration's petition asking for Supreme  Court review of the cross-state rule, Solicitor General Donald  Verrilli said that if the D.C. Circuit decision stood, it would  \"gravely undermine\" enforcement of the Clean Air Act, delaying  the ability of downwind states to comply with air standards and  making it nearly impossible for those states to meet deadlines. A ruling against the EPA could also encourage states to  resist other EPA proposals. \"If the Supreme Court pushes back against the EPA and says  the EPA has to give the states the first chance to address the  problem, that gives the states more leverage,\" said Jonathan  Martel, a partner at law firm Arnold & Porter LLP, who  represents business interests in air pollution cases. CLIMATE CHANGE RULES In the climate change case, the Supreme Court agreed last  month to consider a single question of the many raised by nine  different coalitions of industry groups, such as the American  Petroleum Institute, and 16 states, including Texas and  Virginia. They appealed a June 2012 ruling by the appeals court  in Washington upholding the first suite of EPA rules aimed at  tackling climate change. The justices will weigh only whether the agency has  authority to regulate greenhouse gases under a permitting  program for stationary sources of pollution. A loss for the EPA could remove a whole category of  pollutants, not just greenhouse gases, from the so-called  \"prevention of serious deterioration\" or PSD program, which  requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain  a permit before any new construction is done if it emits \"any  air pollutant.\" Under the program, the operators have to show that they are  using the best available technology available to reduce  emissions of the covered pollutants. It may not be all bad news for the EPA. The court passed up  a chance to review the agency's determination that greenhouse  gases, the driving force behind climate change, are a pollutant  that needs to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Wins for the EPA in both cases would not, however, lead to  any major shift in the law in its favor, experts say. \"Everything continues to be hard work\" for the EPA, said  Sean Donahue, an attorney who represents the Environmental  Defense Fund. \"There's tremendous resistance at every turn.\"     (Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by  Ros Krasny, Howard Goller and Nick Zieminski)'}.

But the long hours dedicated to research eventually left her feeling socially isolated and physically weak. Taking up a habit of regularly visiting the gym changed all that \u2014 so profoundly that she decided to also change the focus of her studies and become a beginner researcher in the neuroscience of exercise at 51 years old. That meant giving up the reputation she had built over 25 years to enter a field where no one knew her. \u201cIt was a hard decision and it was scary,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cBut once I made the decision I knew it was the right one.\u201d She also thought it was a particularly good decision because the results of her work, which focuses on understanding the effects of exercise on the brain, could quickly\u00a0lead to tangible benefits. \u201cThe thing that was really exciting and appealing is that this was the kind of research that could immediately be applied to helping people live their life better,\u201d she said.\u00a0 We\u2019ve long known that exercise makes for a healthier, fitter body. But its similar effects on the brain have only come to light in recent years. In fact, just the idea that the brain can change at all in response to experiences is something that had not garnered much evidence until the late 20th century. One of the first experiments to show the flexibility of the brain was done in 1972, when researchers put mice in a fun cage equipped with running wheels and toys, and found the cortex area of the rodents\u2019 brains grew thicker, whereas it didn\u2019t in mice kept in a dull, small cage. Later it was found that although we are endowed with a set amount of long-lasting neurons, new neurons could still be born in adulthood. More importantly, this occurs in the hippocampus, a critical structure for memory and learning. And what can boost the generation of new neurons there? Aerobic exercise. The hippocampus is one of the primary targets of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s. So building up the hippocampus over a lifetime could potentially delay the effects of diseases. \u201cExercise is not going to cure Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia but it anatomically strengthens two of the key targets of both those diseases, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cYour hippocampus will be bigger if you exercise regularly, so that means that it\u2019s going to take that much longer for the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer\u2019s disease to cause behavioral effects. That means months, or hopefully years, of higher cognitive function.\u201d The creation of new neurons, or neurogenesis, doesn\u2019t happen overnight, however. Neurons don\u2019t just pop up fully formed and fully integrated. They are born as immature cells and take several months to grow. But that\u2019s not to say that all positive effects will be delayed by three or four months if you start exercising now. As many people have noticed\u00a0firsthand, exercising also makes the mind sharper and attention more focused. That\u2019s because another brain area heavily affected by aerobic exercise is the prefrontal cortex, an area in charge of high-level cognition, executive functions, decision-making and attention.\u00a0 Exactly how it happens is not fully known, but it seems that the prefrontal cortex is actually relaxing during intense physical activity. It then gets a rebound increase in blood flow after the exercise, enabling it to work at full speed. It\u2019s also possible that the same bodily changes that help new neurons grow in the hippocampus are also at work in the prefrontal cortex and help grow glial cells and blood vessels. So which type of exercise is best from the brain\u2019s point of view? Here\u2019s what we can tell from research so far: Mood: Walking, aerobic exercise and high-intensity interval training can improve your mood. \u201cWe recently did a study comparing the three. All three of them improved mood but the one that did the most was walking. That\u2019s good news for people who don\u2019t have a high-level aerobic regime on hand,\u201d Suzuki said.\u00a0 Memory: The best evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis is continuous aerobic exercise. \u201cYou have to get your heart rate up. So a good 45-minute workout,\u201d Suzuki said. Attention: Aerobic exercise is again the best option if you want to boost attention. But unlike with memory, the improvements are more acute and come faster. Jogging, biking and treadmill running are all good options for getting a boost in the prefrontal cortex.\u00a0'}.

Once it is exposed, Apple should be able to plug the encryption hole, comforting iPhone users worried that losing physical possession of their devices will leave them vulnerable to hackers. When Apple does fix the flaw, it is expected to announce it to customers and thereby extend the rare public battle over security holes, a debate that typically rages out of public view. The Federal Bureau of Investigation last week dropped its courtroom quest to force Apple to hack into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, saying an unidentified party provided a method for getting around the deceased killer's unknown passcode. If the government pursues a similar case seeking Apple\u2019s help in New York, the court could make the FBI disclose its new trick. But even if the government walks away from that battle, the growing number of state and local authorities seeking the FBI\u2019s help with locked phones in criminal probes increases the likelihood that the FBI will have to provide it. When that happens, defense attorneys will cross-examine the experts involved. Although each lawyer would mainly be interested in whether evidence-tampering may have occurred, the process would likely reveal enough about the method for Apple to block it in future versions of its phones, an Apple employee said. \"The FBI would need to resign itself to the fact that such an exploit would only be viable for a few months, if released to other departments,\" said Jonathan Zdziarski, an independent forensics expert who has helped police get into many devices. \"It would be a temporary Vegas jackpot that would quickly get squandered on the case backlog.\" In a memo to police obtained by Reuters on Friday, the FBI said it would share the tool \"consistent with our legal and policy constraints.\" Even if the FBI hoards the information - despite a White House policy that tilts toward disclosure to manufacturers - if it is not revealed to Apple, there are other ways the method could come to light or be rendered ineffective over time, according to Zdziarski and senior Apple engineers who spoke on condition of anonymity. The FBI may use the same method on phones in cases in which the suspects are still alive, presenting the same opportunity for defense lawyers to pry. In addition, the contractor who sold the FBI the technique might sell it to another agency or country. The more widely it circulates, the more likely it will be leaked. \u201cFlaws of this nature have a pretty short life cycle,\u201d one senior Apple engineer said. \u201cMost of these things do come to light.\u201d The temporary nature of flaws is borne out in the pricing of tools for exploiting security holes in the government-dominated market for \u201czero-days,\u201d called that because the companies whose products are targets have had zero days\u2019 warning of the flaw. Many of the attack programs that are sold to defense and intelligence contractors and then to government buyers are purchased over six months, with payments spaced apart in case the flaw is discovered or the hole is patched incidentally with an update from the manufacturer, market participants told Reuters. Although Apple is concerned about consumer perception, employees said the company had made no major recent changes in policy. Instead, its engineers take pride in the fact that a program for breaking into an iPhone via the web was recently purchased by a defense contractor for $1 million, and that even that program is likely to be short-lived. They said most iPhone users have more to fear from criminals than from countries, and few crooks can afford anything like what it costs to break into a fully up-to-date iPhone.'}.

Erik, even at the darkest points of his \u201cincel-ar period,\u201d as he calls it, says he never contemplated anything violent.  But his experience \u2014 how he gathered contempt for the people he wanted to sleep with and, eventually, got over it \u2014 says a lot about what\u2019s really behind the incel phenomenon and why it seems to be getting worse.\u00a0 Erik\u2019s radicalization began five years ago, when his family fell behind on bills and he had to take a second job to help them catch up. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the time or the money to go out and meet people because I was always working,\u201d he says. He was 23 years old, living with his parents, doing day shifts at a big-box retail store and nights at a call center, dialing for political donations. \u201cI felt isolated and alone and crippled. The resentment started with myself. I would think, \u2018What did you do to deserve this?\u2019 Then the self-loathing became loathing of everyone around me: \u2018Why am I propping up this family?\u2019\u201d He describes a widening circle of resentment. He had no time for dates and no car for hookups. His first (and only) sexual experience had been a one-night stand, some dude he met on Facebook while studying abroad. His attempts at flirting in bars ended badly. One guy, whom Erik describes as \u201cdiva-pretty,\u201d once told him, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even rape you.\u201d He had started to think of the men he was attracted to \u2014 \u201cslim, pretty-faced guys who looked like they had a lot of money, who lived that West Hollywood lifestyle, who could eat whatever they wanted and never gain a single pound\u201d \u2014 as the cause of his failures. They were shallow, superficial, hoarding status and sex and power and denying it to him. \u201cThe ones I hated the most,\u201d he says, \u201cwere the gorgeous, white, rich gay men on Instagram saying, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to love your body\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s not about what\u2019s on the outside.\u2019 I would be like, fuck you. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be rejected. You haven\u2019t weighed more than 100 pounds in the last 30 years.\u201d I tell Erik that he doesn\u2019t strike me as the kind of guy who would actually enjoy the \u201cWest Hollywood\u201d lifestyle all that much. VIP rooms, bottle service, duckface selfies? \u201cWeren\u2019t you just telling me that your ideal gay bar was somewhere you could wear a tux and sing show tunes?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt was more about attaining status than finding love or even sex,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though I didn\u2019t actually want the lifestyle they were broadcasting, I wanted to feel worthy of having it \u2014 as affirmed by others. I wanted to be the alpha male.\u201d What\u2019s at the heart of Erik\u2019s experience, and the incel phenomenon more generally, says Jennifer Bosson, a masculinity researcher at the University of South Florida, is the concept of \u201cprecarious masculinity.\u201d  \u201cManhood is conceptualized as something that has to be earned,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd once you earn it, you have to defend it. It can be lost.\u201d Look at almost any culture, she adds, and you\u2019ll find that men, as a group, have higher status than women. But within men there are huge disparities. Cars, clothes, jawlines: Some guys have them and some don\u2019t. For the have-nots, it feels like they\u2019re not reaping the benefits of being in the dominant group, like they\u2019re being denied what\u2019s owed to them. \u201cWhen women lack power we\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh I\u2019m a woman,\u2019\u201d Bosson says. \u201cWhen men lack power, they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d In other words, the incel phenomenon has nothing to do with sex \u2014 duh \u2014 and everything to do with entitlement. My personal theory is that it was the online forums, the constantly updated cheering section of like-minded misanthropes, that turned people like Minassian into monsters. Though he doesn\u2019t know of any dedicated message boards for gay incels, Erik still managed to find places where he could voice his resentments and get them reflected back to him. His forum of choice, he says, was \u201cthe scariest place on the Internet: The YouTube comments section.\u201d He found articles and videos that critiqued gay male beauty standards, then scrolled down until he found snark and resentments that echoed his own. \u201cIt\u2019s like, hey, this person is dejected and unfucked as well. We have something in common, we can share our loathing of people we perceive to be the problem.\u201d He shows me screenshots of what this looked like. \u201cYour issues with body image are not the same as those of objectively ugly people, like myself,\u201d is how one of the comments on a YouTube video begins. Another, a Twitter thread, starts with a message to a model tweeting about his mental illness: \u201chow nice of a conventionally hot/pretty boy to tell us regular folk with our plain looks, mediocre sex lives, & non-Adonis figures such Noble sentiments.\u201d Seeing these echoes of his own experience, he says, felt like relief, like he wasn\u2019t alone anymore. The more he built fellowship with the guys from the comment threads, the more he started to see his life in us-versus-them terms. He started celebrating the misfortunes of his online enemies. \u201cSomeone posts about their breakup on social media and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh look, the pretty person feels sad. They have no chance of getting anyone else, boo hoo.\u2019\u201d Some of the people he met online actually seemed happy, cheering on the misfortune of the pretty people, he says. Teach that narcissistic little fucker that life doesn\u2019t revolve around him. \u201cI was being just as judgmental and shallow as I thought the enemy was,\u201d he reflects. \u201cThe irony never occurred to me.\u201d Curtis Puryear, a colleague of Bosson\u2019s who specializes in online radicalization, tells me Erik followed a fairly typical pattern. Whether online or offline, being around like-minded people tends to result in having stronger views. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or someone who thinks \u201cCrash\u201d shouldn\u2019t have won an Oscar, being around a bunch of people with the same opinion usually makes you feel it more intensely. The internet, Puryear says, allows you to find people and activate identities you never could if you had to rely on face-to-face interactions. If you live in a small town (like Erik does), it\u2019s pretty hard to find enough fellow incels to form a community. On the internet, though, nearly any identity can become the basis for sharing empathy, information \u2014 and grievances. \u201cFeeling like you\u2019re a member of a disadvantaged group brings some psychological benefits,\u201d Puryear continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to write off failures. You feel like the deck is stacked against you. If you\u2019re an incel and you feel attacked, then that identity will become more important for you over time.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 One of the stories about Elliot Rodger I can\u2019t get out of my head dates back to the summer before his shooting rampage. Rodger saw a group of women playing kickball in a park. According to Ralph W. Larkin\u2019s \u201cLearning to Be a Rampage Shooter,\u201d Rodger immediately left, bought a Super Soaker, filled it with orange juice and came back. He ran onto the field and hosed down the players. He had no goal other than ruining their fun. \u201cThey deserved to die horrible, painful deaths,\u201d he wrote later about the women, \u201cjust for the crime of enjoying a better life than me.\u201d I ask Erik whether he ever lashed out like this, even in small ways. He says he didn\u2019t. He tells me that when his co-workers used to complain about gaining weight, he would ask them if they wanted to trade bodies with him.  \u201cIt was my way of saying, \u2018Shut up, I don\u2019t want to hear any complaining from conventionally attractive people,\u2019\u201d he says. Pretty dickish, he admits, but a far cry from even the warning signs of the violence that people like Rodger have carried out. I ask Bosson about this, whether something about gayness keeps gay men from lashing out the way straight men do. She points out, first, that only a small percentage of men are gay \u2014 maybe there\u2019s fewer gay mass shooters because there\u2019s fewer of us overall. \u00a0\u00a0 And it\u2019s not like gayness grants immunity from masculinity norms. \u201cWe see the same valorizing of \u2018straight-acting\u2019 and stigmatization of femininity in gay men that we see in straight men,\u201d Bosson says, confirming what you already know if you\u2019ve spent more than five minutes on Grindr.  And masculinity is inextricably linked to violence. Bosson\u2019s lab runs studies where they threaten men\u2019s status by making them braid a mannequin\u2019s hair or telling them they got \u201ca typical female score\u201d on a knowledge test. Afterward, the men hit a punching bag harder and blasted their fellow research subjects (well, a simulation of them) with higher levels of punitive white noise than men whose masculinity hadn\u2019t been challenged. \u201cIf you threaten men\u2019s sense of their gender status and make them feel for a moment that they\u2019re not a real man, they lash out,\u201d she says. For men who feel like their sense of masculinity is under constant threat \u2014 like being unemployed or, ahem, not getting laid \u2014 it may take smaller and smaller threats to provoke their anger. It took a response from his targets for Erik\u2019s five-year \u201cincel-ar period\u201d to become something else. While most of the porn stars and Insta-gays blocked him after he sent them the \u201cfuckboy\u201d message, some replied. \u201cI am poor as fuck,\u201d one of them wrote. \u201cAbout to lose my cheap apartment. I have til the end of the month to move out. Looks are not everything.\u201d Erik shows me screenshots. \u201cSorry,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0... it must be nice to be gay and hot and have some of the best sex on the planet.\u201d \u201cI have not had sex since October of last year. It was not hot or fun,\u201d the porn star wrote. And, to Erik\u2019s apology, \u201cIf you continue acting that way, you will have nothing. Like I have nothing.\u201d He got other responses, too. After he copy-pasted his message to a porn producer and got blocked, Erik contacted him on Snapchat to apologize. The producer explained that lots of porn was fake (gasp) and that the actors making it were people, too. Another \u201cenemy\u201d who got Erik\u2019s message posted it on Twitter and said that his life might look perfect on the outside, but he was struggling with drug addiction and had been abandoned by his family. Eric felt traumatized, overwhelmed with guilt over what he had done. That\u2019s when the fog started to lift. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make me feel better automatically. But I started to think that if these guys were conventionally attractive and have what I\u2019m supposed to have and they\u2019re still miserable, then maybe I don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d \u201cSo the happy ending is that everyone is miserable?\u201d I ask. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s like I spent years collecting stamps, building up this whining and resentment. When I could have just accepted that I wasn\u2019t in grad school and working these mediocre jobs.\u201d  He\u2019s dating someone now, a retail clerk he met on OKCupid right after he decided to trade Twitter DMs for an OKCupid profile. (\u201cSneak that into your article somehow,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom incel to excel.\u201d) They\u2019ve been together two months now, but he\u2019s having trouble shedding his old habits. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve improved and am content now that I found someone who not only I like but who actually thinks I\u2019m beautiful,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the envy and resentment are still there.\u201d Envy, he says, because other people still look so attractive. Resentment because he thinks he never will.  Although he\u2019s different than Rodgers and Minassian, Erik\u2019s anger, too, came from a mismatch between expectations and reality: \u201cIf this was pre-1980s, maybe I\u2019d feel more different from a straight incel,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with the mainstreaming of gay people, the expectations have become more mainstream too. You\u2019re expected to be financially stable, to look a certain way, to have the right partner and the right hookups. When you can\u2019t live up to that image, then the inferiority complex comes.\u201d Erik is the first gay incel I\u2019ve ever met. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be the last. '}.

Their leaders tried to\u00a0persuade Trump not to abandon it. The E.U. was Iran\u2019s largest trade partner until 2012, when the Obama administration cobbled together a massive international sanctions regime on the Islamic Republic \u2015 even bringing along China and Russia \u2015 to force it to make concessions on the nuclear issue. Since the deal went into effect in 2016, lifting some sanctions in exchange for Iran opening up its nuclear facilities for inspections and accepting limits on its enrichment of uranium, Europe-Iran trade\u00a0has mushroomed\u00a0and companies based in the E.U.\u00a0have signed deals worth billions of dollars with Tehran. By reimposing American sanctions, Trump placed those companies at risk because the U.S. might crack down on them in the America-centric global financial system and technology trade. The administration has given companies in different sectors different windows of between three and six months to cut off business with Iran. Bolton\u2019s comments confirmed that after that, Trump is willing to subject them to penalties. \u201cThe consequences of American sanctions go way beyond goods shipped by American companies because of our technology licenses to many other countries and businesses around the world.\u00a0 As those sanctions kick in, it will have an even broader effect as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Europeans will see that it\u2019s in their interest, ultimately, to come along with us.\u201d European officials are brainstorming ways to protect their countries\u2019 business interests in Iran and also preserve the deal\u2019s procedures to prevent Iranian nuclear weapons development by keeping economic benefits to the country flowing. But the Trump administration appears to agree with outside critics of the deal who say the Europeans will eventually realize the U.S. market is more important to them \u2015 and give up on the landmark accord. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants a \u201cbetter\u201d deal\u00a0with Iran on the nuclear issue.\u00a0 But allies\u2019 increasing skepticism\u00a0of any commitments by Trump and the way the weakening of the deal helps hard-liners in the Iranian government make it hard to imagine successful negotiations.\u00a0 \u201cDiplomacy isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s strong suit,\u201d\u00a0Stimson Center arms control expert Michael Krepon\u00a0wrote\u00a0recently. \u201cTrashing Barack Obama\u2019s accomplishments is.\u201d Bolton on Sunday reiterated the administration line that the U.S.\u00a0wants to work with its partners in new ways to counter a whole range of Iranian activity \u2015 from its nuclear development to its support for forces around the Middle East that often work against American interests. He also sought to dampen concerns that he might push Trump to use U.S. force for regime change in Iran, saying that was his view while he was out of government.'}.

Nestled in between events that require athletes to hurl themselves from the tops of mountains and launch themselves into the air with blades attached to their feet, curling functions as a mental reprieve for those of us who are more athletically challenged. There\u2019s something wonderfully ordinary about men and women of varying levels of fitness playing glorified shuffleboard on ice. However, as comparatively undemanding as curling is on the body, the same cannot be said for the curling stones themselves. It turns out there are very few types of rock in existence that can withstand the stress of gliding along melting ice and smashing into more rock. Most granite is too quartz-rich for it to withstand the impact under curling conditions, which is what makes the granite found on a tiny deserted island off the Scottish coast so special. Ailsa Craig is 10 miles west of mainland Scotland \u2013 and while it was once inhabited by Catholics who sought refuge during the Scottish Reformation, it is now an unpopulated safe haven for various birds and serves as the world\u2019s only source for the\u00a0rare granite that is used to make Olympic curling stones. Also known as \u201cPaddy\u2019s milestone,\u201d the island is actually a volcanic plug \u2013 a literal rock formed over an extinct volcano. And it turns out that the unique makeup of the rock left behind is uniquely suited for making curling stones. There are three subgroups of the water-resistant microgranite that can can be mined from the island: Ailsa Craig Common Green Granite, Ailsa Craig Blue Hone Granite and Ailsa Craig Red Hone Granite. Kays of Scotland\u00a0has been making curling stones since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, which is why it has provided the stones for every single competition at the Olympic Winter Games. About every 10 years, Kays extracts several thousand tons of the distinctive blue and green varieties. The blue hone, whose tight molecular structure makes it impervious to water and melting ice, is used for the insert and running band of the stone, while the green granite makes up the body.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Trapped Inside The Monster Energy Frat House', body='A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.  The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an \u201cevening nightcap\u201d in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.  Robert Duck, Simmons\u2019 direct boss who works out of Monster\u2019s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said. \u201cHe said Ted was harmless, \u2018a dirty old man,\u2019\u201d Simmons recalled.  Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained.\u00a0When reached by phone by HuffPost,\u00a0he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.\u00a0 Simmons took her complaints no further. \u201cWhat was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,\u201d she said.  Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women. \u201cI knew saying things gets you retaliation.\u201d What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women. \u00a0 Last April,\u00a0Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn\u2019t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January. One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company. Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in. In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.  \u201cMonster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,\u201d the company said in January. \u201cMonster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.\u201d Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company\u2019s board of directors. \u201cWe are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,\u201d Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that \u201cin the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it\u00a0is prudent.\u201d The company declined to provide more details on the third party. \u201cIf there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,\u201d Sacks and Schlosberg said. In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn\u2019t aware of Simmons\u2019 complaints until recently. \u00a0 \u201cMs. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,\u201d the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Simmons\u2019 former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, is still working at Monster. \u00a0 Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons\u2019 account was \u201cnot accurate.\u201d Simmons\u2019 last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote: \u201cMany of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.\u201d  After reading HuffPost\u2019s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook \u2015 well before Simmons started working under him.  In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance. Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired. \u00a0 Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called \u201cAssault.\u201d A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick. That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster\u2019s employee guidelines \u2015 reviewed by HuffPost \u00a0\u2015 require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons\u2019 case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook\u2019s conduct. \u00a0 Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously. \u00a0 At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.  Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out \u2015 particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked. \u00a0\u00a0 Overall, only 13 percent of the company\u2019s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company\u2019s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.  Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said \u201cmany women hold top leadership positions within Monster,\u201d and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre. Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas \u2015 even with human resource representatives in attendance \u2015 a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.  The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull: \u201cLet\u2019s run down there and fuck a cow.\u201d Old bull says, nah: \u201cLet\u2019s walk down there and fuck them all.\u201d It was meant to inspire. Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.  Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division. Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company\u2019s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.  She didn\u2019t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook\u2019s efforts to \u201cget her drunk,\u201d she said. She declined his invitations for a \u201cnightcap\u201d in his hotel room.  \u201cThe more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,\u201d Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn\u2019t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said. \u201cHe said, \u2019I felt that,\u201d Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest. \u00a0 Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company. Huffpost obtained Zeringue\u2019s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as \u201cTouchy Ted\u201d around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said. The HR department reached out to Cook\u2019s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost\u2019s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were \u201cno noted recurrences,\u201d according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost. Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her \u201cperformance is not where it needs to be,\u201d he is quoted as saying.  When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said \u201che learned his lesson,\u201d according to internal notes. He also conceded that \u201ctouchy Ted\u201d was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being \u201cUncle Ted.\u201d He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called \u201cstop sexual harassment training for supervisors,\u201d and given a warning. It\u2019s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track. Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration \u2015 outside the public court system. It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about \u201chaving to go to HR classes,\u201d if they misbehaved. \u201cIt was just like a big joke,\u201d Simmons said Simmons\u2019 last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.  In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.  What happened next came as a total shock. Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.  \u201cFor stuff I didn\u2019t do,\u201d Simmons said. The writeup \u2015 which HuffPost has reviewed \u2015 \u00a0claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup. \u201cI was out of town every week,\u201d she said. The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company\u2019s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document. Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons\u2019 performance as \u201cMeets Standards,\u201d giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.  \u201cAt this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,\u201d Duck wrote. \u201cShe also needs a little more work on time management.\u201d \u00a0He called her a \u201cgreat problem solver,\u201d who sometimes needs help prioritizing, \u201cI have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it\u2026\u201d In the category of \u201cjob knowledge and skill,\u201d Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.  She cried.  \u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details. \u201cHe said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,\u201d Simmons said. For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons\u2019 direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn\u2019t respond to texts or calls. One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons\u2019 Dec. 31 performance review \u2015 topping the document off with an extremely harsh \u201csummary paragraph\u201d slamming her for poor performance.  The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document. \u201cAt this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to \u2018fix\u2019 this soon or she will struggle,\u201d Duck wrote. \u201cKaren acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.\u201d Duck used gender-coded words like \u201cabrasive\u201d and \u201cdemanding\u201d to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with. The final comment was meant to assess Simmons\u2019 work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost.\u00a0\u201cThe final comments reflect not only her manager\u2019s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.\u201d Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.  Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review,\u00a0claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph.\u00a0However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster\u2019s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 \u2015 two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.\u00a0 Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.  She was fired. \u201cIt was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,\u201d Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer. She was offered two weeks severance \u2015 if she signed a document promising not to sue. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo weeks pay for what they did is wrong.\u201d Zeringue \u00a0\u2015 the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier \u2015 also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too. Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It\u2019s unclear why. His colleagues threw him a going away party.  And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster\u2019s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.  Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn\u2019t working. \u201cThe first six months were awful,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I needed to go out, I\u2019d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.\u201d Because she lost her job, Simmons\u2019 husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it\u2019s unclear when he can come home. \u00a0 \u201cThis has affected my marriage, my life. It\u2019s been really tough on my family,\u201d she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter. \u201cMy daughter worries all the time. I told her don\u2019t worry about it; we\u2019ll figure a way around it.\u201d Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace?

And that\u2019s just one branch of science. Somewhere on your upper arm is a tiny scar that represents your vaccination against tuberculosis \u2014 the White Death, a plague that claimed the lives of one in five young Americans before the twentieth century. Today, in just one month\u2019s edition of \u201cScientific American\u201d there are stories about a realistic plan to send tiny spacecraft to the nearest star within our lifetimes, a tested method of redesigning T-cells drawn from our own bodies to be hypervigilant cancer killers, an ingenious technique to discover the true coloration of dinosaurs, new ways to test robotic systems to determine if they truly possess humanlike intelligence, and a practical experiment to determine if alleviating a mother\u2019s poverty will improve the brain of her newborn child during the first three years of life.

Science is not for you. But\u2026 If you can see the connection between scientific exploration and the quality of our lives; if you value discovery for its own sake as well as the practical benefits it confers; if you perceive how science plays a critical role in warning us of the dangers ahead and how to defuse them, then prepare to march. Why? Because ideological denial of science has metastasized from slogans to a cancer on our nation. The White House has purged scientific information, gagged government scientists, and is reversing efforts to mitigate global warming. The new head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, has fought scientific advice on curbing unnecessary (but highly profitable) medical tests. The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is an ardent opponent of environmental regulation and a denier of anthropogenic climate change. A physicist said to be the frontrunner for presidential science adviser goes a step further: William Happer declares that climate change will be great for humanity. This is like saying that lighting a torch in a fireworks factory will result in a beautiful display. It could happen, but it\u2019s much more likely that we\u2019d have a calamitous blast. Yet, for all that the attacks on science appear to come from one political party, science is not a partisan issue. It\u2019s not any kind of issue. Rather, science is a proven method for acquiring reliable knowledge about the world we inhabit and the means to make life better for all. Yes, it creates problems, too\u2014but it also offers solutions to those problems. Progress is real, and it\u2019s a wagon hitched to science. The wheels may be momentarily stuck in the mud of retrograde ideology, but that just means we have to get out and push. Maybe your shoe leather is worn thin already. Maybe you did the Women\u2019s March or you stayed home on \u201cA Day Without Immigrants.\u201d Possibly you\u2019ve taken some other stand for resistance. Your feet burn. You\u2019re feeling worn down. Hey, buck up. If we only look out for our favorite cause, none of us will succeed. As statesman, publisher, inventor, and scientist Benjamin Franklin rightly said, \u201cWe must indeed all hang together, or we shall, most assuredly, all hang separately.\u201d On April 22, let us assuredly hang together in the March for Science and on April 29 for the People\u2019s Climate March.

According to Randell S. Hansen, mission statements are designed to provide direction to an organization. It acts as an invisible hand that guides the organization and\u00a0explains the organization\u2019s reason for being. In short, it\u00a0answers the question, \u201cWhat business are we in?\u201d Whether building a business or\u00a0a personal brand you absolutely need a mission statement. As a content writer who is constantly hired to write bios and about me/us sections for websites, one of the most common things I encounter are businesses or brands without mission statements. Having a carefully crafted mission statement is one of the first things businesses/brands need to invest in, way before they begin to sell their products or services. You wouldn't build a house without first creating a blueprint of where the walls will go or where the rooms will be. You wouldn't buy furniture and decorate the house without ensuring that the roof is properly built and the floors are properly laid, so why would you start a business without laying the foundation first? I know that sometimes the excitement overwhelms us and we're eager to get started, but you have to crawl before you walk. If not, you'll end up flat on your face. When I get contracted to work with someone to create what is generally the first thing prospective customers and clients look at (bios & about me/us sections)\u00a0I ask \"What is your mission statement?\" Not surprisingly, more often than not, they don\u2019t have one. If you aren't clear on your own or your business's purpose how will you make sure that you don't sway from your core values. Mission statements serve as your compass and help keep you aligned with your purpose. Mission statements may seem overused and unimportant in the scheme of things, but having a well-crafted one ensures that you never veer too far off from the reason you started in the first place.\u00a0Below are three\u00a0reasons why you should definitely have a mission statement. KEEPS YOU FOCUSED. When you have a mission statement you in essence are defining why it is your business/brand exists. Your mission statement clearly states your purpose and it highlights the problem your business/brand seeks to solve.\u00a0 Additionally, it can give you a framework for evaluating opportunities and deciding whether they fit your core business model and strategy. DETERMINES THE BUSINESS/BRAND DIRECTION. The mission statement helps keep you and your business on the right track. It will help guide you back to your business\u2019s main purpose should you find yourself veering off your intended path. It keeps everyone clear on the direction of the organization. And as Andy Stanley says, \u201cIt\u2019s your direction, not your intention, that determines your destination.\u201d SIMPLIFIES THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.\u00a0 A clearly defined mission statement sets important boundaries which enable you to delegate both responsibility and authority when necessary. When everyone on your team is clear on the mission it makes those seemingly difficult decisions easier. When you\u2019re clear on your mission you measure your potential choices by how closely they align with your core beliefs and purpose. Mission is to the business what a compass is to an explorer or a map is to a tourist. It provides a framework for making the tough decisions and it provides the boundaries you need in order to stay on the path to your preferred future. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started writing a mission statement start by defining who you are. Identify your customer base. What services, products, or skills are you offering? How and where are you offering it? What sets you apart and makes you different? Then start working on putting that into a well thought out mission statement. Keep it short, simple, and specific. If you\u2019re still unsure about how to write your own mission statement, then Google mission statements of some of the most successful businesses and brands that you admire and respect. For example, consider this example from the world\u2019s dominant search provider: Google\u2019s mission is to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. It\u2019s short and specific, yet it remains flexible enough that the company can grow and expand beyond being just an Internet search provider. Remember, remaining flexible and open to change is what keeps the most successful companies successful.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

March!', body='It\u2019s hard to believe that 92 years after the Scopes Monkey Trial (which debated teaching evolution in public schools), the integrity of the science community is in politically charged territory. The reality of climate change, possibly the greatest concern of the 21st century, is challenged by those who refuse to accept findings which indicate that the world is warming. There is an ongoing effort to refute that human activity has been a key driver in the \u201cgreenhouse effect.\u201d For stakeholders in the fossil fuel industry, facts pointing to human-produced climate change is an impediment to their agenda. With greater fossil fuel carbon in the air, more heat is returning to earth. Arctic sea ice is decreasing, oceans are rising, extreme weather is frequent, birds and other species are changing their behavioral patterns. The new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, has maintained that the science of climate change is \u201cfar from settled.\u201d What\u2019s a scientist to do, beyond present the facts? March! Scientists and supporters of science will do just that at the March for Science on April 22, Earth Day. Science needs a higher profile in our country. Currently, studies show that America lags woefully behind in graduating science majors. Stats underscore that America ranked number 38 out of 40 countries. In 2012, President Obama set the goal of increasing STEM graduates by one million by 2022. Unfortunately, science isn\u2019t considered \u201csexy.\u201d When featured in news stories it too often doesn\u2019t get the eyeballs (except glazed). That\u2019s about to change\u200a\u2014\u200athe tagline for the march is, \u201cScience, Not Silence.\u201d The organizers state: There are several core principles featured, with the purpose of bringing key positions to the forefront: The march is also looking to place the important work of scientists within the context of daily life. They want to contribute to a vibrant dialogue of ideas without retribution. Ironically, people throughout the country are not as disconnected from the scientific facts as might be believed. A Quinnipiac Poll from February 8 found that American voters are aware of the crucial environmental issues facing the country\u200a\u2014\u200aand the world. Hundreds of thousands of science supporters have signed up to volunteer or participate in the Science March in DC and satellite marches are planned for other cities in America from Alaska to Arkansas, and globally from Paris to New Zealand. The best way for parents and their kids to ensure science will influence policy is to show up to support not only unfettered truth, but also to mobilize for the necessity of cutting-edge science education in their schools. Already, many in the education field have expressed concern about the belief system of the new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u200a\u2014\u200aon evolution and creationism. In this moment in America, families marching in resistance to President Trump\u2019s morally repugnant anti-science, anti-environmental actions is what democracy looks like to protect our health and our planet.

The researchers said they hope this new information will fuel future studies on limb regeneration and, perhaps, one day be applied to humans. For the study, researchers compared the genetic makeup of three species with known regenerative capabilities:\u00a0two fish -- zebrafish and bichir -- and axolotl salamanders, pictured above. The scientists amputated the regenerative limbs of the animals. Then, they took samples at the amputation sites and conducted RNA sequencing. The study found that the defining feature of animals with regenerative capabilities is the formation of a type of tissue called blastema, a highly proliferative tissue with the ability to form organs and appendages. The researchers noted that there are fundamental differences in tissue composition and complexity among the animals observed. Still, they found that the samples from each species shared certain microRNAs that may be involved in blastema formation. \"Our study suggests that natural cellular reprogramming of differentiated cells during regeneration is guided by a core group of shared, differentially controlled\" microRNAs, the scientists wrote. Though these three species diverged in evolution some 420 million years ago,\u00a0the scientists said they believe comparative studies like this one will be key in revealing the secrets of limb regeneration,\u00a0even for humans.

Their certainty of being bailed out because they are seen as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d harms the competitiveness of smaller, community banks and allows the big bankers to take bigger risks with \u201cother people\u2019s money,\u201d as Justice Brandeis put it. These big banks are so pervasive in their reach that even unions and progressive media, such as The Nation magazine and Democracy Now have their accounts with JP Morgan Chase. The government allows banks to have concentrated power. Taxpayers and Consumers are charged excessive fees and paid paltry interest rates on savings. The bonds of municipalities are are also hit with staggering fees and public assets like highways and public drinking water systems are corporatized by Goldman Sachs and other privatizers with sweetheart multi-decade leases. Then there are the immense taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street, such as those in 2008-2009 after the financial industry\u2019s recklessness and crimes brought down the economy, cost workers 8 million jobs, and shredded the pension and mutual fund savings of the American people. Standing like a beacon of stability, responsiveness and profitability is the 98 year-old, state-owned Bank of North Dakota (BND). As reported by Ellen Brown, prolific author and founder of the Public Banking Institute (Santa Clarita, California), \u201cThe BND has had record profits for the last 12 years\u201d (avoiding the Wall Street crash) \u201ceach year outperforming the last. In 2015 it reported $130.7 million in earnings, total assets of $7.4 billion, capital of $749 million, and a return on investment of a whopping 18.1 percent. Its lending portfolio grew by $486 million, a 12.7 percent increase, with growth in all four of its areas of concentration: agriculture, business, residential and student loans\u2026\u201d North Dakota\u2019s economy is depressed because of the sharp drop in oil prices. So the BND moved to help. Again, Ellen Brown: In 2015, it introduced new infrastructure programs to improve access to medical facilities, remodel or construct new schools, and build new road and water infrastructure. The Farm Financial Stability Loan was introduced to assist farmers affected by low commodity prices or below-average crop production. The BND also helped fund 300 new businesses. All this is in a state with half the population of Phoenix or Philadelphia. A California coalition is forming to establish a state-owned bank for California. Coalition organizers say a California State Bank will cut the state\u2019s long-term financing costs in half, compared to what avaricious Wall Street is charging. The nation\u2019s largest state (equivalent to the world\u2019s sixth largest economy) can free itself from massive debt accumulation, bid-rigging, deceptive interest-rate swaps and capital appreciation bonds at 300% interest over time. What assets does the state have to make this bank fully operational? California has surplus funds which total about $600 billion, including those in a Pooled Money Investment account managed by the State Treasurer that contains $54 billion earning less than 1 percent interest. Money in these funds is earmarked for specific expenditure purposes, but they can be invested \u2013 in a new state bank. To escape from a Wall Street that is, in Brown\u2019s words \u201csucking massive sums in interest, fees and interest rate swap payments out of California and into offshore tax havens,\u201d a state bank can use its impressive credit power to develop infrastructure in California. Huge state pension funds and other state funds can provide the deposits. Each one billion dollar capital investment can lend $10 billion for projects less expensively and under open stable banking control by California. Presently, California and other states routinely deposit hundreds of billions of dollars in Wall Street banks at minimal interest, turn around and borrow for infrastructure construction and repair from the Wall Street bond market at much higher interest and fees. This is a ridiculous form of debt peonage, a lesson Governor Jerry Brown has yet to learn. He and other officials similarly uninformed about how the state of California can be its own banker should visit publicbankinginstitute.org and read Ellen Brown\u2019s book, The Public Bank Solution. Legislation for public banks is being pursued in the states of Washington, Michigan, Arizona and New Jersey, as well as the cities of Philadelphia and Santa Fe. Look for county commissioners and state treasurers to come on board when they see the enormous safeguards and savings that can be secured through \u201cpublic banks\u201d in contrast to the convoluted casino run by unaccountable Wall Street gamblers and speculators. A longtime backer of public banking, retired entrepreneur Richard Mazess, hopes that national civic groups like Public Citizen, Common Cause, People for the American Way and Consumer Watchdog can get behind the proposal. \u201cPublic, not private, infrastructure is essential for an equitable economy,\u201d he says. California already has a public infrastructure bank called the IBank. Mr. Mazess and others believe that expanding the existing IBank into a depository institution would be more likely to pass through the California legislature. The deposits would come from public institutions, and NGOs (not from private persons). These pension funds and other public deposits would become reserves and serve as the basis for safely leveraged loans to public projects at a conservative tenfold multiplier. No derivatives or other shenanigans allowed. Before that proposal can be enacted, however, there needs to be much more education of state legislators and the public at large. Such enlightenment would illuminate the enormous savings, along with the restoration of state sovereignty from the absentee, exploitative grip of an unrepentant, speculating, profiteering Wall Street that believes it can always go to Washington, DC for its taxpayer bailouts.'}.

Rep. Keith Ellison asked the agency why, and so far he\u2019s not happy with the answer. In its latest response, FEMA says it basically forgot. \u201cThere was no decision, and no direction, to deliberately avoid or omit any particular term in the writing of the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan,\u201d\u00a0FEMA Director Brock Long wrote on April 12, referring to the document the agency uses to help anticipate and prepare the nation for natural disasters.\u00a0 Long\u2019s claim is a remarkable one given that 2017 was the\u00a0costliest, most-damaging year on record\u00a0for weather and climate-related disasters in the U.S., and the third-warmest year on record.\u00a0Experts predict those costs, which directly impact FEMA\u2019s operation, will increase as the climate shifts further and further from its baseline. The previous, Obama-era strategic plan identified climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk and urged action; the new,\u00a0Trump-era document\u00a0doesn\u2019t mention it at all. Ellison is now asking the agency to give a real explanation. On Wednesday, he asked FEMA to explain the \u201canalytical basis\u201d for why it omitted climate change from its five-year plan.\u00a0 \u201cYour April 12th, 2018, response did not adequately answer this question.\u201d Ellison wrote in a letter to Long. \u201cAlthough you reassured me that \u2018the plan emphasizes all aspects of disaster preparedness, regardless of cause,\u2019 you still have not addressed why the plan makes no mention of climate change.\u201d Where Ellison\u2019s original letter asked FEMA to identify whom it consulted in drafting its new strategic plan,\u00a0Long only cited \u201cFEMA employees and external stakeholders,\u201d\u00a0as well as comments submitted online.\u00a0Long\u2019s responses to follow-up questions only referred back to that answer, including a request that FEMA specifically identify \u201cany scientists or climate experts\u201d who contributed to the decision.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Uber's CEO Needs To Step Down', body='Can Uber really change its toxic bro culture if bro-in-chief Travis Kalanick sticks around? The answer now is clearly no. Since HuffPost first published this article on Wednesday, new revelations have emerged about the Uber chief executive that offer even more evidence that Kalanick is not a leader capable of managing a company where employees (and customers) are free from harassment and discrimination.\u00a0 Late on Thursday, Recode published an email Kalanick sent to Uber employees in 2013 advising them on how to behave at an upcoming company party.\u00a0 An excerpt speaks for itself: \u201cDo not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic \u201cYES! I will have sex with you\u201d AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command. Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML\u201d FML indeed. Is it any wonder Uber has a big problem with discrimination, harassment and bullying when the CEO so clearly feels that the workplace is a kind of profitable frat party?\u00a0 As Uber scrambles to fix the broken workplace, rife with inexperienced managers, weak human resource processes, sexual harassment and bullying, it\u2019s becoming pretty clear that Kalanick shouldn\u2019t be around at the end of the process. On Tuesday, Uber fired a stunning 20 employees \u2015 some senior executives \u2015 for a variety of offenses, including sexual harassment, bullying, bias and retaliation unearthed by an outside law firm. An additional executive was fired, Recode reported, because he had illegally obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India and showed them Kalanick, who took no action. The executive, Eric Alexander, the president of business in the Asia Pacific,\u00a0believed the customer\u2019s allegation was a hoax. An Indian court sentenced the driver to life in prison for his crime. More firings are likely.  Next week, Uber is expected to release a report on harassment and discrimination at a company-wide meeting, the result of a separate investigation led by former attorney general Eric Holder, now a partner at a big D.C. law firm.\u00a0 The company is desperately seeking to change its reputation, in the gutter since at least February, when former engineer Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing horrifying sexual harassment. Not only did Fowler\u2019s boss sexually proposition her on her first day, her complaint to human resources was blown off because her manager was considered too valuable an employee. Fowler said she heard similar stories of sexual harassment from female colleagues. Since then, Uber has taken steps to improve its human resources department and its image, and a stream of top executives have fled. \u201cCulture changes have been well underway at the company for months now,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman told HuffPost. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re more committed than ever to turning the page. We want to change.\u201d Just this week, Uber hired Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei, a management consultant and expert in company culture best known for her efforts to change how Harvard\u2019s B-school treats women. Uber also hired a brand consultant from Apple, also a woman, to help improve its image. Thing is, you don\u2019t need fancy consultants to tell you this simple truth about company culture: It starts at the top. The boss sets the example, the tone and the norms for the entire company. (This applies to government, as well. Just ask any White House staffer trying to work under President Donald Trump.) Uber is just now fixing a computer algorithm to determine how much to pay new hires. The old system reinforced gender pay gaps, allowing women to be paid less than men.\u00a0 Kalanick\u2019s vibe is well known at this point: He works obsessively hard, and expects everyone at Uber to do the same. The result is a company worth billions, and a brutal, hard-driving culture with incredibly high turnover. Apple CEO and founder Steve Jobs also had a reputation for driving workers hard, and saying things bluntly. That\u2019s not unusual for a startup founder. At Uber, problems have come when Kalanick has opened his mouth and said incredibly arrogant and misogynistic things. \u201cDo I trigger something in certain people that\u2019s related to something that I didn\u2019t do? Or am I an asshole? I\u2019d love to know,\u201d Kalanick told Fortune magazine\u2019s\u00a0Adam Lashinsky. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not.\u201d (Kalanick has been keeping a low profile since the recent sudden death of his mother. They were reportedly very close.) Kalanick has amassed quite a track record for inappropriate comments: In an interview with GQ in 2014, he bragged about how his newfound fame as a tech CEO was attracting women. \u201cYeah, we call that Boob-er,\u201d he said. A recent story in tech publication The Information described Kalanick\u2019s visit to a South Korean karaoke and escort bar with executives, mostly men and at least one woman, who reported being extremely uncomfortable. His former girlfriend told HuffPost recently that when she was with him, they\u2019d frequently attend parties, where most of the women were models flown in to serve as, essentially, decor. After a video of Kalanick fighting with an Uber driver went viral earlier this year, he finally admitted his behavior was a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this video is a reflection of me\u00a0\u2015 and the criticism we\u2019ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\u201d Kalanick wrote in a blog post titled \u201cA profound apology.\u201d Who decided it was profound? \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it,\u201d he wrote. He\u2019s begun meditating, according to Uber board member and HuffPost founder Arianna Huffington. Kalanick, it is worth emphasizing, is not a 20-something prodigy running a tech company. He is a relatively experienced executive who has been running Uber since 2010. He is 40 years old. This was an adult male admitting he\u2019d behaved like a child. He hasn\u2019t yet proven whether he has the chops to actually grapple with his behavior. Companies that have managed big culture shifts usually do it with new leaders. Microsoft, for example, seems to have really changed its way since hiring Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer, known for fueling a toxic, competitive culture. Kalanick has admitted he needs leadership help, and this week\u2019s hires are part of the change, it seems.\u00a0But it\u2019s not at all clear that this is enough. Indeed, the company\u2019s HR chief, Liane Hornsey, who is close to Kalanick, seemed to downplay the idea that sexual harassment is even a problem at Uber just last month in an interview with USA Today. She said pay and \u201cpride\u201d are more at issue. Fowler\u2019s \u201cblog shocked me,\u201d Hornsey said. \u201cBut, what did surprise me, was when I did the listening sessions, this didn\u2019t come up as an issue. It wasn\u2019t one of our big themes. Other things came up that are in that area, that our values are masculine and a little aggressive, but the harassment issue, I just didn\u2019t find that at all.\u201d But it seems Hornsey was downplaying the situation. Of the 215 claims investigated by Perkins Coie, the law firm whose report led to this week\u2019s firings, 47 involved sexual harassment, Uber\u2019s only female board member told CNBC on Wednesday. Leaders aren\u2019t solely responsible for the way a company operates.\u00a0\u201cLeaders set an example,\u201d Joseph Badaracco, a professor at Harvard Business School, told HuffPost recently. Still, he said,\u00a0companies need to have systems in place that reinforce employee behavior. Workers need to have strong managers, understand the rules of the workplace, and know that misbehavior will not be tolerated.\u00a0 A fast-growing startup inevitably has a lot of problems as it expands. A majority of Uber\u2019s managers are in a supervisory role for the first time, creating all kinds of complications.\u00a0Uber also hired very quickly \u2015 a notoriously way to build a company culture \u2015 and basically had been using its human resources department as a recruiting arm, not a place to help employees with issues. But for all the layers of ingredients that brought Uber to where it is, it would seem that problems came baked in with one of its very first workers. The headline and opening paragraphs of this article have been updated to account for the disclosure of Kalanick\u2019s 2013 memo to employees.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='A Debate On The Pros And Cons Of Aging And Death', body='At age 74, I have already experienced many of the indignities of aging and before very long will also confront the inevitability of death. Although neither prospect\u00a0is particularly pleasant, I strongly believe in the normality and necessity of both. Claims that science will soon prevent aging and dramatically prolong life strike me as irresponsible hype and false hope. I am all for efforts to expand our healthspan, but see little value in prolonging our lifespan, and little possibility that we will soon discover a fountain of youth.\u00a0 My\u00a0grandson, home from college for Christmas break, disagrees with what he regards as my\u00a0sentimental and regressive attachment to the status quo. Tyler is participating in stem cell and genetics research and believes that it is feasible and desirable to double the human lifespan and\u00a0make aging just another curable disease. Tyler has no qualms about this research and regards my doubts as technically naive and ethically unnecessary.\u00a0 Here is a very brief point by point summary of our ongoing debate. Me: Evolution requires aging and death to make room for each new generation and also favors a fairly rapid succession of generations. Both are necessary to provide raw material for the variability and beneficial mutations essential to natural selection. \u00a0 Tyler:\u00a0Evolution has little interest in aging and death. Natural selection focuses its selective pressure on producing optimal reproductive fitness in the mating members of any species. Once the period of reproduction and weaning have passed, natural selection applies much less\u00a0pressure on how the rest of the lifespan plays out. There is thus no inherent evolutionary reason to prohibit research that would prevent aging and prolong life. And there are excellent reasons to pursue it- although\u00a0evolution does a remarkable job when given enough time, it works far too slowly and imperfectly to help us solve our current problems. Whenever, in the past, it has served our interests, humans have always felt free to speed up natural selection. We would still be hunters and gatherers were it not for the\u00a0artificial selection of domesticated plants and animals that constituted\u00a0the\u00a0agricultural and pastoral revolutions.\u00a0If we have the genetic tools to promote human health, longevity, and happiness, why not use them. Me: But the world is already terribly over-populated and is rapidly becoming even more over-populated. Extending the lifespan will mean more crowding, more mouths to feed, more environmental degradation, and more resource depletion. Malthusian dynamics ensure that providing a longer life for some must be purchased at the high cost of a more brutal life for the many- a life threatened by even more wars, migrations, famines, and epidemics. Tyler:\u00a0Overpopulation is best solved by reducing birthrates. This has already been done with great success almost everywhere in the world except Africa and the Middle East. It will be a better, more mature, and healthier world if people live longer and have fewer diseases and fewer children. A longer lifespan will make people wiser, more future oriented, and less willing to take foolish risks in the present. This could lead to more rational decisions on how best to preserve our planet as a decent place to live.\u00a0 Me: Only the rich will be able to afford new\u00a0products that prevent\u00a0aging and promote longevity. The resulting caste system based on lifespan will be even more unfair than our current divisions based on wealth and power.\u00a0 Tyler: The distribution of benefits that will accrue from aging research\u00a0is a political, economic, and ethical question, not a scientific one. Given human nature and existing institutional structures, the benefits will almost certainly be enjoyed in a markedly unequal and unfair fashion- greatly favoring the rich and powerful, with only a very slow trickle down to the population at large. This inequity has accompanied every previous technological advance in the long march of human progress and is not specifically disqualifying to progress in slowing aging and death. Me: Every scientific advance can, and usually does, have harmful, unintended consequences (medical, social, political, economic) that cannot possibly be predicted in advance. Scientists always have intellectual and financial conflicts of interest that bias them to exaggerate the potential benefits to be derived from their discoveries and to minimize the potential risks. Tyler: Surely,\u00a0aging research\u00a0will have its hype, blind alleys, and unexpected complications- these are an unavoidable risk in\u00a0all scientific advances. But the risks and difficulties\u00a0should not paralyze efforts to make the advance or call into question whether it should be made; instead, they should increase caution and vigilance in how it is done. And we must remember the context. Our world is already going to hell in a handbasket- the risks of advancing science are real, but the potential benefits may be all that stand between us and disaster. Science is necessarily disruptive, but may offer our only road to salvation. To quote\u00a0Mark Watney in the movie 'The Martian': \"In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.\" Me: There is something arrogant and unseemly about tampering with anything so fundamental to life as aging and death. Their inevitability has always been an essential element governing the ebb and flow of all the species and all the individual organisms that have ever lived on our planet. Why assume that we have the right, or the need, to tamper with such a basic aspect of nature? Tyler: Scientific progress has always challenged conservative values based on a sentimental attachment to the past. My grandfather would probably have worked hard to convince the first agriculturalists that they were breaking some sacred and natural code when they chose to settle down in one place rather than continue following the hunt. There is no inevitable, inexorable, over-riding, and natural law defining and governing one correct path of human destiny.\u00a0 Me: Curing disease is the primary goal of medical science. But aging is not a disease- it is an entirely expectable wearing down, an expression of biological entropy that cannot be reversed. We should certainly target the diseases that occur in old age in an effort to extend the average human healthspan. Success will improve the well being of the elderly and have a small subsidiary effect on lifespan- eg, more people living into their 80's, 90's, and 100's. But we should not expect that better treatment for diseases will allow people to live to biblical ages. Despite the hype to the contrary, there is no reason to believe it is\u00a0scientifically feasible or\u00a0ethically desirable for people to stay young for 150 years. The most compelling lesson of scientific research is that the body is far more complicated and intricately balanced than we could possibly imagine. We are still at a very early stage in curing disease- there is no reason to think we can prevent decline or postpone death. Tyler: It is far too early to tell whether aging in humans is more a reversible disease or an inescapable degenerative process. But since aging is caused by biochemical processes, it most likely can be prolonged by\u00a0biochemical interventions.\u00a0We can't decide the question based on values and reasoning- only by actually doing the aging research will we learn whether aging is preventable. And sure it may take many decades, but that's precisely why we have to allocate the resources now to get the project off to a fast start. \u00a0 Me: Unrealistic promises result in false incentives and misallocated resources. Typical example: we are investing a vast fortune on the wildly unrealistic goal of eliminating dementia within a decade or two, while taking dreadful care of the people who are already actually demented. Less hype would result in better balance between our hopes for the future and fulfilling our responsibilities in the present. Tyler: Aging is already a\u00a0pressing current issue and will soon become the biggest medical problem of our future. There is no running away or putting our head in the sand.\u00a0My goal is to make life longer and better for people.\u00a0Sure, there are\u00a0some aging researchers who are overly\u00a0enthusiastic in promoting their research and in promising quick results. And we mustn't neglect the many practical problems of people who are aging today on the false hope that science will quickly and magically come to their rescue. We must find a proper balance between research investments that will pay off only in the distant future and current health care investments for those who are in need today. The future of our species depends on how we handle our demographics. The way ahead is difficult and uncertain- but that has never stopped us before. We make lots of mistakes along the way, but science helps us correct them. There is no standing pat- if we don't move forward, we will move backward. My Reflections On The Debate There is a disturbing myth from ancient Greece. Aurora, the immortal goddess of the dawn, falls so deeply in love with a mortal man that she cannot accept losing him to death. She pleads successfully with the Olympian gods to grant him immortality, but forgets to request that he\u00a0also\u00a0be gifted with perpetual youth. Her human lover Is thus punished with the worst of fates- interminable life, daily made more intolerable by progressive aging and deterioration. Jonathan Swift illustrated the same chilling issue in Gulliver's Travels and also tragically in his own long, tortured, and undignified death from dementia.\u00a0 Modern medicine has\u00a0cursed an increasing percentage of our aging population to suffer this\u00a0miserable fate- an artificially prolonged life preventing a natural and peaceful death. Medicine is, so far, much more advanced in keeping elderly people alive than in keeping them well. Our goal should be enhanced health, not a longer existence if that existence is painful and has lost all meaning. Medicine should help people live well, but also let them die peacefully and with dignity.\u00a0 Tyler is much more optimistic than I that we will soon have the technical means to prolong youth and postpone death- and that we should use them. I am more accepting of the limits of life- eager to improve its quality, rather than expecting to extend its duration. Tyler trusts scientists to make scientific decisions. I believe that scientists have conflicts of interest that make them uniquely unqualified to judge the ethical implications of the scientific opportunities open to them. If scientists can do something, they will do it- fairly heedless of unintended consequences. Tyler has the optimism and enthusiasm of the young. I have the pessimism and caution of the old.\u00a0 In a final flourish, Tyler trumped my argument that aging and death are somehow natural to the\u00a0evolutionary\u00a0scheme of things with the paradox that evolution has also given us the power to control aging and death and that surely we are programed to use it. He is probably right. I don't think our debate will be settled on ethical or theoretical\u00a0grounds. History provides precious few examples of a society voluntarily rejecting the application of a powerful new technology- e.g., China burning its navy in the fifteenth century; Japan banning guns in the seventeenth. But both were closed societies whose conservative decisions were governed by internal political concerns; they were much less responsive than ours to economic and scientific competition and pressure.\u00a0 My guess is that scientists will be given the freedom and the funding to follow every possible path to the fountain of youth and to doubling the lifespan. If they succeed, some chosen few of humanity will enjoy great benefits, while the masses may suffer even more than they do today and our environment may decay even faster than it already has.\u00a0But I find aesthetic comfort in the firm belief that the scientists won't be able to deliver on their extravagant promises. Although our knowledge base is increasing exponentially, the more we learn about the body, the more we appreciate how difficult it is to translate basic science into clinical application. Our bodies are remarkably complex and carefully balanced machines. Scientists can tinker with them, but I suspect that the basic cycle of life and death will be very hard to change.

The company's shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago. Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded. The company plans to create a new class of non-voting shares, which would be given as a dividend to existing shareholders. That would allow Zuckerberg, who wants to give away 99 percent of his wealth, to sell non-voting stock to fund philanthropy and keep the voting stock that assures his control. Alphabet Inc. passed a similar proposal in 2014 that ensured its founders' control by creating new non-voting shares. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users. Advertisers are shifting money from television to web and mobile platforms, and Facebook is one of the biggest beneficiaries. It faces fierce competition in the mobile video market, where rivals Snapchat and YouTube also garner billions of video views every day. Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out several new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The quarterly results showed success attracting advertisers with the move, and the company was able to expand its operating profit margin to 55 percent from 52 percent a year earlier. \"The company consistently 'warns' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They're an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise. Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue. The results come after disappointments for investors from several major Silicon Valley firms. \"After Intel and IBM last week, and then Twitter and Apple yesterday, this is by far the best number I\u2019ve seen in technology,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company which owns about $40 million worth of Facebook shares, commenting specifically about Facebook ad revenue. Facebook has not begun advertising on some of its most popular apps. \"They haven't yet turned on the monetization spigot for Messenger or WhatsApp, so there should be significant headroom still,\" said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street's 62-cent consensus. Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $5.26 billion. If the stock proposal is approved - and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock - the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split, issuing two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced last year that they would give away 99 percent of their Facebook shares to fund charitable endeavors. Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increasing control, pointing to the company's consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations. \"I honestly don't think anyone cares if he has more power, since he's done everything right since they went public,\" said Pachter.

There is no shortage of commentary on the matter, with recent discussions focusing on the legality of the incident and United\u2019s public response. Some are saying that in spite of how disturbing the incident was \u2013 United acted within its legal rights. This is absolutely false. United Airlines acted negligently and inappropriately in removing the passenger from the plane, and then compounded the problem in its public response to the incident. United Airlines has policies and procedures in place called its \u201cContract of Carriage,\u201d which permits the airline to refuse service to passengers under certain clearly defined circumstances. For example, United\u2019s \u201cRefusal of Transport\u201d rule lists the various conditions where they can remove a passenger who has already boarded an airplane. Some of these conditions include if a passenger appears to be intoxicated, a passenger\u2019s conduct is abusive or violent, or if a passenger is carrying a weapon. Yet, nowhere does it mention an airplane being \u201coverbooked\u201d as permissible grounds for the airline to forcibly remove a passenger from his or her seat against their will.  The plane being \u201coverbooked\u201d was merely United\u2019s pretext for physically removing Dr. David Dao. However, the plane was not actually \u201coverbooked,\u201d as United later admitted. Rather, the airline wanted to use four seats to fly staff members to Louisville for a flight the next day. United should have taken far more reasonable measures to transport its staff to Louisville, such as offering more money to entice passengers to agree to take another flight. In fact, even though the Department of Transportation permitted United to offer passengers up to $1,350 in cash, they only offered $800 before physically throwing Mr. Dao off the plane. If no passengers were willing to reschedule their flights for money, United should have chartered a small plane to fly its staff members from Chicago to Louisville. All of these options would have been far better than assaulting a paying customer, injuring and embarrassing him in the process.  Sadly, United was far more concerned with saving money.  To add insult to injury, United initially failed to accept responsibility for the incident. At first, United\u2019s CEO Oscar Munoz characterized what happened as a \u201cre-accommodation.\u201d He then sent a letter to employees describing Dr. Dao as \u201cdisruptive and belligerent,\u201d and said that the United \u201cemployees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this.\u201d Fewer than thirty-six hours later, and only after United\u2019s stock price plummeted and its customers expressed public outrage, did he change his tune. Finally, he came out and stated that the company would take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and formally apologized to Dr. Dao. This is exactly what United should have done from the outset. Before rushing to publicly criticize a paying customer, Mr. Munoz should have put himself, or one of his family members, in Dr. Dao\u2019s shoes and thought about how morally reprehensible and inexcusable the entire incident was. Mr. Munoz might have a M.B.A., but he needs a degree in common sense.   While United Airlines\u2019 response to this incident may surprise some people, I was unfortunately not surprised. Far too often, large companies respond to negligent or inappropriate actions by only attempting to protect themselves and evade responsibility. Companies even try to blame the victim, as United did here in describing Dr. Dao\u2019s behavior as \u201cdisruptive and belligerent.\u201d Salacious news about Dr. Dao\u2019s personal history also surfaced as a result of United\u2019s response. But Dr. Dao\u2019s personal history is a red herring and completely misses the point; no rule abiding, paying customer, regardless of their personal circumstances, should be forcibly removed from a plane.  Unfortunately, it often takes tragic events like the one here to spur change. I\u2019ve represented victims for my entire career in all types of avoidable accidents and learned first-hand that companies regularly fail to take proactive steps to prevent tragedy. Hopefully United Airlines will learn from this massive and inexcusable blunder and never allow anything like this to happen again. Nevertheless, Dr. Dao has grounds for a strong civil lawsuit against United for the various injuries they have caused him.      '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The sexual misconduct allegations against the ex-players were detailed in an amended lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday by Jami Cantor, a former wardrobe stylist at the NFL Network In the complaint, first reported by Bloomberg News, Cantor accused Faulk of fondling her breasts and exposing his penis as he demanded oral sex. She said that Evans, a former fullback, sent nude pictures and made unwelcome propositions, and that Taylor, an ex-defensive back, sent her a video of him masturbating in the shower. \u201cThe supervisors knew about it, the supervisors observed it,\u201d Cantor\u2019s lawyer, Laura Horton, said, according to The New York Times. \u201cIt was insidious in this particular environment.\u201d She alleged another man, former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger, groped her and pushed his genitals against her.

The investment comes as Apple is trying to reinvigorate sales in China, its second-largest market. Apple recently has come under pressure from Chinese regulators, with its online book and film services shut down last month, and Cook is traveling to the country this month. The investment gives Apple, which has hired dozens of automotive experts over the past year, a sizeable stake in Uber Technologies Inc's chief rival in China. Cook said in an interview that he sees opportunities for Apple and Didi Chuxing to collaborate in the future. \"We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market,\" he said. \"Of course, we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital over time as well.\" Didi Chuxing, formerly known as Didi Kuaidi, said in a statement that the funding from Apple was the single largest investment it has ever received. The company, which previously raised several billion dollars, dominates the ride-sharing market in China. The company said it completes more than 11 million rides a day, with more than 87 percent of the market for private car-hailing in China. Investors are eagerly watching to see whether Apple will enter the automotive business. Apple has hired a wide range of automotive experts, and the company is exploring building a self-driving car, sources have told Reuters. Cook said Apple remains focused on the in-car experience with its CarPlay system that links smartphones to vehicle infotainment systems. \u201cThat is what we do today in the car business, so we will have to see what the future holds,\" he said. Although Apple's sales in China have slumped amid slowing economic growth there, Cook stressed he remains confident in the market. The deal \"reflects our excitement about their growing business ... and also our continued confidence in the long term in China\u2019s economy,\" Cook said.

A federal judge ruled against Uber\u2019s request Thursday night and referred the Google spinoff\u2019s claims to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for investigation into the possible theft of trade secrets. That leaves the door open for possible criminal charges, depending on the investigation\u2019s outcome. \u201cThe Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney,\u201d U.S. District Judge William Alsup cautioned in his order. Waymo accuses Uber of orchestrating and paying a former Waymo executive to steal valuable self-driving technology on its behalf, an accusation Uber staunchly denies. \u201cThis was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d a Waymo spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement. \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct.\u201d In a separate order late Thursday, Alsup also made a ruling on whether or not Uber could continue working on its self-driving car program as the case moves forward. Alsup\u2019s decision on the so-called preliminary injunction was released under seal, however, as it contains confidential information, meaning the scope of its impact is unknown at this time. In a statement to HuffPost, Uber said it was disappointed in the ruling, but insisted it is innocent. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum.\u201d At the center of the case is Uber Vice President Anthony Levandowski, who was formerly a Waymo engineer. Waymo has strong evidence that Levandowski downloaded some 14,000 of its confidential files before abruptly leaving the company in January 2016. The files included valuable schematics for a Waymo circuit board that controls an important piece of self-driving technology known as lidar. Without lidar, both Uber\u2019s and Waymo\u2019s self-driving cars would be unable to \u201csee\u201d their surroundings and navigate appropriately. Almost immediately after Levandowski left Waymo, he started a rival company, Otto, which Uber acquired for $680 million just six months later. Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven argued in court this month that Otto was little more than a shell company for Levandowski to sell trade secrets to Uber, including lidar tech. Verhoeven said emails between Levandowski and Uber while the engineer was still at Waymo prove this point. \u201cThere was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,\u201d Verhoeven said. Despite compelling evidence of Levandowski\u2019s misdeeds, however, Judge Alsup initially thought Waymo lacked a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that proved Levandowski stole files at Uber\u2019s direction. That matters because Waymo\u2019s case is against Uber, not Levandowski. Waymo also struggled to prove Uber made use of its documents, despite having stumbled across a lidar circuit design\u00a0Waymo says is suspiciously similar to its own. Uber\u00a0said it searched its servers extensively and found no record of the files. It\u2019s possible Levandowski brought the information to work on his personal laptop, but that\u2019s hard to prove. \u201cWe are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,\u201d Gonzalez told the judge. Complicating matters,\u00a0Levandowski asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to testify \u2015 a tactic Uber denounced, yet that also gave it a reason not to turn over additional, potentially incriminating documents. In his ruling Thursday night, Alsup let his disdain for the tactic be known, accusing Levandowski of obstructing the efforts of both companies. \u201cEven though he is not a defendant here,\u201d he wrote, \u201cLevandowski\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants\u2019 ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo\u2019s purloined files.\u201d'}.

The delicately feathered 1.4-inch tail with bone and tissue intact was frozen in time in a piece of amber originally discovered in a mine in northern Myanmar. It was eventually found last year at a street market by paleontologist Lida Xing of Beijing\u2019s University of Geosciences.\u00a0 \u201cI never expected we could find a dinosaur in amber. This may be the coolest find in my life,\u201d Xing told NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime find,\u201d his research partner Ryan McKellar of Canada\u2019s Royal Saskatchewan Museum told CNN. \u201cThe finest details are visible and in three dimensions.\u201d They\u2019re believed to be the first-ever non-avian dinosaur feathers found preserved in amber, which are providing a fascinating glimpse into the early evolution of feathers and flight. The feathers, brown on top with white undersides, cover eight vertebrae in the specimen dating to the mid-Cretaceous period. Because the bones are articulated,\u00a0and not fused together as in modern birds,\u00a0the creature was a dinosaur and\u00a0not a prehistoric bird capable of flight, according to the scientists, who reported their findings in Current Biology. The weak structure of the crude, early feathers that lack the interlocking architecture of ones developed up the evolutionary ladder was also not conducive to flight, according to the researchers. The feathers are missing a strong central shaft, known known as a rachis. Instead of providing the capability of flight, the feathers, which likely covered the entire dinosaur, may have provided temperature regulation or some kind of signal, McKellar speculated to the National Geographic. Scientists believe the tail belonged to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of the family of theropod dinosaurs related to Tyrannosaurus rex as well as others that developed into modern birds.\u00a0Researchers have nicknamed the specimen Eva.\u00a0 Intriguingly, tissue around the bones still held had traces of ferrous iron, the remains of hemoglobin from Eva\u2019s blood. Eva was likely the size of a sparrow at death, but would have\u00a0grown to the size of an ostrich had she lived. Eva adds a key new piece to the feather puzzle. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular little glimpse,\u201d McKellar told NPR. \u201cIt gives us, basically, a pathway that gets us to modern feathers.\u201d\u00a0'}.

What sort of toxic contraption might they dream up? That would be Bitcoin. Remind me, what is the problem for which Bitcoin is a supposed solution? More on that in a moment. For the time being, the immediate Bitcoin problem is that speculators in the virtual currency have been on a wild ride, with the price of a Bitcoin rising from under $1,000 to as high as over $18,000 and back down to $12,000 before setting for the moment around $14,000. This makes a few early bettors very rich, but exactly what real economic good does that do? Okay, in case you missed it, here\u2019s the pitch. Paying with checks, credit cards or bank transfers leaves a trail. But there is no trail with Bitcoin. In a world of drug traffickers, terrorists and Kremlin weaponizing of all things cyber, this is supposed to be a plus. Say what? Conventional forms of money other than cash have transaction costs. Your checkbook, your credit cards, not to mention digital forms of money transfer such as the PayPal and Venmo, nick you for fees. But there is no fee with Bitcoin. (Actually, if you manage your money carefully you can reduce credit card and checking account fees to next to nothing.) Thanks to its ingenious, tamper-proof \u201cblockchain\u201d cryptotechnology (don\u2019t ask), Bitcoin is absolutely safe. If you believe that, I have a Russian bridge for you to buy. And unlike nasty governments, which do things like managing the money supply or preventing de-stabilizing speculation, Bitcoin is independent of any government. This is also billed as a plus. In case you missed it, check out the era of 19th century \u201cfree banking\u201d in the U.S. It was a time when tiny banks could create infinite amounts of credit. The result was an era of euphoric credit booms followed by bank panics and depressions. Ah, but the number of Bitcoins in circulation is strictly limited to $21 million. That was the claim, anyway. Well, there are now hundreds of other digital currencies, and thanks to the miracle of leverage and speculation in Bitcoins, the true sum is far higher. Exactly how much higher? We don\u2019t really know. Now in fairness, central banks and bank regulators did a pretty good job of managing the money supply for half a century after the Great Depression, and then they messed up big time. In the 1980s, regulators started getting captured by fin-tech wizards\u2014people not unlike Bitcoin enthusiasts\u2014who started inventing new forms of infinite leverage. It took about 20 years for this brew to become truly toxic. The result was the collapse of 2008. We have a lot of work to do in order to return the business of financial regulation and good monetary policy to democratic control. But if you think that task can be entrusted to an algorithm, consider this. It\u2019s an old idea\u2014economists Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek advocated putting the money supply on auto-pilot. But if that policy had been in effect when the financial collapse of 2008 occurred, and the economy had been left to the tender mercies of the invisible hand (much less the invisible cyber-hand), all of the banks would have gone bust and the economy, instead of experiencing the Great Recession, would have been in total collapse. Ben Bernanke, a Friedman enthusiast who was chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time, acknowledged that a hands-off policy was the opposite of what was needed. So the next time the wizards of speculation produce yet another financial collapse, who ya gonna call? Bitcoin? Sorry, there\u2019s nobody home. I realize I\u2019m in awkward company, here. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon (who helped bring us the financial collapse, doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin. The big banks don\u2019t like the competition, right?\u00a0 \u201cNo government will ever support a virtual currency that goes around borders and doesn\u2019t have the same controls,\u201d said Dimon.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Dimon is right that the world\u2019s central bankers should shut down virtual currencies, as both an invitation to money laundering and as a threat to monetary stability. Some central banks, such as the bank of Japan, are planning to create official digital currencies for cheap or free transactions, but in a context of regulated monetary policy. Europe has long had a less whiz-bang version of this, known as giro transfers, in which people instruct their banks to make payments on their behalf to vendors\u2019 banks, rather than writing checks And if the issue is more competition, the remedy is to break up the big banks, not to return to a digitized version of 19th century boom and bust credit creation. I may agree with Dimon on Bitcoin \u2013 I agreed with Steve Bannon on not going to nuclear war with North Korea \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I support either Bannon\u2019s racism or Dimon\u2019s predatory banking. In sum, we should hardly be surprised that Bitcoin is on a wild speculative ride\u2014that\u2019s the essence of privatized credit creation. And if you think this gambling is zero-sum and victimless, kindly Google these: Panic of 1837, Panic of 1857, Panic of 1873, Panic of 1893, Panic of 1907 and, of course, the Great Depression of 1929-1940 and the Collapse of 2008.

Sanctuary status would still allow fishing and diving, but it would forbid disturbing the forest itself.\n\nBen Raines, executive director of the Weeks Bay Foundation, has been a leading advocate for saving the forest since he first saw it in 2012. After successfully pushing the council to support his efforts, he says he's optimistic NOAA will agree the forest warrants protection.\n\n\"This is a great step toward protecting the forest,\" Raines tells the Mobile Press-Register. \"With the approval of the Gulf Council, we can move ahead toward a final designation from NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries program. ... The underwater forest really fits in with what the program tries to protect. We've had preliminary conversations with NOAA about the forest, and I believe the forest will meet the criteria for the sanctuary designation.\"\n\nThe forest has been there for at least 50,000 years, hailing from an era with much lower sea levels. It was buried in seabed mud until 2005, when Hurricane Katrina dredged up its sprawling time capsule of cypress trees. This exposed new habitat for marine life, which eventually led fishermen and divers to the forest. The location remained secret for years, fueled by fears people might damage the trees or harvest their wood. Ocean sediments have preserved the cypress so well it reportedly still smells like fresh sap when cut.\n\n\"There is nothing else like it in the Gulf, and diving there really feels like you are exploring a lost world. To know these trees, covered in anemones and crabs, were growing on dry land tens of thousands of years ago, it sort of gives you chills,\" Raines tells the Press-Register, noting the area now teems with sharks, rays, red snapper and Kemp's ridley sea turtles. \"We don't have large coral reefs around here like you see in the Florida Keys or the Caribbean, but those places don't have ancient trees popping up out of the bottom.\"'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='The Facebook Apology Tour Continues', body='Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know he\u2019s super sorry. And for the most part it really does seem like he means it \u2015 so long as apologizing and trying to earn back users\u2019 trust doesn\u2019t cut into company profits. On Wednesday afternoon, the social media company made its founder available for questions from the media shortly after it announced plans to restrict\u00a0who can access user data and to clarify how it uses that data in the first place. At the same time, Facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm Cambridge Analytica, from 50 million to as many as 87 million. Needless to say, there was plenty to talk about. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the bigger points of the conversation: Zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow. \u201cThere is going to be more content that we\u2019re going to find over time,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as there are people employed in Russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems, this is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security; it\u2019s an arms race.\u201d He acknowledged Facebook was \u201cbehind\u201d during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20,000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts. There hasn\u2019t been any \u201cmeaningful impact\u201d by the movement, he said, but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment that\u2019s driving it. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t measure a change, it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust.\u201d\u00a0 Facebook took Cambridge Analytica at its word that the company had, in fact, deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users \u2015 and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of legal action against Cambridge Analytica but said Facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when. That said, he acknowledged Facebook can\u2019t just pass the blame onto Cambridge Analytica, as Facebook\u2019s tools enabled its behavior in the first place. \u201cI think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building tools, but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.\u00a0 \u201cKnowing what I know today, clearly we should\u2019ve done more, and we will going forward.\u201d He\u2019s into it, with some reservations. Asked specifically if he\u2019d be willing to implement new privacy policies in the U.S. similar to the\u00a0strict new privacy laws rolling out in the European Union, Zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format. When the EU law takes effect on May 25, Facebook will have to get users\u2019 explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data. Zuckerberg said Facebook \u201cintends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.\u201d That\u2019s subject to some flexibility, however \u2015 a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter. Two reporters asked variations of this question, and it seemingly caught him off guard the first time. The second time he unhesitatingly said yes, portraying the company\u2019s recent stumbles more as learning opportunities than far-reaching mistakes. \u201cWhen you\u2019re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up. And if we\u2019d gotten this right, we would\u2019ve messed something else up. I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be perfect. But I think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is.\u201d Nope. Zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question, portraying a more profitable Facebook as one that\u2019s fundamentally more useful to people. As the site gets better at targeting users with more-relevant ads, the more profitable it will be. \u201cPeople tell us that if they\u2019re going to see ads, they want the ads to be good. Like most of the hard decisions we have to make, this is one where there\u2019s a trade-off between values that people care about.\u00a0On the one hand, people want relevant experiences, and on the other hand, I do think there\u2019s some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads. But I think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience.\u201d Zuckerberg broke this into three distinct categories, each to be combated via different initiatives by the company. The first category of bad actors he summed up as spammers who craft sensationalistic fake stories.\u00a0People click, the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author \u2015 often located in Macedonia \u2015 makes money. Simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content. The second category belongs to Russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election. Zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat \u2015 especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion. Facebook is making progress here, with moderate successes in the French and German elections, but Zuckerberg cautioned it will be a \u201cmulti-year effort.\u201d And the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself. That shows up on Facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that \u201cisn\u2019t really true even if the specific facts might be.\u201d Zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting\u00a0\u201cbroadly trusted journalism\u201d that does a \u201cfair and thorough\u201d job.'}.

Joshua Adam Schulte was arrested in August on federal child pornography charges, but it wasn\u2019t until Tuesday that\u00a0The Washington Post and The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0reported the government was interested in Schulte because it suspected him of providing WikiLeaks with thousands of documents on the CIA\u2019s hacking operations. The \u201cVault 7 leak,\u201d published in March 2017, was the largest loss of classified documents in CIA history. Schulte\u2019s Manhattan apartment was searched one week after it was published. The government still hasn\u2019t brought a case against Schulte in connection with WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of the documents. Instead, they charged Schulte in August with child pornography over videos found on an encrypted computer server he started back in 2009 when he was in college. His lawyers have said that dozens of people had access to that server. The FBI also sent along photos they obtained from one of Schulte\u2019s phones to prosecutors in Loudoun County, where he lived when he worked for the CIA. The photos, taken in April 2015, show a woman \u201cpassed out on the floor\u201d of his bathroom and being sexually assaulted. The unnamed woman has been referred to as Schulte\u2019s friend and former roommate. The government said in October that the county conducted its own investigation and interviewed the victim after the FBI provided the photographs. In November, according to federal prosecutors, Schulte was charged with two crimes: a felony count of object sexual penetration and a misdemeanor count of unlawful creation of an image of another. \u201cThe victim remembers the night in question. It was one of the few nights that she passed out and didn\u2019t remember what occurred. She could also, apparently, identify the bathroom, which was the bathroom where she was staying as a roommate of Mr. Schulte\u2019s,\u201d a federal prosecutor said at a hearing in January. The government told the judge that the woman was unconscious at the time, and was unable to identify Schulte as assaulting her. But prosecutors in Virginia, the federal government told the court, were evidently able to confirm that the pair of hands depicted assaulting the woman belonged to Schulte. But even if it wasn\u2019t Schulte who assaulted the victim, the federal prosecutor said it was \u201coutrageous that Mr. Schulte would keep these types of images of someone who is supposed to be his friend on his phone\u201d and contended it \u201cshows more than just someone who wants to look at things; it shows someone who cannot control their impulses.\u201d Schulte had been released on strict bail conditions in September but was detained in December after he was charged in Virginia as a result of the information the FBI had given to local prosecutors. Prosecutors also said he\u2019d violated his release conditions by accessing his email as well as the anonymous internet network TOR. The new charge, they said, \u201cshows that the defendant is someone who will act out on his impulses and actually engage in sexually dangerous behavior.\u201d Neither Schulte\u2019s attorney nor the Loudoun County prosecutor responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on those charges. The status of the Virginia case isn\u2019t entirely clear. \u201cVirginia never came to get him,\u201d his lawyer said at the hearing in January. \u201cVirginia just didn\u2019t do anything in this case.\u201d His lawyer said Virginia was \u201cjust sitting back and waiting to see what happens\u201d with the case and that the state had \u201cno interest in Mr. Schulte.\u201d The only case against Schulte listed in Loudoun County court records available online is an old traffic offense. Schulte was recently assigned a federal public defender after his private attorney dropped out. The Times reported that Schulte\u2019s family had spent most of their savings on legal fees. Meanwhile, Schulte remains in federal custody.

We lost many of these brilliant minds in 2016. Around this time of each year one tends to take stock of things that happened through the year. While you\u2019re doing the maths for your personal life, news outlets prepare lists of all the notable and noteworthy events that occurred that year. This includes lists of prominent individuals who have died, categorized by the fields in which they were prominent. So you find lists of musicians, actors, writers, even politicians who died that year, published in non-speciality publications. In other words, outlets like Vanity Fair are not the only publishers of lists of actors who died\u200a\u2014\u200aeven The New York Times and less prominent local news outlets publish these lists. To be sure, these individuals left an indelible mark and made a difference to scores of casual viewers/listeners and even connoisseurs, but it has never failed to surprise me how little ink is devoted to scientists who have also left their mark on this world. While scientific publications do devote vital space for these obituaries, if conventional non-science media also wrote about the passing of scientists it would be one small step in the direction of making science a more accessible professional option. This year there has been much discussion on the unusually large number of celebrity deaths, and as I write this there is news of George Michael\u2019s passing. One reason attributed to this larger number is because we\u2019re at a time when pop culture icons who flourished in the 1960s are now well past their 70s, and some having lived a hedonistic life have died earlier than others. And while we deeply regret their passing, we are able to look back and reflect on their impressive repertoire and the lives they touched through their works. Through these reflections and obituaries available from innumerable outlets, there are many who are only now introduced to that impressive repertoire, and it\u2019s not uncommon that an artiste gains new followers upon their passing. Scientists by and large are unfortunately not afforded the same level of publicity\u200a\u2014\u200anot during their lives, nor when they die. Even Nobel laureates remain in the public eye at best in early October when the Prizes are announced, and December when the ceremonies occur. How many people will be able to name the 2016 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, or physiology and medicine? And how many will be able to name the 2016 Nobel laureate in literature? I reckon the ratio will be 100:1 in favor of remembering the literature laureate, irrespective of whether you are familiar with Bob Dylan\u2019s repertoire. The scientists we lost this year made discoveries and influenced their fields to such an extent that not just their own research, but also that of their peers has affected our lives. While many prominent scientists died this year, a case in point would be the passing of Roger Yonchien Tsien. Tsien, along with his co-awardees Osamu Shimomura and Martin Chalfie, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry, \u201cfor the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP\u201d. GFP or green fluorescent protein is protein found in jellyfish, that is small enough to be engineered to be attached to cellular proteins without disrupting their activity to any appreciable extent. This pathbreaking technology has been adopted in almost every life science laboratory, and has enabled the development of a variety of biosensors. Using these biosensors, our understanding of brain development and morphology has outpaced previous efforts. In fact GFP based biosensors have been used to study every organ and the results have provided a basis for a deeper understanding of many diseases. Including cancer. And it is only when we understand diseases that we can move to developing cures and arresting them. Susan Lindquist was another visionary scientist who died this year. From cancer. In a profile by The Scientist published in January 2016, Lindquist said \u201cI like to do high-risk and high-payoff kind of research. And I had a gut feeling that MIT was a cool place to be with people who are fearless.\u201d Her area of research was studying how proteins fold within a cell, and the cellular machinery recruited to shepherd the process of folding as well as folded proteins across the cell.

While this article is not intended to supply an exhaustive list of scientists who died in 2016, it is an effort to raise the question of why mention of scientists\u2019 contributions when they die, is restricted to obituaries alone; and how integrating scientists in lists of deceased celebrities is important if we intend to give science its due place in society. By promoting the accomplishments of scientists if not through the course of their lives, at least in their deaths, we will not only give them their due but also acquaint the public with the importance of their discoveries, and the critical need to continue to fund basic scientific research.

Reporters asked Nielsen if she questioned a 2017 intelligence community assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed efforts to meddle in the presidential election to try and help President Trump. Nielsen said she was unaware of that assessment, which has been public for over a year. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have seen that conclusion,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cThat the specific intent was to help President Trump win \u2015 I\u2019m not aware of that, but I do generally have no reason to doubt any intelligence assessment.\u201d Nielsen\u2019s comments come as top intelligence officials\u00a0say Russia is likely to meddle again and the Department of Homeland Security is working with states to improve election security ahead of the 2018 midterms. Nielsen was on Capitol Hill Tuesday with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, to brief members of Congress on election security. Nielsen added that Russia had attempted to target \u201cpublic confidence on both sides\u201d in 2016 and would continue to do so in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen them encourage people to go to a protest on one side. We\u2019ve seen them simultaneously encourage to people to go the same protest on the other side.

We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\u201d the report said.  \u00a0\u201cWe also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment,\u201d it added.

Houlton added that she was not undermining it. \u201cThe Secretary has previously reviewed the intelligence community\u2019s assessment and agrees with it \u2013 as she stated today and previously,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cRussian goals included undermining faith in the U.S. democratic process and harming a candidate\u2019s electability and potential presidency. \u00a0Importantly, they targeted both major political parties.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to answer questions about whether he agreed with the 2017 intelligence community assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t have any observations to make about it,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill. McConnell also refused to weigh in on whether he thought it was appropriate for Trump to intervene in a Department of Justice investigation \u2015 especially one concerning him and his 2016 presidential campaign. The president last week directed the DOJ to investigate claims that the FBI surveilled his campaign prior to the election. The Justice Department, in turn, responded by asking its inspector general to look into Trump\u2019s charge as part of an existing probe.

Handsets with bendable and foldable screens could hit shelves as early as February 2017, according to a report from Bloomberg. Smartphone maker Samsung is preparing to release two such devices next year, hoping to get out in front of an emerging trend in smartphone tech, per the report. One of Samsung's bendy phones would fold in half, sort of like an old-school flip phone. The other would have a 5-inch screen that could unspool into an 8-inch display. Both devices would use organic light-emitting diodes to create a thin, plastic screen that can bend without breaking. \u00a0 To get a sense of what the rollable device might look like, check out this video of a Samsung prototype featured at a tech conference in San Francisco back in May: The company also gave the public a peek at some of its foldable phone concepts in this (painfully cheesy) video from 2014 (below). If you can ignore the dialogue and plot, you'll get a pretty good sense of a Samsung-made foldable phone: Samsung has been working on flexible displays since at least 2013. Other mobile phone companies have been tinkering with bendy screens for years, too. Electronics giant LG\u00a0earlier this year unveiled an 18-inch flexible screen prototype.

Male birth control may be years out, but there are pills and injections in the works that are already stopping the flow of sperm in trials. These new methods tout all the orgasm without all the mess (and babies). Several outlets are hailing\u00a0Vasalgel, a reversible form of birth control that blocks the flow of sperm after being injected into the vas deferens, the duct that brings sperm from the testes to the urethra. But it's way too early to celebrate -- the polymer injection is in pre-clinical trials and has only been successfully administered to 12 rabbits. Still, the results, released on Tuesday, are promising. Vasalgel is meant to serve as an easily reversible replacement for vasectomy. Rather than severing the vas deferens, as doctors do for vasectomy, Vasagel\u00a0 would be injected to create a gel barrier for sperm.\u00a0(Vasalgel appears to have no effect on orgasm or ejaculation, and even though sperm is blocked, seminal fluids can still be released.)\u00a0 When a man wants to reverse the process, a second injection would dissolve the polymer and open the vas deferens for business. Clinical trials in humans should take place later this year, according to a press release by the Parsemus Foundation, which developed the contraceptive. It's not yet clear how long the first injection will last, though it worked for a year in rabbits. \"We expect [that time frame]\u00a0to be similar in men, but that is just a minimum,\" Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, told Cosmopolitan.\u00a0\"It seems to be pretty durable;\u00a0we expect it to last for years.\u00a0We just don't know how many yet.\" In the United Kingdom, the future of male birth control may lie in the \"clean sheets pill,\" a non-hormonal contraceptive that inhibits the release of semen altogether by contracting muscles\u00a0and putting a clamp on the vas deferens, The Guardian reports. The pill has also been tested only in animals, and experts say we need more clinical studies on these products in the United States. \"We may be years away from viable new options for male birth control, but we are moving in that direction,\" said Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt,\u00a0co-director of The Personalized Urology & Robotics (PUR) Clinic at South Lake Hospital in Florida, who wrote about male contraceptives for Live Science. \"Most research is currently taking place in areas where birth control is more urgent due to population spikes, like China, India and Africa.

That\u2019s a pretty big deal for one reason: Humans have had to adapt to the needs of computers since they were first invented. To use a desktop computer, you had to learn how to navigate an on-screen cursor with a mouse, double-click icons to launch programs and type commands with a keyboard. Even smartphones \u2015 a streamlined evolution of personal computers \u2015 aren\u2019t exactly intuitive devices.

But computers and software that respond to voice commands flip the equation. Rather than requiring you to figure them out, the opposite is true: They need to understand your natural way of communicating and deliver results accordingly. Software that can read your emotions will be able to do that even more efficiently. Some of the most significant thinkers in technology \u2015 like IBM\u2019s Rob High \u2015 are working on leveraging artificial intelligence to make this transformation happen. New products that work in this milieu are coming from the likes of\u00a0Google\u00a0and ASUS.

The net result is that you might soon be able to avoid frustrating tech support conversations like this: The arcane steps required by the personal computers of today will no doubt be distant history by the time our kids are entering the workforce. That's pretty cool. Of course, some caution that it's not all roses and sunshine in the land of emotionally sensitive bots.

The robot deployed in Dallas is normally used to disarm explosives, Mashable reported, but police outfitted it with a bomb that was delivered to the suspect and detonated. \u201cWe saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,\u201d Dallas Police Chief David Brown told the outlet.\u00a0 Both the Dallas County Sheriff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas use a type of robot called Marcbot-IV,\u00a0according to a database operated by Bard College. These devices are explicitly created to dispose of explosives. They look like this:\u00a0 The Dallas Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for more details from The Huffington Post. Meanwhile, a\u00a0report from Popular Science indicated that the Dallas Police Department used a different type of bomb disposal robot, called a \u201cRemotec,\u201d to access an armored van during a standoff last year. Over 90 percent of police bomb squad units use Remotecs, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman,\u00a0the military technology company behind the robot, told Vice last year. Northrop Grumman declined to comment when reached by HuffPost. Whether the robot in this case was a Marcbot-IV or Remotec, it\u2019s worth reiterating a couple of things: The robot wasn\u2019t a drone, wasn\u2019t autonomous and wasn\u2019t originally designed to kill anyone. You could think of it like a really big, really complex Tyco R/C car. As Quartz Technology Reporter Mike Murphy put it: @dlberes this ain\u2019t a killer robot tho really \u2014 they could\u2019ve strapped the bomb to a skateboard if that\u2019d worked Still, the fact remains that the police deployed a robot with the intent to kill a suspect, which some say sets a worrying precedent about lethal force that\u2019s completely separate from the ethical considerations of shooting a gun. \u201cThe legal framework for police use of force assumes human decision-making about immediate human threats,\u201d Elizabeth Joh, a professor of law specializing in policing and technology at the University of California Davis, told HuffPost.\u00a0\u201cWhat does that mean when the police are far away from a suspect posing a threat? What does \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 lethal robotic force look like?\u201d Joh recognizes that this wasn\u2019t a complex killing machine, but she argues its deployment indicates how easy it would be for police to launch more advanced weaponry without oversight. After all, they transformed a bomb disposal robot into a bomb delivery robot. \u201cThis seems to be a jury-rigged robot. What happens when a police department buys the first AI police robot capable of lethal force? No clear answers, but the future\u2019s already here,\u201d Joh said. Some have made the case that robots with the capacity to kill could actually help save lives. In an interview with HuffPost last month, noted robotics expert Ronald Arkin said these autonomous weapons could theoretically be used to protect people in certain situations. \u201cThe hope is that if these systems can be designed appropriately and used in situations where they will be used appropriately; that they can reduce collateral damage significantly,\u201d Arkin told HuffPost at the time. More details are sure to emerge about the Dallas \u201crobot bomb,\u201d but one thing\u2019s certain: It\u2019s worth addressing the ethical concerns now, before these machines are rolling through our streets or floating through the skies.'}.

So my graduate students and I decided that whatever lecture I might have had planned could wait. We projected Twitter onto the board and began to analyze comments in hopes of understanding what this dreadful incident could show us about how to handle a corporate crisis. And in the process we learned what a weak and disingenuous CEO statement can suggest about corporate values and culture. First, of course, we watched the hideous video. Seeing a man beaten and dragged from his seat, while shocked passengers wailed and videotaped from all angles, left us speechless for a moment. But as we watched the incident a second and third time\u2014as most viewers will, we arrived at the inevitable question: How bad does the whole system at United have to be for things to spin this badly out of control, this fast? The answer, of course, was provided by United CEO Oscar Munoz himself in the form of a singularly bad public statement we found almost immediately on Twitter. Many of the organizational and cultural woes at United were right there for all to see, not just between the lines\u2014but literally easily identified in every line of that statement. So what can the Munoz statement tell us? Wow. In poker, I believe they call this a \u201ctell.\u201d The first line is an opportunity to convey authenticity, empathy, leadership, and integrity. But not here. This opener suggests that, at least as far as Munoz is concerned, this incident is first and foremost distressing to everyone at United? Really? This may come as a bit of a shock to the innocent passenger who was the victim of the beating, to his fellow passengers who were traumatized by the attack, to the entire traveling public riveted by the viral video, and anyone on the planet with access to Twitter. Here\u2019s the reality: Virtually no one in the audience at whom this statement is directed cares about how unsettling this event is for everyone at United. This opening line suggests an unwillingness to address victims of this incident\u2014and might as well read, \u201cWe at United are primarily unsettled by bad publicity. Damn those cell phones with their video cameras.\u201d A reasonable reader\u2019s takeaway: If an event like this doesn\u2019t cause some soul-searching at United, nothing will. I\u2019m going to try to avoid United at all costs. Incredibly, with this line, the United CEO doubles down on his stubborn insistence that this incident is primarily about someone other than the passenger who was beaten. Apologizing to some other group of passengers doesn\u2019t even remotely achieve the objective of redirecting our attention from the bloody face of that poor man; it only increases our realization that the CEO intends to misdirect rather than resolve. Indeed it also makes us more eager to know more about the victim, the broken operational system, and corporate culture that led to the attack. And neither does injecting a stilted, unhelpful verb like \u201cre-accommodate,\u201d redirect our attention from the storm troopers. If the first rule of a good communications strategy is authenticity, then the first sign of a truly bad one is having to dig deep into Merriam Webster for a verb that is supposed to sound vaguely official, but really suggests a desire for diversion and a lack of regard for the truth, not to mention an absence of empathy. A reasonable reader\u2019s takeaway: United is either not sorry or not in control of the situation, as evidenced by this \u2018re-accommodation\u2019 red herring. After an incident like this, one of the only ways to rebuild trust is to insist on an independent and open inquiry to identify weaknesses in a system that broke down so completely. There is no real sense here that accountability or transparency are of great importance; rather the focus on \u201cour own detailed review\u201d suggests that United thinks it may be qualified to get to the bottom of the situation on its own. Clearly we\u2019re past that point. A reasonable reader\u2019s takeaway: United will come up with some sort of story in coming days (and victim blaming is quite likely), but has no real intention of examining the culture that let this happen or overhauling the system that will practically ensure that it happens again. Munoz Statement Line 4: We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.  At last this neutral mention of the passenger and the \u201csituation\u201d comes too late to convey any empathy or outrage. Instead it just sounds like an obligatory nod to the elephant in the room\u2014the passenger with the bloody face who hasn\u2019t been mentioned at all so far by the CEO, even though he is now a global star on Twitter. A reasonable reader\u2019s takeaway: If they would have talked directly to the passenger, this never would have happened in the first place. Indeed, if this happened to that passenger, it could happen to me. Better to just avoid United. Beyond the general inadequacy of this statement as a tool for managing the crisis, it also reveals profound weaknesses in policy, values and culture at United. There was clearly no holding statement ready (or it wasn\u2019t used) in anticipation of a crisis, despite the chaos and complaints that arise from overbooking hundreds of times every day at an airline. This begs the question: If they don\u2019t have a contingency plan for utterly predictable customer service issues, do they have contingency plans for safety, security, or mechanical problems? One of the serious systemic issues this incident exposes and the scary questions it raises are about chaos, about lack of managerial engagement and sloppiness that United will have to now answer forever. But beyond systemic failure, the apparent belief in the C-Suite at United that this CEO Statement was either in line with the corporate values they say they demand\u2014integrity, competence, respect\u2014or compatible with a sustainable corporate culture that insists on transparency, collaboration, accountability and humanity\u2014suggests there are moral bankruptcies that can precede financial ones. One thing is for sure: No one who read this statement came away with a sense that passengers are at the top of the United Airlines priority list. Or possibly even on that list at all.'}.

Buffett, 86, used his investment savvy to build Berkshire into a powerhouse conglomerate and become the world\u2019s second-richest person. Known to fans as \u201cthe Oracle of Omaha,\u201d he estimated that the search for outperformance has caused investors to \u201cwaste\u201d more than $100 billion over the past decade. On Saturday, he called Vanguard Group founder Jack Bogle \u201ca hero\u201d for his early efforts to popularize index funds. Berkshire itself has done far better, with its stock price gaining 20.8 percent per year since Buffett took over in 1965, dwarfing the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\u2019s 9.7 percent gain, including dividends. Yet Buffett said most stock investors are better off with low-cost index funds than paying higher fees to managers who often underperform. In 2014, Buffett said he plans to put 90 percent of the money he leaves to his wife Astrid when he dies into an S&P 500 index fund, and 10 percent in government bonds. During the financial crisis, Buffett bet a founder of the asset management company Protege Partners LLC $1 million that a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund would outperform several groups of hedge funds over years. The index fund is up 85.4 percent, Buffett said, while the hedge fund groups are up between 2.9 percent and 62.8 percent. On Saturday, Buffett said he has \u201cno doubt\u201d he will win the bet. He plans to donate the money to Girls Inc of Omaha. While Buffett said no pension funds or \u201cmega-rich individuals\u201d have taken his advice on index funds and that \u201chuman behavior won\u2019t change,\u201d some investors are following his lead. Despite a roaring stock market in the United States, actively managed mutual funds bled $342 billion last year, their second straight year of outflows. Passive index funds and exchange-traded funds, meanwhile, attracted nearly $506 billion of new money. But Tim Armour, CEO of Capital Group Cos, which runs the American Funds and invests $1.4 trillion, said index funds can expose investors to losses when markets turn sour. The funds are one of Berkshire\u2019s biggest investors. \u201cWe don\u2019t dispute the data that has led Mr. Buffett and others to form their views,\u201d Armour said in a statement. \u201cHowever, a fairly simple fact has gotten lost in the debate. Simply put, not all investment managers are average.\u201d \u00a0 Berkshire on Saturday also said fourth-quarter profit rose 15 percent from a year earlier, as gains from investments and derivatives offset lower profit from the BNSF railroad and other units. Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks including Apple Inc , Coca-Cola Co, Wells Fargo & Co and the four biggest U.S. airlines, and more than one-fourth of Kraft Heinz Co. This year\u2019s letter and Berkshire\u2019s annual report gave no clues about who will succeed Buffett as chief executive officer, a question shareholders and Wall Street have speculated about increasingly in recent years. But Buffett lavishly praised Berkshire executive Ajit Jain, widely considered a leading CEO candidate, for smoothly running much of the conglomerate\u2019s insurance businesses. Jain joined Berkshire in 1986, and Buffett put him in charge of National Indemnity\u2019s small, struggling reinsurance operation. Since then, Jain has \u201ccreated tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don\u2019t hesitate. Make the trade!\u201d Berkshire, which became one of the top 10 Apple investors in 2016, has gained about $1.6 billion on its Apple investment after shares of the iPhone maker surged. Berkshire\u2019s airline investments suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump by name in his letter. But he did, however, talk up the vibrancy of U.S. society and its inclusion of immigrants, one of the most polarizing issues under the Trump administration. And he said the future of American business and markets is bright. \u201cOne word sums up our country\u2019s achievements: miraculous,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cFrom a standing start 240 years ago - a span of time less than triple my days on earth - Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\u201d \u00a0 (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and David Gregorio)'}.

In a flurry of tweets, Trump bashed the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, claiming it\u2019s a \u201cscam\u201d\u00a0that has cost nearly $20 million. Five days earlier,\u00a0Trump\u00a0tweeted it cost $10 million; the new reference may include the amount his own budget set aside for the probe for the 2019 fiscal year. As he has before, Trump accused the probe\u2019s investigators of being biased against him, claiming they were \u201c13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats.\u201d He failed to mention Mueller is a Republican.

Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.

Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.? Trump\u2019s latest Twitter rant against the Mueller investigation follows a damning report published Friday by The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, and his August 2016 meeting with an envoy representing the crown princes of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0The envoy offered to help the Trump presidential campaign, according to the Times. Trump and his legal team have repeatedly called for an end to Mueller\u2019s investigation, which entered its second year this month. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to lead the Russia investigation after Trump fired former FBI director James Comey\u00a0a year ago this month. Trump\u2019s tweets Sunday mark his latest efforts to undermine the Justice Department and the U.S. intelligence community\u00a0\u2015 a tactic he has used repeatedly since several federal agencies jointly determined the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in order to help Trump win. \u201cAs many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,\u201d Trump tweeted in March. \u201cThe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s repeated attacks, the majority of Americans have said they support Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, according to a poll conducted in April by The Washington Post and ABC News.'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Public opposition to Plaquemines Parish coal terminals grows', body='(This article is published in \"The Louisiana Weekly\" in the Aug. 19, 2013 edition.) Louisiana, a major exporter of coal from other states, could ship far more of that fossil fuel once the Panama Canal is widened and deepened in 2015. Next year, RAM Terminals, LLC hopes to build a coal export facility in Plaquemines Parish in Myrtle Grove near Ironton--30 miles south of New Orleans. As RAM rounds up its government permits, Ironton residents fear for their health. Environmentalists worry about the terminal's proximity to a planned Mississippi River diversion for building land.  But at Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, concerns about the terminal have eased from a year ago. And the project is supported by the parish since it might create 150 jobs.  RAM Terminals, LLC was formed in 2011 by Kentucky-based RAMACO, a coal reserve and infrastructure-development group. Last week, Louisiana's Dept. of Natural Resources held public meetings in Davant Wednesday and Belle Chasse Thursday to discuss RAM's application for a Coastal Use Permit from DNR.  \"The terminal will only add to respiratory problems we already have from a grain elevator and two oil refineries nearby,\" fifth-generation Ironton resident Audrey Trufant Salvant said last week. \"We're concerned about a railroad we hear they want to run along the Mississippi and through the back of our town to carry coal. Trains could be running constantly. Right now the rail ends at the CHS grain elevator north of us.\" In addition to the RAM terminal, Salvant and her neighbors have heard two more coal export facilities could be built nearby by other companies. Braithwaite is one of the sites under consideration. Salvant acknowledged that riverside industries provide local jobs. \"But these facilities have to be maintained so that they aren't choking us,\" she said. \"And too many of them close together isn't good.\" Driving down Highway 23, Salvant can see piles of coal at the International Marine Terminals two and a half miles south of Ironton. IMT, owned by Kinder Morgan, is in the process of expanding. \"The coal isn't covered,\" Salvant said. \"Ariel photos show coal dust blowing and seeping into the river. Last August during Hurricane Isaac, coal-contaminated floodwater spread from the terminals to other properties.\" Talk is that the mostly African American Ironton, with 150 residents, might be moved from the vicinity of the RAM terminal though the company has denied such plans. \"Recently, we're hearing it could be south,\" Salvant said. \"We certainly don't want to move south and be more vulnerable to hurricanes and coastal erosion.\" The meeting Wednesday in Davant on the East Bank wasn't easy for Ironton residents on the West Bank to reach. \"We'd have to take a ferry to get there,\" Salvant said. \"So we demanded that the Dept. of Natural Resources hold a West Bank meeting on the permit, and it did in Belle Chasse Thursday night.\" Davant is the site of coal exporter United Bulk Terminals, owned by Oiltanking. UBT is across the river and slightly south of the International Marine Terminals coal facility.  The Dept. of Natural Resources heard public comments on RAM's Coastal Use Permit application Wednesday at Percy Griffin Community Center in Davant and Thursday at the Belle Chasse Auditorium. About fifty people turned out for the Davant hearing, according to Scott Eustis, coastal wetland specialist at the Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans Thursday. One concern discussed in Davant was the possibility that coal trains will run south below where the rails end now at the CHS grain elevator. \"These trains could be up to 100 cars long, carrying uncovered coal down through Plaquemines, filling the air with dust, tying up vehicular traffic and making residents late for work and school,\" Eustis said. Thursday's Belle Chasse permit meeting attracted 120 people, including Ironton and Myrtle Grove residents who complained of asthma and allergies from existing riverside facilities, Nancy Nusser of the Clean Gulf Commerce Coalition said Friday. \"People lined up to take the podium, and no one from the public spoke in favor of the terminal during the four-hour hearing,\" she said. As for its coal-export ranking, Louisiana is the nation's second-largest shipper after Virginia. In data released by the National Mining Association in May, the Pelican State accounted for 20 percent of U.S. coal exports in 2011. But the rationale for more coal export facilities was questioned at the Davant meeting, especially given pessimism about China's imports, Eustis said. In May, Goldman Sachs predicted China's imports will decline as that nation's production of coal, nuclear energy and wind power increases. Deutsche Bank said this spring that China's coal imports could soften because its urbanizing interior is near coal mines and away from coastal ports.  Stan Mathes, Plaquemines Parish economic development director, said last week that local coal terminals are gearing up for a wider, deeper Panama Canal by 2015 and hope to meet Chinese and Indian demand. He noted that some of Indonesia's coal exports are low quality and no longer acceptable to China. As for India, its coal imports continue to grow, according to official Indian statistics. Meanwhile, RAM's application to operate awaits a Water Quality Certification from Louisiana's Dept. of Environmental Quality and a Compensatory Mitigation Plan, in addition to the Coastal Use Permit from the DNR, according to Ricky Boyett, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman in New Orleans, last week. A compensatory mitigation plan is a wetland plan that's acceptable to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Louisiana Dept. of Wildlife and Fisheries and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \"RAM must first obtain a Coastal Use Permit from the state and a 404 Permit from the Army Corps before they may begin construction,\" Louisiana DEQ spokesman Tim Beckstrom said last week. \"They will need a water permit from us but those other permits must be in place first.\" DEQ gave RAM an air-quality permit last September. A 404 Permit, authorizing construction in wetlands, is issued by the Army Corps under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.  In an April 30, 2012 letter to New Orleans engineers Lanier and Associates--which was hired by RAM Terminals in 2011--Jerome Zeringue, executive director of the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, questioned whether RAM's terminal could exist with the state's planned river diversion at Myrtle Grove. He raised concerns about ship movement, barge fleeting, river piloting and the terminal's impact on river sediments. \"Since then, CPRA has modeled potential impacts, and analyzed and addressed issues,\" Zeringue said last week. \"We now believe the two projects can co-exist. We will have enough room to operate near the proposed coal facility. We'll be able to build and use the river diversion to create land.\"  In May 2011, RAM acquired 602 acres on the lower Mississippi River to develop its export terminal, with fleeting operations. Because of CPRA's concerns that the coal terminal could affect its planned Mid Barataria Sediment Diversion, a Memorandum of Agreement was drawn up identifying conditions under which RAM's facility can function. \"This MOA is in the process of being executed by the state and RAM Terminals\" with respect to RAM's Coastal Use Permit application, Zeringue said last week. Under the MOA, RAM wouldn't use its terminal during a \"Peak Operating Period,\" which can be declared by the state when the Mississippi River is flowing at or above 600,000 cubic feet per second at the U.S. Geological Survey station at Baton Rouge. During a declared POK, CPRA would capture as much sediment as quickly as possible to minimize the period's length. A POK wouldn't exceed fifteen days in a row, and no more than five of these peak periods could be declared in a calendar year. When asked if possible air and water pollution from coal might impact the Myrtle Grove diversion, Zeringue said that will be a DEQ permitting issue. \"DEQ should be able address any pollution concerns along the river,\" he said. \"CPRA's function with the diversion is to help rebuild and maintain our coastline.\"  Zeringue provided a timeline for work on the diversion. \"It's in the design process, as we progress through the permitting process--all of which could take two years,\" he said. \"By summer 2015, the diversion's design plans, a required environmental impact study involving federal agencies, and permitting should be complete. After that, construction may take another two years. From the most optimistic projection, the soonest the diversion can begin operating is probably five years from now.\" The Myrtle Grove diversion is expected to create 33 square miles of wetlands in Barataria Basin, Zeringue said. \"It will function as the Mississippi River did when it built land, before significant investments were made to channelize the river after the great flood of 1927,\" he said.

But if you find it particularly hard to stay away from social media, your personality may be partly to blame. According to a new study, people with certain personality traits are more likely to develop a social media addiction. \u201cThere has been plenty of research on how the interaction of certain personality traits affects addiction to things like alcohol and drugs,\u201d study co-author Isaac Vaghefi, an assistant professor of information systems at Binghamton University in New York state,\u00a0said in a statement. But relatively few studies have looked at how personality traits may affect tech addiction, including addiction to social media, the researchers said. [7 Signs Your Child Is an iPad Addict] In the new study, the researchers surveyed about 300 college students to assess their personality and gauge their level of addiction to the\u00a0social media\u00a0site each individual used most frequently. (Questions to measure social media addiction included: \u201cI sometimes neglect important things because of my interest in this social networking website\u201d; \u201cWhen I am not using this social networking website, I often feel agitated\u201d; and \u201cI have made unsuccessful attempts to reduce the time I interact with this social networking website.\u201d) The study found that three personality traits in particular \u2014\u00a0neuroticism, conscientiousness and agreeableness \u2014 were related to social media addiction. Two other personality traits, extraversion and openness to experience, weren\u2019t linked with social media addiction. Specifically, the researchers found that people with high levels of neuroticism, or the tendency to experience negative emotions such as stress and anxiety, were more likely to develop\u00a0addiction to social media, compared with people who had low levels of neuroticism. In contrast, people with high levels of conscientiousness, or the tendency to have impulse control and a strong drive to achieve specific goals, were less likely to develop addiction to social media. However, the researchers noted that even people with high conscientiousness could be prone to social media addiction if they were also high in neuroticism. This may be because high levels of stress and anxiousness could override a person\u2019s perceived control over their social media use, the researchers said. In addition, the trait of agreeableness \u2014 or the degree to which someone is friendly, empathetic and helpful \u2014 by itself had no effect on social media addiction. But this was not true when the researchers looked at agreeableness in combination with conscientiousness. They found that people with low levels of both agreeableness and conscientiousness were more likely to develop social media addiction than people with average levels of these personality traits. But surprisingly, people with high levels of both of these\u00a0personality traitswere also more likely to develop social network addiction, compared to people with average levels of the two traits. It\u2019s possible that people who have high levels of both agreeableness and conscientiousness make a conscious decision to use social networks more, in order to help their friendships flourish, the researchers said. It\u2019s important to note that because the study involved a few hundred college students at a single university, more research is needed to confirm the findings, the researchers said. But they added that the findings could have implications for those who treat tech addictions. \u201cOur findings explain that users with higher levels of IT addictions may not be considered as one homogeneous group of users, as different personality traits can play different roles in users\u2019 dispositions toward IT addiction,\u201d the researchers wrote in\u00a0their paper, which was presented in January at the 51st Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science. Vaghefi added that he hopes the findings will encourage people to look at the \u201cwhole picture\u201d of how personality traits affect tech addiction, \u201crather than just focusing on one personality trait\u201d at a time.

The woman initially claimed that during her time with Greitens,\u00a0who was then preparing his campaign for governor, he took nude photos of her without her permission.

Unfortunately, advocates for the Canadian government's position (\"industry officials\") were able to slip in a statement that was not fact checked with me: \"They note that Hansen's dire warning about Canada's unconventional oil deposits was based on the assumption that every ounce of oil in the sands would be burned. Only a small fraction of the total estimated reserves is recoverable, and doing so will take decades.\" First, note that the carbon from fossil fuel burning will stay in the climate system for more than 100,000 years before it is buried on the ocean floor as carbonates. So whether it takes a few decades (or even a few centuries) to extract the fuel is pretty irrelevant -- we would be screwing up the planet for our children, grandchildren and, as Native Americans say, the seventh generation. Second, what I said is that oil in the total tar sands resource is more than double all oil that has been burned in the history of humankind, i.e., less than half of the tar sands is sufficient to match all oil burned so far. (And note that non-tar sands oil is being burned to extract the tar sands goop and process it to make oil, and forests above the tar sands are being destroyed, making the tar sands impact even greater.) If we build big pipeline infrastructure, you can be sure that technology developments will allow more and more to be extracted. There is another error in the New Yorker article, an explanation of the origin of the name of Bill McKibben's organization 350.org: \"The name is a nod to Hansen's calculation that once the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeds three hundred and fifty parts per million, climate change could become uncontainable.\" In reality, 350 ppm is the CO2 level that, other things being unchanged, would restore Earth's energy balance. So 350 ppm is an estimate of the CO2 level needed to stabilize global temperature. Temperature is now near the upper end of its range during the Holocene, the interglacial period now more than 10,000 years long, which is the climate that civilization is adapted to. It may be necessary to go somewhat lower than 350 ppm to avoid multi-meter sea level rise, so 350 ppm is only an initial estimate for a long-term target. We will know better by the time we get CO2 turned around heading toward 350 ppm. It's unlikely we will want to go back all the way to pre-industrial 280 ppm, because there are other significant climate forcings. These include human-made change of the planet's surface albedo and natural forcings, which are providing a slight push toward global cooling. Yet the New Yorker's statement that \"climate change could become uncontainable,\" unfortunately, is not science fiction. If we are so foolish as to burn all fossil fuels, including all coal and unconventional fuels, that result is nearly certain. Our paper discussing that topic, \"Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide,\" by Hansen, Sato, Russell and Kharecha, is finally being published next week in the Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A PDF of the article will be freely available from my web site (http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/) or from the journal's web site. The attached note (\"Europe Standing Tall Against a Rogue State\") was written to accompany \"Tar Sands Debacle and the Hama-Hama-Hama Oil and Gas Corporation,\" which I hope to finish soon. I include the note now because the situation in Europe is fluid. The Canadian government (not representative of Canada, as I note) is trying to work a backroom deal to avoid an open vote on unconventional fossil fuels. Does anybody have a guess as to why the Canadian Prime Minister jumped at the chance to line up Canada in favor of Obama's plan to bomb Syria?

We examine lives and journeys that have led to significant achievements in the worlds of science, technology, finance, medicine, law, the arts and numerous other endeavors. Our latest interviewee is Bobak Ferdosi. Bobak Ferdowsi is the Fault Protection lead on the NISAR joint Earth observation mission with India at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His prior positions have included Launch, Cruise, Approach Engineering Lead and Flight Director on Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity, Science Planner on the Cassini mission, Flight Software Product Line System Engineer, and Europa Clipper Mission Planner.

Bobak has always wanted to find life elsewhere in our universe. He plays shortstop in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory softball league and usually rides his bike to work. Tell our readers where you grew up and walk us through your background. How did your family and surroundings influence you in your formative years? I was raised by my Iranian dad and American mother in the East Bay Area in California. Then, I moved to Tokyo for a couple of years, where I lived with my paternal aunt. I think living in the Bay Area in a multicultural household, and then moving overseas, contributed heavily to a sense of belonging to a global community, and recognizing the wonderful things each culture brings to the table. There\u2019s little doubt in my mind that one reason I love space exploration is that it can be a unifying force and experience for humankind. What has been your personal key to success? What were the biggest inspirations for your career? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m really successful yet (I mean I am very fortunate to get to do this job), but I think it\u2019s mostly been trying to improve myself both personally and professionally. I was lucky in that my first job connected me with some wonderful career mentors, allowing me to gradually learn what I enjoy doing, what I want from a career, and not feel pressured into career moves. I didn\u2019t appreciate that building robots to visit other planets was a job until shortly after graduating from high school in 1997, I watched the Mars Pathfinder land. How did you end up working in the space program? And how did you get on the Mars Curiosity team? After Mars Pathfinder, my path was pretty straightforward. I started out thinking about majoring in Physics instead of Aerospace Engineering, and worked in a physics laboratory for most of my time at college (I still love physics). After graduating from the University of Washington, which had an Aerospace Engineering department, I went to MIT for a Masters in the same field. From there, I was very lucky that a friend and classmate of mine ended up working at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory first, and helped me get my job. Curiosity ended up being mostly happenstance \u2013 there was a job opening when I was hired, and I started on it part-time until transitioning to full-time after about a year. You worked as a mission planner on NASA\u2019s first nuclear-powered Mars rover The Curiosity - one of the most technologically advanced mission to Mars yet. Could you tell our readers about the challenges of controlling a robot on Mars? Personally, a lot of the challenge was this was the first time for me. As an institution, JPL has landed a number of missions on Mars, and quite a few members of the team had prior experience doing so, so I tried learning from them what I could. More often than not, I learned how not to do things. Seems like most of our lessons learned tend to be \u201cthis didn\u2019t work so well, so let\u2019s try to do better next time,\u201d even in our biggest successes. Technically, one of the often-overlooked challenges (besides the complexity of such missions), is the time delay between Earth and the spacecraft / rover. At launch, the delay is seconds between command and the spacecraft acknowledgement, but by the time we reached Mars, that was 14 minutes round trip \u2013 the time it takes at the speed of light for our commands to get there, to execute, and then send back a response. Accordingly, we had to build in a lot of autonomy. There\u2019s no way to joystick a landing (or even operate it from day-to-day) with that delay, so the spacecraft and rover have to be able to execute things on their own without checking-in with humans. What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your career? Self-doubt. While I consider myself extremely fortunate to work here with such incredible people, the flip-side of that coin is that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to believe that I am at the same level. What advice would you give to students who want to take the same career path as you? Do it! It\u2019s a very satisfying career. Just remember it\u2019s not always easy, so learn to make connections with other people in the same boat. It\u2019ll help you be a better engineer (communication skills are crucial) and it\u2019ll help you when you\u2019re struggling. How can our readers stay current on what you\u2019re doing now? What are you exploring for the next few years? I tweet a fair amount (@tweetsoutloud), but really there\u2019s so much more going on at NASA and so I strongly recommend following as many of the NASA-operated accounts on social media (I think we\u2019re on every major one nowadays). I personally enjoy NASA JPL\u2019s (@NASAJPL) the most, since it covers a lot of our robotic missions as well as Earth sciences that I\u2019m very proud of. As for me, I recently transitioned from what promises to be an incredible mission to Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, to a joint Earth science mission with India\u2019s space agency called NISAR. The opportunity to work with an international partner on a mission that can really impact our understanding of our world, led me there. What excites you most about the future of NASA? Well, I\u2019m always excited to visit places in our solar system or learn about exoplanets (always with the hope that we\u2019ll learn we\u2019re not alone in the universe), but one of the most exciting things to me is that the future of NASA and the space industry in general. There is the increasing collaboration with private industry and international partners. Hopefully, this will allow the next generation of missions to represent even more of the world than ever so more people can participate. Your hairdo got the attention of the whole world during the landing. How did you create that fabulous hair? Did you ever think you would become a meme? What was it like to become an instant celebrity? Surreal. I don\u2019t think anyone goes into NASA thinking \u201cone day I\u2019ll be famous\u201d so I was caught off-guard. The emotions of the landing were a lot to deal with, but I was very fortunate that the team was supportive and I am really proud to help represent the project and agency that I care deeply about. My hair came from a tradition started a few years earlier of celebrating our major accomplishments with a different pattern in my hair \u2013 for example System Test 5 (our 5th major test of the vehicle here on Earth before launch) led to a Roman Numeral V on the side of my head. By the time of landing, everyone on our team knew I was going to do something, so my boss beat me to the punch, sending out a survey to the team to vote on what my hair should look like. What does being an Iranian-American mean to you? For me it means I feel like a global citizen. I\u2019m proud of both my heritages, but ultimately my allegiance is to helping to understand the context of what it means to be human and to help our planet and everyone on it. It\u2019s also a reminder to me that the future I want to see (and that I am trying to create) is one where we can better recognize we are all more the same than we are different. I think that the perspective of space is one powerful way to do that.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

In the prayer, Conroy urged Congress not to create \u201cwinners and losers\u201d under the Republican tax measure, which greatly benefits rich people over time. Ryan read that prayer as a \u201ctilt to the Democrats\u201d because it implied criticisms of the tax cuts helping the rich, Connolly said Republican lawmakers told him. \u201cThey cite that as evidence as that being more political than he\u2019s comfortable with,\u201d he said. Lawmakers in both parties have fumed about Ryan\u2019s move. Many learned last month that Conroy was leaving, but didn\u2019t know until last week that he had been forced out. And Catholics like Connolly have been suspicious that conservatives were pushing to relieve the urban Catholic Jesuit priest in order to replace him with someone more ideologically aligned with them. Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, all but confirmed their suspicions last week when he suggested the next chaplain should have a wife and a family \u2015 a requirement that would automatically exclude Catholic priests from the position. Amid outcry from Catholics, Walker later removed himself from a bipartisan committee to find a new House chaplain. Connolly said despite Walker\u2019s comments, some conservatives want to find a way to \u201crestore dignity for Father Conroy\u201d and to the House itself by keeping the chaplain on the job for at least the rest of the year. \u201cI know for a fact that some members of the Freedom Caucus felt this was handled badly and sends a signal of bigotry they don\u2019t want to be associated with,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen members so angry about something in this House in my 10 years. Because it\u2019s not only political and not only about your faith. It\u2019s personal.\u201d A Ryan spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on whether the speaker would be open to letting Conroy stay on for the year. Democrats unsuccessfully tried last week to pass a resolution creating a special committee to investigate why Ryan forced Conroy to resign. A GOP aide with a sense of the Republican conference later told HuffPost the resolution could have actually passed if Democrats had kept partisan language out of it. The measure, authored by Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), twice referred to the Republican tax plan as the \u201cGOP tax scam.\u201d Connolly said he hasn\u2019t spoken to Conroy yet about the bipartisan talks underway to keep him in his job. Asked why there should be anyone leading prayers in the House, given the country\u2019s grounding in the separation of church and state, Connolly said that\u2019s a different issue altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made for that, but that was an argument in 1774 and James Madison lost,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we have [a House chaplain], we\u2019ve got to be fair and can\u2019t be censored. People can\u2019t be fired for innocuous prayer. That\u2019s kind of where we are now.\u201d'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

In 2015, Chipotle faced a series of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, including an E. coli outbreak that spread across nine states, a salmonella outbreak in Minnesota and two separate\u00a0instances of norovirus. The crisis scared customers away and prompted big changes in the company\u2019s approach to food safety in its restaurants. But many customers haven\u2019t returned. In response to still-disappointing sales in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, Chipotle executives claimed in a conference call with investors last month that its struggles have more to do with customer-service issues\u00a0\u2014 long lines, messy dining rooms, ingredient shortages\u00a0\u2014 than with lingering concerns over the safety of its food, according to a Washington Post report. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll complicates that narrative. The poll, conducted from Dec. 21-22, found that just 36 percent of respondents said they were confident that the food served at Chipotle is safe to eat, while 24 percent of respondents said they were not confident in the food\u2019s safety. Another 40 percent said they were unsure. The lack of confidence in the safety of Chipotle\u2019s food outpaced the 14 percent of respondents who said they were not confident that the food served in most restaurants is safe to eat. When respondents were specifically asked if they believed Chipotle was either safer or less safe to eat at than most other restaurants, 21 percent of respondents said they believed eating at Chipotle was less safe. That number remained consistent even when the sample was narrowed to include just respondents who say they are customers of the chain, 20 percent of whom also agreed that the food at Chipotle is less safe than food at other restaurants. These findings suggest that a significant number of Chipotle customers still have concerns connected to the company\u2019s food safety scares. In a statement provided to HuffPost, Chipotle chief marketing and development officer Mark Crumpacker disputed that assessment, stating that the company\u2019s extensive internal research has shown that brand trust and admiration have essentially recovered to pre-crisis levels. The lagging sales, Crumpacker reiterated, are due to customers\u2019\u00a0less frequent visits\u00a0\u2014 not an outright avoidance. The company believes subpar customer experiences at some of the chain\u2019s locations is to blame. \u201cThe bottom line here is that there are many intertwined and complex reasons why we have not fully recovered our sales,\u201d Crumpacker added, \u201cbut the main reason is that our customers are not yet as frequent as they once were, not because they are concerned about food safety.\u201d For his part, food safety expert and frequent Chipotle critic Doug Powell said he believes the company is \u201cgrappling\u201d as it places blame for its slow recovery away from its food safety struggles. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re focusing on the basics,\u201d Powell, a former Kansas State University food safety professor and the publisher and editor of Barfblog, told HuffPost. \u201cWhether it\u2019s food safety or employee retention or whatever it is.\u201d Though the cause of Chipotle\u2019s slow rebound might be debatable, the chain\u2019s feeble sales numbers are not. The restaurant\u2019s sales have continued their sag over\u00a0the past four quarters and shares of the stock tumbled 6 percent last month when Chipotle CEO and founder Steve Ells, who was named sole CEO of the restaurant in December, admitted he was \u201cnervous\u201d about whether the chain will achieve a previously forecast uptick in sales in 2017. Shares of the stock have since rebounded, but the chain\u2019s outlook still remains uncertain. The company is set to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales numbers on Feb. 2. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 21-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

PREVIOUSLY: WASHINGTON \u2015 Top Democrats on Wednesday urged the Justice Department to scrap a classified briefing with top House Republicans regarding sensitive documents that the GOP lawmakers had requested about the Russia investigation, but said if the meeting was to go forward on Thursday, it ought to include lawmakers of both parties. Justice Department officials invited Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House intelligence committee, and committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to review information about an FBI informant who reportedly attempted to\u00a0make contact with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign advisers\u00a0prior to the 2016 election. The FBI had received evidence that the advisers had suspicious contacts linked to Russia. Last week President Trump accused the FBI\u00a0of \u201cspying\u201d on his campaign for \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d and demanded the Justice Department probe that investigation and alleged surveillance. On Wednesday,\u00a0he dubbed the FBI probe \u201cSPYGATE,\u201d tweeting that it \u201ccould be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\u201d These allegations are only the latest attempts from the president and his allies to discredit what is now special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. In a Wednesday letter,\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) blasted the planned meeting between Justice Department officials and GOP lawmakers as \u201ccompletely improper\u201d and warned that it \u201cwould set a damaging precedent for your institutions and the rule of law.\u201d\u00a0 In the letter addressed to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Democratic leaders argued that the meeting could create an opportunity for Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill to \u201cprematurely access investigatory information and selectively leak national security secrets\u201d in order to distort the facts about the Russia investigation, which has already yielded nearly two dozen indictments. \u201cHowever,\u201d they wrote, \u201cif you have determined in your best judgment that Justice Department participation in the meeting is the only way to prevent this situation from devolving into an outright constitutional crisis, then we believe you must insist on the only appropriate mechanism for highly sensitive briefings that might implicate intelligence sources and methods \u2015 a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers.\u201d\u00a0 The \u201cGang of Eight\u201d\u00a0consists of Schumer; Pelosi; Nunes; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.); House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.); Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee; Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee; and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.),\u00a0ranking member of the House intelligence committee. Schiff on Wednesday called the Democrats\u2019 exclusion from the classified briefing \u201ca serious abuse of power.\u201d Warner told a CNN reporter that he hoped the Justice Department \u201cwould not in any way be forced to reveal confidential information that would go against 75 years of practice.\u201d Several Republicans are also requesting to be included\u00a0in the Justice Department meeting, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa),\u00a0chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic who is not seeking re-election this year,\u00a0tweeted that excluding Democrats from the classified briefing \u201cis not right.\u201d\u00a0 This is not right.

This launch brings the aerospace company one step closer to making flights to space more affordable with reused rockets and capsules. A Falcon 9 rocket launched the recycled Dragon capsule at 5:07 p.m. local time Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shortly after the first-stage booster launched the Dragon into orbit, it fell away from the capsule,\u00a0flipped around, fired its engines and landed safely at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, according to Florida Today. As ABC News pointed out,\u00a0used rockets are now returned for a vertical touchdown as part of SpaceX\u2019s efforts to lower the cost of flights. The booster launched Saturday likely will be used again. The Dragon made its first trip to space in 2014, delivering food and supplies to the ISS, according to science news site Phys.org. It was refurbished after landing in the Pacific Ocean intact. Saturday\u2019s refurbished capsule will deliver\u00a06,000 pounds of supplies to the ISS, including mice and flies to be used for research, a roll-up solar panel, food and a neutron star detector, according to NBC News.

Col. Amy McGrath,\u00a0a retired Marine fighter pilot who launched a long-shot bid for Congress with a viral campaign video, won Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District. McGrath\u2019s primary opponent, Lexington Mayor Jim Gray,\u00a0called McGrath to concede the race just two hours after polls closed,\u00a0McGrath campaign manager Mark Nickolas told HuffPost.\u00a0Gray\u2019s campaign manager confirmed the concession call to the Lexington Herald-Leader. McGrath, who will face incumbent Republican Rep. Andy Barr in November, trailed Gray by as much as 40 points when he\u00a0entered the race in December, according to her internal polling, but steadily gained ground in the ensuing months with a campaign that sought to paint her\u00a0as an outsider running against Gray and the national Democratic establishment. McGrath and Gray hardly differed on the issues. They opposed Barr\u2019s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provides health insurance to tens of thousands of the district\u2019s residents, and both supported expanding the law instead. They were largely aligned on other issues, including support for minimum wage increases and opposition to the sweeping Republican tax cut package that Barr supported in 2017. But McGrath seems to have tapped into the same thirst for new political faces that has pushed newcomers \u2015 especially women \u2015 to victories in Democratic primaries across the country this year.\u00a0 Though she targeted rural voters outside Lexington, she also campaigned broadly as a progressive. She favors adding a public option to Obamacare, lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare and increasing federal funding for infrastructure and job programs in central Kentucky. She is in favor of abortion rights, is pro\u2013LGBTQ equality and is\u00a0vocally opposed to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to ban transgender troops from the military and bar refugees from majority-Muslim nations from entering the country.\u00a0 Now she\u2019ll face Barr, who first won the seat in 2012 and has cruised to re-election twice.

Rand Paul (R), and this year Democrats\u00a0flipped one state legislative seat\u00a0in a special election in a Trump-supporting district. The DCCC added the 6th Congressional District to its list of targets in 2018 as it tries to flip at least 24 seats for Democrats to regain the House majority.

If you\u2019re like most parents, the answer is probably: not much. If you ever needed a reason to start the conversation about money with your kids, here it is: the median savings balance among working households aged 50 to 55 is $8,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. For households aged 56 to 61, the median savings balance isn\u2019t much better, at just $17,000.  The only way we can combat this great financial plague and help ensure our younger generations don\u2019t continue to struggle is to teach them from a young age the right ways to make the big money.  Over the past 34 years, I\u2019ve had the chance to interview and observe more than 1,200 self-made millionaires. The lessons I watched the self-made rich teach their kids were mind blowing, and the polar opposite of what we are taught about money in middle-class America.  Here are seven of the secrets self-made millionaires teach their kids: You deserve to be rich Most people believe that you can only be rich if you were born into the right family, attended the best school or possess uncommon talent. While these advantages certainly help, they are by no means required to be rich. In a free market economy like America, if you serve enough people and solve enough problems, you deserve to be rich. This is capitalism at its best. Wealth creates freedom The best thing about wealth is the freedom it offers you. It\u2019s the freedom to live life on your own terms. Being rich allows you to live anywhere you want, do anything you want and be anything you want to be. If you want to start a business, take up a new sport, learn a language, donate to your favorite charity or anything else, all that\u2019s required is the decision to do so. Most important, having money eliminates financial worry and allows you the freedom to choose and enjoy life.  You\u2019re not entitled The world owes you nothing. No one is entitled to anything. It\u2019s up to you to create your own future. The idea of entitlement seems to be growing in popularity, yet it\u2019s based on the delusion that we are born with certain rights. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re just born. The rest is up to you. Teach your kids the opposite of the entitled mentality, which is self-reliance. The irony of this is that the more you exhibit your self-reliant attitude and don\u2019t act as if you need help, the more people want to help you. Get rich solving problems  The world wants you to be rich because it has a lot of challenges to solve. If you want to be rich, solve a problem. If you want to be very wealthy, solve a bigger problem. The larger the problem you solve, the richer you get. In a free market economy, that\u2019s all there is to it. I\u2019m not implying that getting rich is easy, but it is that simple. Match your unique talents, abilities and passions with a problem-solving idea, and you\u2019ll be on your way to wealth.  Think for yourself The average person is taught what to think. The millionaire in the making is taught how to think. Your kids will learn many great lessons from well-intentioned and well-educated individuals, but odds are that most of these people won\u2019t know the first thing about acquiring wealth. Teach your kids to think big, reach their own conclusions and blaze their own trail no matter who may criticize their ambition, doubt their ability and laugh at their vision. Raise your expectations  Many psychologists believe that people should lower their expectations so they won\u2019t be disappointed if they fail. They believe people will be happier expecting and settling for less. This is another mass oriented formula for failure. Teach your kids to stop living in fear, and instead, live in a world of possibilities, potential and opportunity. Let the middle class be satisfied with mediocrity while you reach for the stars. Remember, many of today\u2019s biggest success stories were mocked by doubters at one time.  Believe in yourself As a striver and achiever, you will attempt many great things. The odds are that some will be successful, and others won\u2019t. The road to world-class success is usually paved with setbacks, disappointments and failures. The secret to survival: never abandon yourself. No matter what happens in your life, you must always believe in yourself and your ability to handle whatever life throws at you. You may lose the popular vote, but never allow yourself to lose your own support. Always believe in yourself and your ability to comeback, even if everyone else gives up on you.  The takeaway Children learn from their parents, so start having conversations with your kids about money early on. Even parents who haven\u2019t been the most financially successful can see to it that their kids really understand what it takes to become wealthy. Imagine growing up being tutored on how to become a self-made millionaire. The advantages would be difficult to deny. '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Trump told the NRA convention in Dallas on Friday that a \u201conce very prestigious\u201d London hospital was \u201clike a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds.\u201d He said London has \u201cunbelievably tough gun laws,\u201d adding, \u201cthey don\u2019t have guns; they have knives and instead there\u2019s blood all over the floors of this hospital.\u201d He then stabbed the air several times, pretending to hold a knife, as he uttered, \u201cKnives, knives, knives.\u201d London political leaders and physicians condemned Trump\u2019s remarks and called any implication that guns would stem a troubling increase in knife violence outlandish. \u201cTo suggest guns are part of the solution is ridiculous,\u201d said surgeon Karim Brohi of the Royal London Hospital in a statement. \u201cGunshot wounds are at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Britain effectively banned handgun ownership\u00a0after a 1996 school shooting. According to figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,\u00a0the murder rate in the U.S. is approximately five times higher than Britain\u2019s. There were 4.9 intentional homicides per 100,000 people in 2015 in the U.S. and .90 per 100,000 in 2014 in Britain, according to the U.N. statistics. \u201cTrump lies on everything,\u201d former British justice secretary Charlie Falconer said before contrasting the nations\u2019 murder rates.

That was likely the source of Trump\u2019s comments.\u00a0At least 35 people were\u00a0fatally stabbed\u00a0in London by April of this year. But despite the recent spike,\u00a0London remains safe compared to a number American cities, the BBC recently reported. In 2017, London\u2019s murder rate per 100,000 people was 1.2. New York City\u2019s rate was nearly three times higher. Baltimore\u2019s rate was more than 45 times higher than London\u2019s, according to FBI data. In a tweet Saturday, Griffiths indicated that Trump missed his point about London violence entirely with an animation showing the words \u201cthe point\u201d floating over the head of a stick figure.

It was an interesting event, the substance of which (the \"energy-efficiency paradox\") I will write about in the future, but today's post is stimulated by a news article I read on board my flight, titled, \"U.S. and China May Find Agreements Outside Stymied Climate Talks.\" Bad News from Bonn In Bonn this past week, international negotiations continued under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  The two most important countries in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions -- China and the United States -- apparently engaged in a war of words on the fundamental question of who should do what.  In particular, these two giants -- and their respective allies in the developed and developing worlds -- bickered over their very different interpretations of the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action's call for an agreement to be reached in Paris in 2015 that is \"applicable to all Parties\" (countries). The United States and other industrialized countries have insisted that this calls for an agreement with emissions reduction pledges by all countries (in particular, by the industrialized countries plus the large emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, Korea, Mexico, and South Africa).  But China, India, and most countries in the developing world have maintained that because the Durban Platform was adopted under the auspices of the UNFCCC, it calls only for emission reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.  In previous essays at this blog, I've written about the potential promise that the Durban Platform can offer for a departure from the paralysis that has characterized the past 15 years under the Kyoto Protocol with its dichotomous distinction between emissions-reductions commitments for industrialized (Annex I) countries and no such commitments for other nations.  But it is difficult to claim that the rhetoric in Bonn has been encouraging in that regard. Better News from Beijing and Washington At the same time, U.S. government officials back in Washington were quoted in the news article I read on board my flight as saying that bilateral negotiations with China -- possibly outside of the UNFCCC -- are where real progress is most likely to be made.  This caught my eye, because it may be the major -- and perhaps only -- cause for (cautious) optimism regarding the path ahead.  I wrote about this reality shortly after the UNFCCC negotiations concluded in Warsaw, Poland, in November, 2013, and recent developments merit returning to it today.  My premise is what I perceive to be the potential emerging convergence of interests between these two most important countries in the world when it comes to climate change and international policy to address it -- China and the United States.  Five factors stand out:  emissions, historical responsibility, fuel sources, policy approaches, and geopolitics. Emissions First, the annual carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of these two countries have already converged. Whereas U.S. CO2 emissions in 1990 were almost twice the level of Chinese emissions, by 2006 China had overtaken the United States.  We are the world's two largest emitters. Fuel Sources\nThird, China and the United States both have historically high reliance on coal for generating electricity.  At a time at which U.S. dependence on coal is decreasing (due to increased supplies of unconventional natural gas and hence lower gas prices ), China continues to rely on coal, but is very concerned about this, partly because of localized health impacts of particulates and other pollutants.  Importantly, both countries have very large shale gas reserves.  U.S. output (and use for electricity generation) has been increasing rapidly, bringing down CO2 emissions, whereas Chinese exploitation and output have been constrained by available infrastructure (that is, lack of pipelines, but that will change). Policy Approaches Fourth, in both countries, sub-national market-based climate policies -- in particular, cap-and-trade systems -- are moving forward.  In the case of the China, seven pilot CO2 cap-and-trade regimes at the local level are under development, while in the United States, California's ambitious AB-32 cap-and-trade system continues to make progress, and in the northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is witnessing higher allowance auction prices due to the more severe targets the RGGI states recently adopted. Geopolitics Fifth and finally, there is the reality of global geopolitics.  If the 20th century was the American Century, then many observers, including leaders in China, anticipate (or at least hope) that the 21st century will be the Chinese Century.  In this regard, I'm reminded that I was quoted by David Jolly in the New York Times, as saying, \"If it's your century, you don't obstruct, you lead.\"'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

We\u2019ve compiled nine helpful reads that outline the most common financial mistakes and tell you how to get around them. With this advice in hand, you\u2019ll be well prepared to navigate any rocky financial waters ahead. Are you worried about getting swindled out of your savings or losing everything in a crash? Alice Finn, the author of\u00a0Smart Women Love Money, explains the simple ways to avoid those catastrophes \u2014 and warns us about a threat to our earnings one never seems to consider. We sometimes cling to myths that can set us up for financial failure because of our complicated emotions surrounding money, from overexcitement to anxiety or fear. Here are some of the most persistent untruths \u2014 and tips for banishing them once and for all. With so much going on with work and life, it\u2019s easy to focus on the here-and-now and put aside your bigger financial goals. However, this will leave you scrambling later in life. Think of this article as a map to help you bypass those monetary gaffes. You know that going to your doctor for regular checkups is important for your physical health, but have you run tests lately on your financial health? You don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re having money troubles to seek help. In fact, there may be things you\u2019re doing now that seem like no big deal but could seriously derail your finances. Lenders look at your credit score, also known as your FICO score, to gauge how likely you are to pay back the money they lend you for a mortgage, auto loan or credit card.\u00a0Credit scores range from 300 on the low end to 850 on the high end. A \u201cgood\u201d credit score is generally considered something in the low 700s or above. Once you get down below 600, it\u2019s hard to get anyone to lend to you at all. The best thing to do with your 401(k) is set it and forget it. Here\u2019s what you need to know to make that possible. The balance in your 401(k) can be a tempting source of cash when times are tough and you have no other options. And, yes, it\u2019s possible to take an early distribution without having to pay it back, depending on your personal situation and your specific plan. But possible doesn\u2019t necessarily mean practical in terms of your financial future. How each partner feels about finances is often shaped by their experiences with money growing up. And knowing what that history is can give you a greater understanding of your significant other\u2019s attitudes toward money \u2014 and help clue you in to sore spots. It doesn\u2019t matter what you think you deserve; it doesn\u2019t matter what you think you need; it doesn\u2019t matter what you think is the bare bones to fit in with your friends or neighbors. If you don\u2019t have the money, then you can\u2019t incur the responsibilities, the debt and the obligation.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The timing of Trump\u2019s decision was remarkable. Two months ago, Trump signed into law the bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which holds websites accountable for any sex-trafficking-related content posted by users. Its backers pitched it as a way to combat human trafficking. But like the Mann Act, FOSTA targets some of the people it ostensibly aims to protect: It has already shuttered many of the websites that voluntary sex workers \u2014 those who are not trafficked \u2014 used to screen clients and keep themselves safe.  Although drafted and signed more than a century apart,\u00a0both laws are part of the United States\u2019 long history of citing human trafficking as a pretext to crack down on consensual but taboo sex. The Mann Act, also known as the White-Slave Traffic Act, was enacted in response to public hysteria about sensational yet unconfirmed reports of white women being kidnapped and trafficked by foreign men.  \u201cThere\u2019s a huge range of things that [the act] allowed the government to punish and control,\u201d Alexandra Levy, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, told HuffPost. \u201cIt gave tremendous leverage to punish interracial marriage, polygamy and promiscuity.\u201d  Throughout the first half of the 20th century, thousands of people were prosecuted under the act. Johnson\u2019s conviction\u00a0in 1912 was a prime example of the broad power of a law pitched as a way to stop what was at the time called white slavery. His crime was, essentially, being black and driving across state lines with a white woman,\u00a0even though she went voluntarily and was his girlfriend.  Seven years after the Mann Act passed, federal officials instituted the American Plan to protect U.S.\u00a0servicemen from acquiring sexually transmitted diseases before they took off to fight in World War I. The initiative allowed for the detention of women suspected of having a venereal disease. It was celebrated across the political spectrum for keeping American troops safe and for \u201ccuring\u201d thousands of women of sexually transmitted infections \u2015 though those \u201ccures\u201d often meant arsenic- and mercury-based medicines and involuntary sterilization.  Just like the Mann Act, the plan took aim at some of the most vulnerable,\u00a0like Nina McCall, a young poor white woman from Michigan who was arrested in 1918 under suspicion of being a prostitute. After her arrest, she was forcefully examined and medicated,\u00a0then detained in a federal medical institution for three months. In Michigan alone, more than a thousand women\u00a0were detained under the plan by 1918.  The Mann Act and the American Plan were swift responses to changes in American culture and the seemingly sudden rights and privileges granted women, said Scott W. Stern, who recently published\u00a0a book about the McCall case.  \u201cIn the early and late 1910s, women were getting the vote in various states, women were beginning to get formally educated, women were joining political parties, and premarital sex was skyrocketing, as was divorce,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth the Mann Act and the American Plan were really about controlling women, and especially working-class and nonwhite women at a time when women were becoming \u2018uncontrollable.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Mann Act today is most famous because of the prosecutions of certain very prominent men, like Charlie Chaplin, Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson,\u201d Stern continued. \u201cCertainly those are notable cases, but what I think far too few people know is that the Mann Act was used to lock up huge amounts of women and police their lives.\u201d \u00a0 The first people arrested by officers of the Investigation Bureau \u2014 the Justice Department agency that would later become the FBI \u2014 for violating the Mann Act were a madam and five sex workers traveling together from Michigan to Chicago, Stern noted.  So while the Mann Act and the American Plan were ostensibly aimed at saving vulnerable women, in practice the initiatives allowed the Justice Department to control them, their sexuality, and the men they associated with \u2015 many of whom were black or\u00a0Chinese.  Measures like the Mann Act and the American Plan set the stage for legislation like FOSTA.  The law aimed to curb human trafficking by holding websites and social platforms accountable for hosting content related to the sex trade. But much like the Mann Act and the American Plan, it polices members of already marginalized communities.  The new regulations pushed sites like Craigslist and Backpage to scrub their platforms of not only sex-trafficking-related content but sex-related content in general. That meant that not just sex traffickers\u00a0but also voluntary sex workers and people who engage in online sexual activities were forced further underground.  Melissa, a Phoenix-based escort, told HuffPost\u00a0that FOSTA forced her back onto the streets. Lexi, a Florida-based escort, said she couldn\u2019t screen her clients anymore without access to the sites.  Sex workers are often already members of marginalized communities, lacking easy access to banking and health care and safety from sexual or physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s an important parallel,\u201d Levy said.  The Mann Act and FOSTA used similar tactics to pass with overwhelming majorities. The Mann Act was passed unanimously, Stern said. The House and Senate versions of FOSTA passed almost unanimously.\u00a0 The Mann Act was written in response to accounts of enslavement of white women. Similarly, FOSTA used hysterical anti-trafficking rhetoric \u2014 often provided by evangelical Christian organizations that oppose all sex work \u2014 to garner support from the public. \u201cThe public is so easily manipulated when you say \u2018trafficking,\u2019\u201d Levy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotionally provocative issue. You can sort of leverage that term.\u201d In both cases, the public was galvanized by terrifying (and misleading) anecdotes of sex-trafficked children or white women, only for the legislation to be used against marginalized people after it was signed into law.  Trump\u2019s decision to pardon Johnson shows progress. But Johnson\u2019s story also offers an important lesson, Levy argued. \u201cIt should call our attention to the fact that laws that purport to be anti-trafficking can mask very serious social agendas,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully we can learn from this.\u201d '}.

Junior forward Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points.\u00a0Charles Matthews\u00a0and\u00a0Duncan Robinson\u00a0were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each. Rob Gray, Houston\u2019s leading scorer, filled up the box score with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but needed 22 shots to get there. Davis put in a productive 35 minutes, logging 17 points and seven rebounds that will be of little solace after he missed those final free throws. Michigan will move on to face the winner of Sunday\u2019s matchup between North Carolina and Texas A&M. The Wolverines will depend on the stifling defense that led them to the Big Ten tournament title and through the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, but will likely need more from their offense to advance to the next round. But Saturday\u2019s not a night for Michigan to contemplate what\u2019s next. It\u2019s a night for celebration.

With the federal minimum wage remaining just $7.25 per hour, more and more states have opted to implement their own, higher rates that local employers must observe. Many of the bumps slated for New Year\u2019s Day come courtesy of recent ballot initiatives approved by voters or bills passed by statehouses, in red and blue states alike. Some of those states have laws requiring that the minimum wage is adjusted each year according to an inflation index, to rise with the cost of living. So several of the raises amount to less than a quarter an hour. But other states that recently enacted new laws will have more significant increases. Maine\u2019s will move a full dollar, to $10. Hawaii\u2019s will rise 85 cents, to $10.10. And Colorado\u2019s will increase 90 cents, to $10.20. Here are the states with new minimum wages, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that tracks minimum wage legislation: The institute estimates that the raises will impact 4.5 million workers. (For a map of the increases, go here.) The federal minimum wage hasn\u2019t budged in more than eight years and prevails in any state that doesn\u2019t mandate a higher one. The last hike, in 2009, was the result of a series of increases signed into law by President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama stumped for a minimum wage hike throughout his second term, but Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic proposals from coming up for a vote.  Minimum wage bumps tend to be popular with the general public, with support often crossing partisan lines. A HuffPost YouGov poll last year found that more than half of all Americans thought a minimum wage raise would be good for workers, while only a third thought it would be a bad idea. The backing was greatest \u2015 and most bipartisan \u2015 for a modest hike to $10.10, as opposed to a bolder raise to $15. Buoyed by that support, labor unions and low-wage workers have succeeded in getting raises passed on the state and local levels as the federal rate has stayed stagnant. Voters have approved minimum wage referendums even in more conservative states like Nebraska and South Dakota. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia now require a higher minimum wage than the federal one. Dozens of cities and counties have also raised their minimum wages beyond the state and federal levels. In some cases, the hikes have gone as high as $15 per hour \u2015 the stated goal of the Fight for $15 campaign, the union-backed movement that began with striking fast-food workers in 2012 but soon spread to other low-wage industries.  All that success by activists has prompted a backlash from Republican state lawmakers seeking to rein in minimum wage hikes. More than two dozen states now have \u201cpreemption\u201d laws on their books that block localities from implementing their own raises. Many of these laws were passed in just the last few years to thwart campaigns by workers and unions.  Just this year, Republicans in Missouri passed a preemption law to retroactively kill a minimum wage hike enacted by city leaders in St. Louis. Under the new law, no locality could have a wage floor higher than the one mandated by the state. As HuffPost reported in July, the new law had the effect of reversing\u00a0St. Louis\u2019 minimum wage, taking it from $10 to the current state level of $7.70. '}.

In 2013, my co-founder and I started goPuff, an on-demand delivery service application. Despite the impression our company has made in the on-demand industry since then, we are reminded every day of how fragile success truly is. While we just recently secured our Series B round of funding, our team maintains the philosophy that disruption, at its inception, is not about reinventing the wheel -- it's about making it work better.  The innovation, the glitz, and the internet-shattering ideas will follow, but only if you've uncovered a real problem and offered a real solution first. Here are some tips for disrupting your own business: Understand the cultural climate. Get this: cereal sales have continued to decline\u00a0since you enjoyed it while watching Saturday morning cartoons when you were six years old. Why? Because all you have to accomplish between waking up and going to sleep leaves no time left over to sit down for a bowl of Frosted Flakes, much less the patience to clean the bowl and put it away. Our fast-paced, time-sensitive work culture has forced cereal companies to adopt grab-and-go formats such as cereal bars and pre-packaged single-serving cereal bowls, meaning that how we consume today has evolved as much as our habits have.  Try creating a catalyst (read: product or service) that will impact and improve the consumer's life as it is affected by shifting cultural norms. At my company, we've\u00a0cultivated loyalty by presenting our customers with the opportunity to be loyal -- we strive to give them what they want, when they want it, every single time. If you focus on an experience that customers can count on to work with and for their lifestyle, you'll create more than just a service for them.  Understand the competition. Prior to launching our company, we believed\u00a0delivery as usual was not cutting it. The only thing that separates on-demand delivery services from what they were, and what they are today, is the product the user orders. This is why you should try to disrupt your business model:\u00a0After all, we know that while a product may be innovative, a service is disruptive.\u00a0\n The solution is to not only look at what your competition isn't doing, but also at what they are doing. Then, work against it. We try to root our idea of loyalty in our consistency: We guarantee customers that their convenience store items will arrive by a certain amount of time for a small flat fee.\u00a0Your business model should discourage users from looking to competitors for comparable service.\u00a0If you get it right the first time, you'll have that customer's business every time.\u00a0 Understand the customer. In a world ruled by technology, everyone is a customer. What unites us all, especially Millennials and Gen-Zers, is that because we are so inundated by choice, we are skeptical consumers. We want to try what's new and trendy, but usually by recommendation, and only if it's sustainable and efficient on a long-term basis.  Listen to your users: You've created a new experience. Now, how can you make it better? We've built a business model that helps suss out customer demand. For example, when our customers ask us to bring our service to their city, expand product variety, lower prices, and make delivery times faster, we listen. This provides us not only operational leverage, but also interpersonal leverage. For your business, you could also try running exclusive contests and promotions for your customers\u00a0and creating unique partnerships with their favorite brands and companies. When you control the entire customer experience from A to Z, you are constantly evolving from within. There's a difference between disrupting your industry and disrupting yourself. If you're starting a business for the fancy title, stick to the former. But if you want to make real change, touch lives and really shake things up, lead your revolution through the latter.

It is demeaning to human dignity, subject to abuse, and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend. But there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil, preferable to the risks of suicide, violence, jail or homelessness. My first experiences in psychiatry occurred fifty years ago, at a time when 650,000 patients were warehoused in psychiatric hospitals, accurately described as 'snake pits'. I very much admired Tom Szasz for calling this out and fighting to free patients from their bondage. Some of my own earliest writings were directed against psychiatric paternalism- emphasizing instead the great value of eliciting patient preferences and of negotiating, rather than dictating, their treatment plans. And, in many years of emergency room work, my instinct was almost always on the side of taking reasonable risks- letting most people go when they insisted, rather than playing it safe by forcing them into a hospital stay. But there are exceptions- people with severe and chronic mental illness who are an ongoing, clear, and present danger to self, family, and/or the public, but who lack the insight or volition to get the help needed to reduce what is otherwise an unacceptable risk. How do we achieve an equitable balance between the sometimes competing values of freedom and safety? Involuntary commitment to inpatient psychiatric hospitals has become very uncommon in the US because almost all  psychiatric hospitals have been closed (90%, comprising 600,000 beds in the last 50 years). Completely not coincidentally, the concomitant failure to provide adequate community treatment and housing has resulted in an equivalent 600,000 people with severe mental illness being housed in jails or left homeless on the street. This neglect has made the United States for many people the worst place in the world to have a severe mental illness.  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201512/worlds-best-and-worst-places-be-mentally-ill Forty-six states have adopted Assisted  Outpatient Treatment (AOT) statutes in an attempt both to improve the lives of the severely ill and also to reduce risk among those who are at highest risk if their severe mental illness goes untreated. Court-ordered treatment is applied only rarely and only for people who meet strict legal criteria of risk and lack of insight. I write about this issue now in response to a recent paper by Barnes and Badre: 'Is the Evidence Strong Enough to Warrant Long-Term Antipsychotic Use in Compulsory Outpatient Treatment?'\nhttp://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201500408 These authors argue against the use of involuntary medication in AOT programs, because the existing literature is insufficient to prove longterm efficacy beyond one year. Drs Barnes and Badre have confused two non-related issues: the risk/benefit of long-term antipsychotic use with its use in short term AOT programs. The duration of court mandated outpatient treatment is generally brief. In 22 states, initial AOT orders are limited to 90 days or less; in 15 others, they are limited to 180 days or less; and even with renewals, 35 states allow orders of up to  no more than one year. In the state of New York, 45% of orders are not renewed at the end of 6 months.  Only 39% remain in the program for more than one year and  only 25% for more than 30 months.\nhttp://bi.omh.ny.gov/aot/statistics?p=court-order-renewals Most people in AOT convert successfully to voluntary treatment within a year. Many who were unhappy when originally ordered into outpatient care, later feel grateful once they have been helped by it. Studies show that AOT improves symptoms and functioning and reduces\nhospitalizations, arrests, and violence.\nhttp://dhmh.maryland.gov/bhd/Documents/Morrissey_OPC_Final_Report_%20110413(1).pdf The Barnes/Badre argument about the lack of literature supporting long term antipsychotic treatment doesn't apply to most people who are in AOT only on a short term basis. It has more relevence to the 25% or so of cases in which court mandated outpatient treatment is extended for a longer period of time. Because it is impossible to extend placebo controlled studies for indefinite periods, we will probably never have conclusive evidence on long term risks vs benefits of antipsychotic meds. But shorter term, randomized clinical trials show unequivocally that antipsychotic medicine dramatically reduces relapse rates during the first year after an episode. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/setting-the-record-straig_23_b_9243828.html For people with a history of severe, persistent, and dangerous relapses, the real risks of antipsychotic medicine are often outweighed by the substantial benefit. Protecting individual freedom is a great social good. But protecting personal and public safety is an equally compelling social good. It is no gift to a psychotic individual to protect his freedom to refuse much needed treatment if the immediate consequence is his harming himself or others, or winding up in jail for a nuissance crime, or being left derilict and homeless. Court mandated treatment is usually short, its benefits are often long. AOT laws provide legal recognition and protection of the patient's right to refuse treatment,  but stipulate that this right is not absolute. Mandated treatment is permitted for specified, usually brief, periods only when the patients judgment is severely and manifestly impaired and when his refusing treatment will lead to terrible consequences. The risks of illness must be very great and must clearly exceed the very considerable risks posed by antipsychotic meds. Unfortunately, enforced treatment has become a polarizing issue that is often discussed in ideological terms, as if there is a universal right answer. In my experience, people who seem to differ in theory agree much more in practice when discussing the specifics of any given situation. Eleanor Longden of Hearing Voices and I have had very different experiences of psychiatry, but agree completely on a common sense approach that places the highest value on free decision making, except in the very most extreme circumstances when such freedom may lead to disaster.  \nhttp://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/when-is-it-justified-to-f_b_4038218.html Allen Frances is a professor emeritus at Duke University and was the chairman of the DSM-IV task force.'}.

The test flight occurred on June 28, according to The Verge, which received an exclusive interview\u00a0with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to celebrate the occasion. \u201cWe ended up flying the Aquila for more than 90 minutes \u2015 three times longer than originally planned,\u201d Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s global head of engineering and infrastructure, wrote in a blog post announcing the news. The Aquila travels under 80 miles an hour, conserving energy and allowing it to \"stay aloft for months at a time.\u201d Its wingspan is larger than a Boeing 737. Facebook has long discussed using drones as part of its Internet.org service, which would provide connectivity to parts of the world that don\u2019t have it. About 60 percent\u00a0of the global population isn\u2019t online. Zuckerberg has described internet access as a human right. \u201cIn every society, there are certain basic services that are so important for people\u2019s wellbeing that we expect everyone to be able to access them freely,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in an op-ed last year. But experts aren\u2019t so sure Facebook\u2019s approach is correct. One of the ideas behind Internet.org is to provide a considerably slimmed down version of the internet called \u201cFree Basics,\u201d which allows people to access \u201cnews, employment, health, education and local information.\u201d By offering a customized internet, Facebook flouts the tenets of net neutrality, some warn. Writing for the Electronic Frontier Foundation last year, David Bogado and Katitza Rodriguez explained some of those problems: Millions of people worldwide\u00a0have no way to access the internet, and it is an urgent problem to solve in the near future.\u00a0However, one of Internet.org\u2019s proposals\u2014the zero rating proposal\u2014means that people with\u00a0fewer economic resources will have free access only to certain portions of the\u00a0internet. That portion will be decided between those large corporations that are part of Internet.org. To add to the confusion, the governments involved are promoting this segmentation of the Net as a public policy objective. Internet.org users will be cut off from the \u201cocean\u201d of the Internet that the rest of the world inhabits, where the whole internet is available for use without any discrimination or\u00a0prioritization of certain applications. In its article about the drone, The Verge gestured toward some of the questions Facebook will have to answer, asking,\u00a0\u201cWho builds the infrastructure? Who pays for the data? And then there\u2019s the question that dogs all of the company\u2019s connectivity initiatives: to what extent is Facebook providing internet access, and to what extent is it simply providing access to Facebook?\u201d\u00a0But it opted not to ask Zuckerberg to explain his stance on any of these issues. As for why Facebook might care about getting more people online \u2015 beyond offering \u201clife-changing opportunities and experiences to all of us,\u201d of course \u2015 the company makes several billion dollars every quarter\u00a0from online advertising.

Kennedy Meeks led the effort for the Tar Heels, playing perhaps the best game of his career, with 25 points and 14 rebounds. Justin Jackson was also effective for UNC scoring 22 points and connecting on four three-pointers. Tyler Dorsey led Oregon with 21 points, his eighth straight post-season game with over 20 points. North Carolina won the game despite off games offensively from Joel Berry II (2-of-14), Isaiah Hicks (1-of-12) and Theo Pinson (2-of-8). Pinson made his impact on the defensive end, using his length to bottle up Oregon\u2019s Dillon Brooks. Brooks, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, didn\u2019t have his best tournament and was bothered by Pinson\u2019s length. Brooks never could get it going, shooting 2-of-11 from the field in scoring 10 points and fouled out with 1:32 remaining. In the final minute, Oregon trailed 77-71 when Dorsey hit a three-pointer with 45 seconds left to cut the lead the three. After a Pinson miss with 18 seconds left, Keith Smith scored on a lay-up to cut the Tar Heel lead to 77-76. That set the stage for two missed free throws by Meeks. Then after another foul, Berry missed his two charity shots before Meeks pulled down his eighth offensive board of the night to seal the game for the Tar Heels. Both teams had trouble getting into their offense in the first half until Oregon, helped by two three-pointers from Dylan Ennis (18 points) ran out to a 30-22 lead. North Carolina came back from there, taking a 39-36 halftime lead. They extended their run at the start of the second half and brought their lead to eight points (46-38) on a three-pointer from Jackson. It was a 26-8 run by the Tar Heels which put them in control of the game until the Ducks made their late surge. Oregon was surprisingly loose with the ball in the first half, committing 12 turnovers, with four from Brooks. They ended the contest with 16 turnovers against only seven assists, usually a recipe for disaster. But they fought hard defensively and Jordan Bell did his job on the boards (16 rebounds and 13 points). While the Ducks couldn\u2019t grab those last second rebounds they battled the bigger Tar Heels evenly off the glass (43 rebounds each) although the Tar Heels had a +5 edge on the offensive glass. Oregon also shot poorly from distance (7-of-26) and stayed in the game at the foul line (25-of-28) with Dorsey making all 12 of his attempts. At the end, the game could have gone either way. A team needs a little luck and key plays to win close games and advance in the tournament. Oregon got that in wins against Rhode Island and Michigan but couldn\u2019t pull it off against North Carolina. The Tar Heels advance to play Gonzaga, each a No. 1 seed, in a highly anticipated championship game on Monday night. In the first game, Nigel Williams-Goss scored 23 points and added six assists and five rebounds to lead Gonzaga (37-1) to a hard-fought 77-73 win over a gritty South Carolina (26-11) squad. 7-0 freshman Zach Collins may have been the key for the Zags, contributing 14 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots in 23 minutes off the bench. 6-6 sophomore guard PJ Dozier led the Gamecocks with 17 points and added nine rebounds. Gonzaga came out shooting very well, hitting 5-of-9 first half three-pointers and 58 percent from the field in moving out to a 45-36 halftime lead. SEC Player of the Year Sindarius Thornwell was off in the half only shooting 1-of-5. The Gamecocks extended their defense in the second half and were more aggressive on the boards. Gonzaga had a 14-point lead with 10:55 remaining when South Carolina came storming back, scoring the next 16 points to take a 67-65 lead. Collins answered with a three-pointer and Przemek Karnowski (13 points) followed with a dunk and lay-up to give Gonzaga a 72-67 lead that they would not relinquish. South Carolina had chances to tie the game in the final two minutes but Rakym Felder missed a jumper with 1:37 remaining and Dozier came up empty on a three-pointer with 1:12 left. French freshman, 6-10 Killian Tillie hit two free throws, his only points of the game, with two seconds left to give the Zags their four-point winning margin. Helped by Collins\u2019 strong board work Gonzaga ended the game with a +5 rebounding margin. South Carolina cut that margin in the second half as Chris Silva (13 points) finished with 13 rebounds. Thornwell (15 points) shot an inefficient 4-of-12. Gonzaga hit just under 50 percent (29-of-60) for the game while hitting 9-of-19 three-pointers. Gonzaga advances to the championship game for the first time in program history. This article was written by Carl Berman, Managing Partner of NetScouts Basketball.'}.

Internet videos of the behavior attest to its commonality \u2014 and to the fact that so many dog lovers find it so entertaining. Once you realize how your dog reacts to, for example, a question \u2014 \u201cWho\u2019s the best girl?\u201d \u2014 it's hard to resist repeating it over and over, just to see your already-adorable dog up the cute factor by cocking her head to the side. It's like she's puzzling out the precise meaning of your words. Or is she? What\u2019s really happening when your dog tilts her head? The Better to Hear You With The head tilt, although not fully understood, might actually signify your dog\u2019s attempt to make sense of what she hears. Dr. Meredith Stepita, a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists now practicing at East Bay Veterinary Specialists in Walnut Creek, Calif., explains that some experts believe that dogs tilt their heads when they think there is a possibility that what is being said could lead to something important to the dog \u2014 an activity they enjoy, for example. Since dogs can understand some human language, including words and tone of voice, a head-cocking dog could be concentrating on picking out a key word or inflection that relates to that favorite activity. So your dog may cock her head when you start talking about taking her for a walk or giving her a bath or playing a game of fetch \u2014 whatever it is that she loves to do. Dr. Stepita notes that the way dogs hear plays a part as well. Dogs have movable earflaps that help them locate the source of a sound. In addition to moving their ears, says Dr. Stepita, dogs' brains \u201ccompute extremely small time differences between the sound reaching each ear. Even the slightest change in the dog\u2019s head position relative to the sound supplies information the dog\u2019s brain uses to figure out the distance of the sound.\u201d So, when a dog cocks her head, she could be trying to more accurately determine the exact location of a sound, specifically the height relative to the ears, adds Dr. Stepita. Put these elements together and it seems pretty likely that dogs naturally engage in this behavior and then repeat it when reinforced. \u201cIf the dog is praised by the owner for cocking her head, she will be more likely to cock her head in the future,\u201d says Dr. Stepita. Is Head-Tilting a Sign of Intelligence? Or Something Else? So is your head-tilting dog smarter than her canine peers? Although there are anecdotal reports of dogs with long, floppy ears being more likely to cock their heads in response to noises than dogs with erect ears, Dr. Stepita knows of no studies that associate the head cock with any specific classification of dog like breed, age or intelligence. She also notes that some experts have reported that dogs with certain socialization problems are less likely to engage in the head tilt when people speak. While it\u2019s easy to assume something as cute as your dog tilting her head at you is always benign, it is important to speak with your veterinarian about any behavior that could have a medical cause, including a head tilt. \u201cA dog that consistently or even intermittently holds their head to the side, especially without an obvious external trigger present (i.e., a noise), may have a medical problem,\u201d says Dr. Stepita, These types of health issues range from brain disease such as infection, inflammation, cancer, etc, to an ear problem such as infection, lodged foreign object or other mass. Only a veterinarian can rule these out.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The allies are hoping to replicate what is already happening in Philadelphia, where new District Attorney Larry Krasner (D) is reshaping the city\u2019s criminal justice system with the goal of ending mass incarceration. Billionaire George Soros, who backed Krasner\u2019s election in 2017 with a $1.45 million donation, is investing in other district attorney races across the nation this cycle. The American Civil Liberties Union, which received grant funding from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations in 2014 to support criminal justice reform, is planning voter education and outreach programs in as many as 10 states. And political action committees like Real Justice and Color of Change are directly intervening in key races. Soros, the ACLU, the two PACs and a constellation of allied state-level groups hope that by organizing activists, educating voters and dumping money into district attorney races across the country, they can slowly start to replace more of the country\u2019s 2,400 top prosecutors with reformers like Krasner. They also aim to change the way the public views elections for district attorneys, who are some of the most powerful people in the criminal justice system. The groups have targeted races in about a dozen counties that collectively contain around 5 percent of the U.S. population.  Real Justice endorsed Krasner in the Philadelphia DA election last year. The group works to elect reform-minded prosecutors around the nation and is hoping to be deeply involved in about 15 races in 2018, activist and writer Shaun King, the group\u2019s co-founder, told HuffPost last week. This year, Real Justice has raised about $1 million in funding, according to the Federal Election Commission; King said he expects the group to use every dollar and staff member it has in those 15 races. Real Justice has already announced endorsements for six district attorney candidates \u2014 four in California and two in Texas. The political action committee arm of Color of Change, the longtime civil rights advocacy group, has raised about $2 million, according to the FEC, and has announced endorsements for three district attorney candidates. \u00a0 One of the reformers\u2019 favored candidates has already lost. Both Real Justice and Color of Change backed Judge Elizabeth Frizell, who was running for district attorney in Dallas County, Texas. She came in second in the county\u2019s Democratic primary in March, and has since filed a lawsuit alleging that\u00a0voter fraud cost her the win. But Tuesday night, two black, reform-minded candidates in North Carolina \u2015 former criminal defense attorney Satana Deberry in Durham County and former Assistant District Attorney Faris Dixon in Pitt County, both of whom are backed by Color of Change \u2015\u00a0won their Democratic primary elections.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to send a message. We\u2019re starting to get phone calls from DAs around the country asking us about our demands. We\u2019re getting calls from candidates,\u201d said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change\u2019s nonprofit civil rights organization and spokesman for the group\u2019s political action committee arm. \u201cAnd as an organization that couldn\u2019t get DAs to return our calls, this is the power of actually being engaged in the democracy this way.\u201d The political action committee expects to be involved in five to seven more races in various states this election cycle, Robinson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to come,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cPart of our work is building the kind of long-term cultural power and conversation around this office so that DAs know that, all over the country, people are watching, and that communities have the power to turn out and kick them out if they aren\u2019t serving them. It\u2019s also an opportunity for DAs who do want to do the right thing, want to be reform-minded, to actually be on the right side of history.\u201d Real Justice selects candidates to support based on a questionnaire. The first question uses a five-page guidance memo Krasner distributed to his office in February as a litmus test. It asks the candidates to list the policies from that memo they would not implement during their first 100 days in office. The dozens of other questions ask for the candidates\u2019 stances on mass incarceration, the drug war, the death penalty, police accountability and corruption. Color of Change has six national demands it expects district attorneys to support \u2014 end money bail, stop putting children in adult jails and prisons, stop unnecessary prosecutions of low-level offenses, stop anti-immigrant prosecutions, hold police accountable and practice transparency about their offices. But the groups have ambitions far beyond simply endorsing candidates. They want to educate and change minds. Color of Change is doing voter outreach in local communities, telling people about the role a district attorney plays and the records and campaign platforms of various candidates \u2015 all in an effort to get black voters to turn out in DA elections.\u00a0Real Justice, meanwhile, is in the process of building out regional volunteer teams in all 2,400 districts that elect their top prosecutors. Building that new system out will take a big chunk of this year, King said. \u201cUltimately, what we\u2019re trying to do is have a massive educational effort so people know that the DA is really, really important,\u201d King said. \u201cThe role of prosecutors is really important. We have to say it over and over again.\u201d King sees reform of local prosecutor offices as integral to the broader criminal justice reform movement. \u201cWe often think of bad cops, horrible incidents of police brutality, but at the heart of all of it is 2,400 district attorneys,\u201d King said. \u201cMost local people can\u2019t describe their DA or its functions. It\u2019s a system that operates in the shadows. And they have sweeping powers to run the local justice system.\u201d King is right: Prosecutors are among the most powerful government agents in the American criminal justice system. They have complete and unrivaled access to the evidence that can determine a person\u2019s guilt or innocence. They have broad powers over how seriously to take a charge against an individual and how aggressively they are willing to pursue a case. They can cut deals with witnesses, co-conspirators and defendants, and they can pile on charges to produce sentences to strong-arm someone into taking a plea deal. Prosecutors determine the charges a defendant will ultimately face and set the parameters for the eventual punishment a person might receive. America\u2019s elected prosecutors do not reflect the diversity of the jurisdictions they serve. Ninety-five percent of elected prosecutors are white, and 79 percent are male. Only 1 percent of prosecutors are women of color. And the majority of prosecutors \u2014 85 percent \u2014 run for election unopposed. Prosecutors are also rarely punished for misconduct. The cases that have led to disbarment, or even criminal charges, are few and far between. And in the end, they are largely shielded from any liability that might result from their actions thanks to a Supreme Court ruling granting them absolute immunity from civil suits. Progressives\u2019 efforts in 2018 prosecutorial elections could represent a turning point, said Miriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a group that works with more than a dozen recently elected reform-minded prosecutors to help them accomplish the goals they campaigned on. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this election season closely because we know that this group of new elected DAs with a different vision for the justice system is likely to expand in number,\u201d Krinsky said. \u201cWe know in the past that most DAs are not just re-elected, they often have no opposition at all \u2015 so there\u2019s not even an airing of critical issues for the public,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s changing. Given the enormously influential role of prosecutors in controlling the front door to the justice system, this degree of scrutiny is helpful, healthy and necessary.\u201d HuffPost is committed to covering the role of elected prosecutors in America\u2019s criminal justice system.

The suit signals a continued conservative interest in changing the way the census counts immigrants.\u00a0In a statement, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the plaintiffs in the suit, said apportionment should exclude immigrants\u00a0and be based on only the citizen population. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) have made similar calls. Missouri lawmakers are considering legislation to base their state legislative districts based only on citizen population. Last week the top official in the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division said the Trump administration had \u201cno position\u201d on whether districts should be apportioned based solely on citizen population. Every 10 years, the census counts all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, and that tally is used as the basis to figure out how many congressional seats each state gets. The\u00a014th Amendment says congressional seats should be apportioned based on simply the number of \u201cpersons.\u201d But in a suit filed Tuesday in federal court in Alabama, Brooks and the state\u2019s Attorney General Steve Marshall (R) argue that in the 18th and 19th centuries, the word \u201cpersons\u201d would not have been understood to include undocumented people in the country. They argue that including undocumented immigrants in the count to determine congressional representation unfairly allows states with large undocumented populations to have inflated political representation. Alabama is projected to lose a congressional seat after the next census. In March the Commerce Department announced it would add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census \u2015 the first time it will do so on a decennial survey since 1950. Civil rights groups say including the question will drive down response rates among immigrant groups.\u00a0 The results of the census have significant consequences; in addition to determining how many House seats each state gets, the count determines how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated. The suit seeks to block a census rule\u00a0directing the bureau to count citizens and foreign nationals in the United States at the address where they live or sleep most of the time. The plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the 14th Amendment \u201cby robbing the people of the state of Alabama of their rightful share of political representation while systematically redistributing political powers to states with high numbers of illegal aliens and their citizens.\u201d Legal experts and historians cast doubt on the lawsuit\u2019s foundational claim \u2015 that the word \u201cpersons\u201d\u00a0was previously understood to exclude undocumented immigrants. Franita Tolson, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a scholar of the 14th Amendment, said she was \u201cunaware of any historical support\u201d for Alabama\u2019s argument. She said the legislative history surrounding the 14th Amendment shows that those who passed it understood the word \u201cpersons\u201d to apply to those ineligible at the time to become citizens.\u00a0 \u201cTo say that Alabama\u2019s argument is a stretch is being overly generous,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe text says \u2018persons\u2019 and the history illustrates that this term applies broadly.\u201d Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, noted that the founders added a clause to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution to prevent slaves from being counted as people for the purpose of determining how many congressional seats each state gets. If the Founding Fathers had intended to exclude people illegally in the United States, he said, they could have added a clause to explicitly say so.  Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, pointed to information on the website of United States Customs and Immigration Services noting that immigration in the 18th and 19th centuries was \u201crelatively free and open.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 1875 that the U.S. Supreme Court said the federal government had a responsibility to regulate immigration, and it wasn\u2019t until 1880 that Congress began to enact immigration legislation. \u201cAt the time of the Founding, there simply wasn\u2019t a category of \u2018undocumented\u2019 immigrants,\u201d she wrote in an email. John Thompson, a former director of the Census Bureau, noted that there is no good way for the census to determine whether people are in the country legally. Census officials, he said, can\u2019t simply walk up to people and ask them if they are legally in the United States and expect to get an accurate count. The suit offers no method for the Census Bureau to count legal immigrants but exclude unauthorized residents. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Marshall, dismissed the practical concerns. \u201cIt is important to know who is here both legally and illegally. Our lawsuit is only focused on the question of counting illegal immigrants in the apportionment portion of the census,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere are a variety of proposals that would allow the census to identify immigrants without legal status. \u00a0We will address the appropriate remedy in the course of the litigation.\u201d Jeffrey Wice, a Washington lawyer who has worked with Democrats on redistricting issues, said the case could go to the Supreme Court. He added that it was \u201cfiction\u201d that the Founding Fathers intended to exclude undocumented people from the census.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWhoever filed the suit did not think this through,\u201d he said.'}.

Having regained control to put down sixth seed Marin Cilic 6-2 6-7(5) 6-3 3-6 6-1 under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena, Federer promptly lost it at the end of his victory speech. \u201cAnd my team, I love you guys.

Tuesday\u2019s report can be seen on HBO\u2019s Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel, 10 p.m. ET. The segment is reported by David Scott and titled Soccer\u2019s Darkest Secret. The case began with a former Premier League player, Andy Woodward, saying that during his six years in the British youth development system he was repeatedly raped by his coach, Barry Bennell.  Making the situation more shocking to British fans, this happened at Crewe Alexandra, one of the most respected and successful youth development teams in the country. Bennell himself commanded similar respect. He had previously worked at Premier League powerhouse teams Chelsea and Manchester City.  At Crewe Alexandra he forged relationships with the boys\u2019 families, telling them that their sons would develop more rapidly if they spent weekends at Bennell\u2019s house. He just didn\u2019t specify the kind of development he had in mind. Woodward, talking with Scott, says he endured the abuse and kept quiet because he was warned that if he said anything, he would lose playing time and his career prospects would nosedive.  Woodward\u2019s decision to finally talk, decades later, opened an unexpected floodgate. More than 500 former youth players have come forward with similar stories, and hundreds of coaches and organizations are under investigation.  One of those who has now spoken out, Gary Johnson, achieved his childhood dream of playing for Chelsea, one of the Premier League\u2019s elite franchises. He now calls that a hollow victory, because he was \u201cshattered\u201d inside by years of sexual abuse from chief scout Eddie Heath at Chelsea\u2019s youth program.  Heath often orchestrated multi-player sexual encounters, says Johnson, and no one spoke out for the same reason Woodward kept quiet: They were afraid it would kill their career prospects in the insanely competitive youth leagues.  It all sounds like a superversion of sexual scandals in U.S. sports programs, and it was appropriately shocking news in Britain, where football rules as the national sport and obsession. It has been headline news since Woodward stepped forward.  Viewers in the U.S. may be equally interested, if not surprised, when Soccer\u2019s Darkest Secret notes two further disturbing aspects of the story.  Both involve the potential culpability of the organizations that were in the business of supervising the teams where this abuse took place.  Scott talks with an identity-protected former employee of Crewe Alexandra who says that in 2001 he went to the Football Association (FA), Britain\u2019s ruling soccer authority, and warned about a potential pedophilia scandal.  In return, he received a one-sentence reply telling him the FA had investigated and \u201cthere is no case to answer.\u201d The FA also subsequently terminated a study on child protection before it was concluded, citing \u201cbudget cuts.\u201d  Since Woodward came forward, the FA has suspended several coaches suspected of pedophilia. But the former Crewe employee says he suspects both the team and the FA are still trying to minimize the damaging scandal.  He notes that the official who apparently refused to seriously investigate Bennell \u2014 now a convicted serial child sex abuser \u2014 today is chairman of Crewe Alexandra. While the focus of Darkest Secret remains on the sexual abuse itself, and how something this widespread could have continued for years, it also notes the subsequent impact on the victims\u2019 lives.  Alcoholism, depression, bad relationships and suicide attempts seem to have been troublingly if unsurprisingly frequent.  \u201cAt no point has anyone on that football club spoken out,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cNot even we\u2019re sorry for what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d          \u02e0\ufffd?'}.

In a\u00a0study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, scientists at the National Institutes of Health describe the cases of a 9-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman with rare neuromuscular symptoms. Both patients seem to lack proprioception \u2015 that is, an awareness of the position of one\u2019s body in space. When blindfolded, they couldn\u2019t walk or keep their balance. They also couldn\u2019t track the position of their arms and legs without seeing them. To understand how naturally this comes to most people, just close your eyes and bring your finger to your nose. Easy, right? Being drunk can temporarily take away your ability to do this. But if the two people in the study closed their eyes and tried to touch their noses, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it at all. The researchers discovered that the patients had mutations on a gene called PIEZO2, suggesting that this gene contributes to the sense of touch and proprioception. \u201cOur study highlights the critical importance of PIEZO2 and the senses it controls in our daily lives,\u201d Dr. Carsten B\u00f6nnemann, an NIH researcher, said in a statement. \u201cUnderstanding its role in these senses may provide clues to a variety of neurological disorders.\u201d The patients were examined by B\u00f6nnemann, who specializes in studying unknown genetic illnesses in children. The woman and the girl both had similar difficulties with walking, coordination and body growth and development.\u00a0Their symptoms included bent fingers and feet and curved spines. The woman and the girl could each sense pain and temperature, but certain other kinds of touch went almost ignored by their nervous systems. One patient who underwent brain imaging showed no neural activity in response to someone brushing on her palm. She also reported that a gentle brush on her forearm, which feels comforting to most people, felt \u201cprickly\u201d to her.  It turned out B\u00f6nnemann and his colleague had zeroed in on a specific gene that was already being investigated in mice at another lab at the NIH. So the two teams of researchers joined up.\u00a0 The mutation in the gene appears to block the production of a protein by the same name. This protein is believed to be mechanosensitive \u2015 which is to say it generates nerve signals in response to the mechanical force of touch on the skin, allowing us to sense the touch. \u201cAs someone who studies Piezo2 in mice, working with these patients was humbling,\u201d Alexander Chesler, researcher at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and a co-author of the study, said in the press statement. \u201cOur results suggest [these patients]\u00a0are touch-blind,\u201d Chesler said. \u201cThe patient\u2019s version of Piezo2 may not work, so their neurons cannot detect touch or limb movements.\u201d The woman and the girl appear to compensate for a lack of a sense of touch and proprioception by relying on vision and other senses, the researchers said.  The researchers suspect the PIEZO2 gene may also be related to skeletal growth and development.

Government officials and top climate scientists will meet in  Berlin from April 7-12 to review the 29-page draft that also  estimates the needed shift to low-carbon energies would cost  between two and six percent of world output by 2050. It says nations will have to impose drastic curbs on their  still rising greenhouse gas emissions to keep a promise made by  almost 200 countries in 2010 to limit global warming to less  than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial  times. Temperatures have already risen by about 0.8 C (1.4F) since  1900 and are set to breach the 2 C ceiling on current trends in  coming decades, U.N. reports show. \"The window is shutting very rapidly on the 2 degrees  target,\" said Johan Rockstrom, head of the Stockholm Resilience  Centre, and an expert on risks to the planet from heatwaves,  floods, droughts and rising seas. \"The debate is drifting to 'maybe we can adapt to 2 degrees,  maybe 3 or even 4',\" Rockstrom, who was not among authors of the  draft, told Reuters. Such rises would sharply raise risks to food and water  supplies and could trigger irreversible damage, such as a  meltdown of Greenland's ice, according to U.N. reports. The draft, seen by Reuters, outlines ways to cut emissions  and boost low-carbon energy, which includes renewables such as  wind, hydro- and solar power, nuclear power and \"clean\" fossil  fuels, whose carbon emissions are captured and buried. It said such low-carbon sources accounted for 17 percent of  the world's total energy supplies in 2010 and their share would  have to triple - to 51 percent - or quadruple by 2050, according  to most scenarios reviewed. That would displace high polluting fossil fuels as the  world's main energy source by mid-century.                 CARBON CAPTURE Saskatchewan Power in Canada will open a $1.35  billion coal-fired electricity generating plant this year that  will extract a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from its  exhaust gases - the first carbon capture and storage plant of  its type. Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), the group meeting in Berlin, will help governments,  which aim to agree a deal to slow climate change at a Paris  summit in December 2015. Few nations have outlined plans  consistent with staying below 2 degrees C. Another report by the IPCC last week in Japan showed warming  already affects every continent and would damage food and water  supplies and slow economic growth. It may already be having  irreversible impacts on the Arctic and coral reefs. The new draft shows that getting on track to meet the 2C  goal would mean limiting greenhouse gas emissions to between 30  and 50 billion tonnes in 2030, a radical shift after a surge to  49 billion tonnes in 2010 from 38 billion in 1990. The shift would educe economic output by between 2-6 percent  by 2050, because of the costs of building a cleaner energy  system based on low-carbon energies that are more expensive than  abundant coal, the IPCC said. Capturing carbon dioxide is also  expensive, it added. China and the United States are the top emitters. One option is to let temperatures overshoot the 2C target  while developing technology to cool the planet by  extracting  greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, the draft says. The draft  that would add to risks of warming and push up costs. Extracting carbon from nature includes simple measures such  as planting more trees, which soak up carbon as they grow, or  capturing and burying greenhouse gases from  electricity-generating plants that burn wood or other plant  matter. A problem is that markets for trading carbon dioxide focus  on cuts in emissions at power plants and factories burning   fossil fuels, not renewable energies which are viewed as green. \"In Europe there is no incentive\" said Jonas Helseth,  director of environmental group Bellona Europe who chairs a  group of scientists and industry experts looking at burying  emissions from renewable energy. The IPCC draft report is the third and final study in a U.N.  series about climate change, updating findings from 2007, after  the Japan report about the impacts and one in September in  Sweden about climate science. The September report raised the probability that human  actions, led by the use of fossil fuels, are the main cause of  climate change since 1950 to at least 95 percent from 90. But  opinion polls show voters are unpersuaded, with many believing  that natural variations are the main cause.     (Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Andrew Heavens)'}.

Now, Google wants to fill empty calendar space with the activities you\u2019d like to do at some point but never seem to have time for. The company on Wednesday rolled out Goals, a new feature for the Google Calendar app that lets you schedule activities, like jogging or spending time with your kids, during the hours when you have nothing going on. The feature\u00a0uses machine learning to organize your life in a way that helps you better meet your personal objectives, according to Google. Say, for example, you want to go jogging more often. Tell your Google Calendar how much you want to run per week, and the app will find space in your schedule to fit that in. Just select your goals from a dropdown menu, or enter custom activities you'd like to work on, and the program will ask a few questions -- what time of day is best for that activity, how often do you want to do it and for how long. An algorithm then scans your calendar for open slots and fills them with the things you say you\u2019d like to do more of. Users can mark each goal as completed or not, which helps the algorithm improve scheduling in the future. The algorithm automatically reschedules activities if conflicts come up.

It sweeps up information about web searches, location and emails to alter search results and serve personalized advertisements.\u00a0While a person's Google account does store their calendar information, it doesn't use that information to personalize ads.

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the practice of  injecting water, sand and chemicals underground to crack rock  formations and free up oil and natural gas. The technology makes  it possible for oil companies to unlock California's vast  Monterey Shale deposit, estimated to hold 15.4 billion barrels  of recoverable oil. But environmentalists across the nation have decried the  practice, saying that the chemicals used in the process pollute  underground water supplies and cause other damage. New York has  instituted a moratorium on fracking, and Illinois Governor Pat  Quinn signed a strict set of regulations into law in June. The California law would require oil companies to obtain  permits for fracking as well as acidizing, the use of  hydrofluoric acid and other chemicals to dissolve shale rock. It would also require notification of neighbors, public  disclosure of the chemicals used, as well as groundwater and air  quality monitoring and an independent scientific study. The hotly contested bill drew strong opposition from many  environmentalists, who said it did not go far enough and  complained that a proposed moratorium was taken out, along with  some tougher regulations. In his signing statement, Brown, who favors some level of  fracking in the Monterey Shale, said he believed more changes  would be necessary even as the law goes into effect next year. \"The bill needs some clarifying amendments, and I will work  with the author in making those changes next year,\" Brown said.  He did not specify what changes he wanted to make. State Senator Fran Pavely, a Democrat who represents the Los  Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills and was the author of the new  law, said the regulations would stop oil companies from fracking  in the state without full disclosure of their methods. \"Oil companies will not be allowed to frack or acidize in  California unless they test the groundwater, notify neighbors  and list each and every chemical on the Internet,\" Pavely said.  \"This is a first step toward greater transparency,  accountability and protection of the public and the  environment.\" Opposing the measure along with the environmentalists was  the oil industry, which said the new law could make it difficult  for California to reap the benefits offered by development of  the Monterey Shale, including thousands of new jobs, increased  tax revenue, and higher incomes for residents. The law \"could create conditions that will make it difficult  to continue to provide a reliable supply of domestic petroleum  energy for California,\" said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of  the Western State Petroleum Association, which represents oil  companies in California. The law will go into effect Jan. 1, 2014.     (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Additional reporting by Rory  Carroll; Editing by Cynthia Johnston and Eric Beech)'}.

In the course of a decade and a half as a photojournalist, I\u2019ve met hundreds of thousands of animals. Some were only in passing and others I\u2019ve gotten to know over many years. I\u2019ve encountered animals who endure and have endured unimaginable pain and suffering, and others fortunate enough to be cared for by loving and dedicated human companions. I\u2019ve been into the heart of industrial farming facilities and medical testing labs that have been constructed to wring as much profit for as little expenditure\u2014of effort, tenderness or money\u2014from the animals whose lives begin and end there. But I\u2019ve also found refuge with people and organizations who bring devotion, affection and resources to nurture and heal those who were broken and discarded. I\u2019ve seen complete indifference and heartrending compassion, misguided ignorance and deliberate torture. I\u2019ve found myself in a world of bars and metal and stench and despair, and a world of space and earth and fresh air and hope.  We Animals and the project of the same name that birthed it are my attempts to honour the remarkable individuals, both human and nonhuman, whom I\u2019ve met along the way. This book, a sampling of a hundred photographs from the thousands I\u2019ve taken for the project, is my addition to the library of works that educate people about the extent and intensity of the ongoing war human beings are waging against our animal kin. It endeavours to break down the mental and physical barriers we\u2019ve built that allow us to treat our fellow creatures as objects and not as sentient beings.  What you see on these pages may surprise or disturb you. My aim is not to turn you away but to draw you in, bring you closer, make you a participant. I want my photographs to be beautiful and evocative as well as truthful and compelling. I hope you\u2019ll take the time not just not just to look but to see \u2014 if only as a mark of respect for the billions of animals whose lives and deaths we don\u2019t notice. To look at this book is to bear witness with me, which means also that we confront cruelty and our complicity in it. As a species we have to learn new behaviours and attitudes and unlearn the old ones.  I\u2019ve always loved animals. When I was a child, my parents allowed me to keep budgerigars. I couldn\u2019t stand them being in a cage, so when I was at home I was allowed to let them fly around the bathroom and I\u2019d sit on the counter and watch. To this day, my rescued budgies fly wherever they want in my home office. When I was eight or nine years old, I used to walk the neighbours\u2019 dog, a Shepherd/Rottweiler mix named Duke who lived in their backyard; ten years later I became a volunteer dog walker at the Ottawa Humane Society. As I grew older, I began to notice that what was amusing or entertaining to most people\u2014animals being taught to beg and perform tricks, for instance\u2014seemed merely sad to me, a poor reflection on us and our inability to see these creatures as autonomous beings. Yet I continued to eat meat, visit zoos, and use animals in the ways that most of us do.  My passion for animals was matched by an intense interest in photographs. My father owned a Minolta camera with a fifty-millimetre lens, with which he took the majority of our family photographs. I\u2019d pore over and memorize our albums of summer holidays and Christmastime, and when I entered my teens, I \u201cborrowed\u201d his Minolta. This fascination with photographs became a passion for photography. As an undergraduate at the University of Ottawa, I had the opportunity to take Photography 101 as an elective. The moment I saw my black-and white images emerge from the pool of chemicals under the red lights of the dark room, I knew that I wanted to make this kind of magic for the rest of my life. I finished my degree (in English and Geography), but did all I could to pursue my interest in photography. I found mentors, took on internships, assisted other photographers, and spent every available minute I could in the dark room. '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

And people are already saying, \u201c\u2018This is why you shouldn\u2019t hire women,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Sandberg writes. \u201cActually, this is why you should,\u201d\u00a0she continues. Hiring, mentoring and promoting women is the only long-term solution to sexual harassment, which is all about power, according to Sandberg. In her post, she also outlines some basic guidelines that companies should follow if they\u2019re serious about preventing harassment at work. The solution certainly isn\u2019t the so-called Pence rule \u2015 the vice president reportedly will not dine alone with another woman unless his wife is present \u2015 as some have suggested. Instead, Sandberg writes, men should strive to treat colleagues and employees equally. If you won\u2019t dine or drink alone with a woman, then you shouldn\u2019t do it with a man either. \u201cDoing right by women in the workplace does not just mean treating them with respect. It also means not isolating or ignoring them,\u201d\u00a0Sandberg writes. \u201cAnd it means making access equal. Whether that means you take all your direct reports out to dinner or none of them, the key is to give men and women equal opportunities to succeed.\u201d Lean In, which was almost an instant manifesto for corporate feminism when it came out in 2013, is looking a little rusty these days.\u00a0In the book, Sandberg urged women to be more ambitious in the workplace. The recent flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations make it clear that ambition and leaning in aren\u2019t enough. Women who are sexually harassed are more likely to quit their jobs and leave their industries, not gun for that next promotion,\u00a0research\u00a0has shown. In her post, Sandberg doesn\u2019t address this problem head-on,\u00a0although she does point out that\u00a0Lean In\u00a0brought up the issue of men not giving women opportunities because of fear they might be accused of harassment. \u201cI wrote in Lean In that 64 percent of managers are afraid to be alone with a woman colleague, in part because of fears of being accused of sexual harassment,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe problem with this is that mentoring almost always occurs in one-on-one settings. One of the most gratifying responses I got from Lean In was when senior men acknowledged that they had been giving fewer opportunities to women, often without really thinking about it. I got call after call where CEOs and some of the most senior men in many industries told me, \u2018I never really thought about it before \u2015 but you are right that I take men on the trip and to the dinner rather than women and that is unfair.\u2019\u201d Perhaps then it is men who need to do some leaning in. Instead of succumbing to fear over sexual politics, they should be taking the leap and helping women advance at work.\u00a0That\u2019s the key to ultimately solving the problem of men abusing power,\u00a0Sandberg writes. \u201cUltimately, the thing that will bring the most to change our culture is the one I\u2019ve been writing and talking about for a long time: having more women with more power,\u201d she writes. Along her way up, Sandberg says she had her share of experiences with more powerful men who tried to take advantage \u2015 a hand on the leg, career advice that had to be given late at night and alone. But now Sandberg is one of the most powerful female executives in the world \u2015 at the top of a multibillion-dollar company, with 2 billion users, which likely even played a role in deciding the U.S. presidential election.\u00a0 Harassment happens to her very rarely now, she writes. \u201cOnly ever with men who in that moment, feel that they have more power than I do.\u201d'}.

A forthcoming paper in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal analyzes the fall in traffic, arguing that it provides the most direct evidence to date of a so-called \u201cchilling effect,\u201d or negative impact on legal conduct, from the intelligence practices disclosed by fugitive former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Author Jonathon Penney, a fellow at the University of Toronto\u2019s interdisciplinary Citizen Lab, examined monthly views of Wikipedia articles on 48 topics identified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as subjects that they track on social media, including Al Qaeda, dirty bombs and jihad. In the 16 months prior to the first major Snowden stories in June 2013, the articles drew a variable but an increasing audience, with a low point of about 2.2 million per month rising to 3.0 million just before disclosures of the NSA's Internet spying programs. Views of the sensitive pages rapidly fell back to 2.2 million a month in the next two months and later dipped under 2.0 million before stabilizing below 2.5 million 14 months later, Penney found. The traffic dropped even more to topics that survey respondents deemed especially privacy-sensitive. Viewership of a presumably \u201csafer\u201d group of articles about U.S. government security forces decreased much less in the same period. Penney's results, subjected to peer-review, offer a deeper dive into an issue investigated by previous researchers, including some who found a 5.0 percent drop in Google searches for sensitive terms immediately after June 2013. Other surveys have found sharply increased use of privacy-protecting Web browsers and communications tools. Penney\u2019s work may provide fodder for technology companies and others arguing for greater restraint and disclosure about intelligence-gathering. Chilling effects are notoriously difficult to document and so have limited impact on laws and court rulings. More immediately, the research could aid a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Wikipedia\u2019s nonprofit parent organization and other groups against the NSA and the Justice Department.

A variance issued last month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture is allowing organic livestock farmers in California to temporarily abandon the feeding standards that allow them to label their product as organic. Due to a lack of grass -- which livestock typically must graze on four months out of the year to be considered organic -- farmers whose grazing season includes February and March do not have to grass-feed their livestock during those months, effectively slashing organic requirements in half. During that time, \u201corganic ruminant livestock producers \u2026 are not required to graze or provide dry matter intake from pasture during this time period,\u201d the variance states. \u201cProducers may reduce their 2014 grazing season by the number of days that correspond to this time period in their grazing plan.\u201d The USDA issued the variance after receiving requests from the California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF) and Marin Organic Certified Agriculture and will only apply it to farmers operating in the 53 out of 58 counties that have been declared primary natural disaster areas, where the devastating statewide drought has left farmers without the grass that makes their product organic. \u201cIt\u2019s huge because we still don\u2019t have pasture for cows to graze on,\u201d Albert Straus of the Straus Family Creamery in Petaluma told The Guardian. \u201cWe lost at least a month to a month-and-a-half of pasture,\u201d he said, noting that the grass dried up back in December. According to the CCOF, organic producers are only allowed to substitute their livestock\u2019s grass diet with organic feed, but other advocates for pesticide-free farming warn that this is still an unfortunate reinterpretation of what it means to farm organically. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary evil,\u201d Ronnie Cummuns, national director of the Organic Consumers Association, told The Huffington Post. \u201cWe\u2019ll support this variance if that\u2019s the only alternative,\u201d he said, emphasizing that temporary exceptions like this pose a threat to organic standards if their end date isn\u2019t secured.

Researchers from the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, identified the new breed of kitty in a study published last year, but the fluffy feline may be better known by its common name: poodle cat. According to the International Cat Association, the breed's origin dates back to 1987 when a feral cat birthed a litter of five in Montana. At the time, breeders noticed that one of the kittens in the litter looked different from the others, primarily because of her thick curly hair.  As the team noted in the study, the breed arose from a spontaneous genetic mutation, which makes the curly hair a dominant trait. However, unlike related breeds Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, which are also characteristically curly but carry recessive genes, the Selkirk Rex has a significantly thicker coat due to its three layers of fur. That's why the poodle cat is also referred to as the \"cat in sheep's clothing.\" The curly-coated feline caught the eye of Persian cat breeder Jeri Newman, who decided to cultivate the line by mating the kitty with a male Persian. She christened the new breed Selkirk after her stepfather, making it the only type of cat that is named after a person, Discovery reports. As Mother Nature Network notes, the University of Veterinary Medicine only recently confirmed that the Selkirk Rex is a genetically distinct line. The International Cat Association, the American Cat Fanciers Association and Cat Fanciers' Association, on the other hand, have already accepted the cat breed.'}.

He could have\u00a0walked into a gun store, filled out a form and walked out with a weapon in less than an hour.\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t do that in\u00a0Massachusetts\u00a0because the state requires would-be buyers to get a permit\u00a0first. That means going through a much longer process and undergoing a lot more scrutiny. Each applicant must complete a four-hour gun safety course, get character references from two people, and show up at the local police department for fingerprinting and a one-on-one interview with a specially designated officer. Police must also do some work on their own, searching department records for information that wouldn\u2019t show up on the official background check.  If the police come to believe an applicant is a possible threat to public safety,\u00a0they can refuse to grant the permit. And that is what happened in the case of this man from Newton. Police records showed eight visits to his home from 2008 to 2012, each time in response to calls from family members concerned about his behavior. On one occasion, according to the police account, the man had punched a picture frame and lacerated his hand;\u00a0another time, he had been wielding a knife and threatening to commit suicide.\u00a0Officers took the man into protective custody after three of the visits, the reports said, and at nearly all of them he was intoxicated. This December, following a procedure that Massachusetts law lays out, Newton\u2019s chief filed a five-page memo with a state district court. It summarized the incident reports, one by one, and concluded that the man \u201chad exhibited or engaged in behavior that could potentially create a risk to public safety.\u201d The man, who declined to comment for this article and whose name HuffPost is not publishing,\u00a0challenged the police decision in court, as the law allows applicants to do.\u00a0A written filing stated that he has completed treatment for alcohol addiction, as a physician independently confirmed. It also said that he has a steady job and noted that there have been no incidents since 2012.\u00a0\u00a0 A district judge considered the argument and, a few weeks later, upheld the police department\u2019s decision. The man from Newton is now appealing that decision.\u00a0But whether or not he ultimately gets his permit, his story illustrates just how aggressively Massachusetts regulates gun ownership. No other state requires a permit for any kind of gun purchase while also giving police some discretion to deny those permits.\u00a0 The combination could help explain why the state\u2019s mortality rate from firearms incidents is relatively low, according to some experts who have studied these types of laws. That makes the Massachusetts permit system a potential model for legislation in other states, or even the country as a whole, at a time when the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, has put gun violence back on the political agenda. But replicating the Massachusetts program would require persuading or overcoming resistance from gun rights advocates, starting with the members of the National Rifle Association who are meeting in Dallas this weekend. They are convinced that permit systems like the one in Massachusetts do little to deter violence, while doing a lot to undermine the Second Amendment.\u00a0 Massachusetts has required that gun owners get permits since 1968, although initially the state approved permits automatically for anybody without major crime convictions or other disqualifying factors. In the parlance of gun control, it was a \u201cshall issue\u201d system rather than a \u201cmay issue\u201d system,\u00a0in which officials or law enforcement would have had leeway to deny licenses in certain circumstances.  That changed in 1998, when state lawmakers gave police broad discretion to withhold handgun licenses for people who were, in the police department\u2019s judgment, \u201cunsuitable.\u201d In 2014, following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, Massachusetts lawmakers, led by House Speaker Robert DeLeo, strengthened its gun laws yet again, expanding police discretion so that it applied to rifles and shotguns, too.\u00a0 The permit process for rifles and shotguns is slightly different than the process for handguns, but they lead to the same basic result: Today, police can deny ownership of any kind of firearm, subject to court review.\u00a0That made Massachusetts unique. The other two states with police discretion over ownership, New Jersey and New York, apply that method only to handguns.\u00a0 The 2014 law also clarified, somewhat, when and how police in Massachusetts should use their discretion. By law, the police can restrict a license or deny one outright anytime they have credible evidence that somebody may pose a threat to public safety. The \u201ccredible\u201d part is supposed to keep the police from acting arbitrarily; police actually have to file papers with a local court justifying denials. The \u201cmay\u201d part is supposed to make it clear that the police can limit or withhold a license anytime they believe a mere threat exists. They don\u2019t have to wait until they are certain or even nearly certain an applicant would use a gun for crime or self-harm. One way to think of the system is that it places the burden of proof for denying a license on the police while making it clear that the proof does not have to be overwhelming. And, although the state still does not specify exactly what constitutes a threat and what doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s precisely the sort of judgment call best left to city and town officials, supporters of the law say.  \u201cGun violence is usually local, among people who know each other,\u201d John Rosenthal, co-founder of the organization Stop Handgun Violence and a longtime advocate for tighter gun laws, said in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cWho better than the local police chief to issue renewable licenses and be able to have that discretion every six years?\u201d Many experts agree. \u201cLocal police chiefs typically know more about the people in their community than does a national computer,\u201d David Hemenway, a well-respected gun violence researcher at Harvard, told The Trace. Even with the new system in place, the vast majority of people who apply for licenses get them, according to a 2017 evaluation that a panel of experts conducted for the state\u2019s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. But 1 to 3 percent do not, depending on the year, the panel determined.  That number doesn\u2019t account for the people who don\u2019t even try to get licenses, because they know police would not grant them.\u00a0And even among those residents who get licenses, many will have restrictions on how they may use their guns. They might not have freedom to carry a firearm outside the home, for example, except for transporting it to firing ranges or hunting grounds. (This is one way in which the Massachusetts practice is more typical. Many states give the police discretion over who gets to carry a gun outside of the home.) In general, police from rural parts of Massachusetts are a lot less likely to issue restrictions than the departments in cities and surrounding suburbs, according to a compilation of 2016 statistics by Commonwealth Second Amendment, which advocates for gun rights. Police say such differentials are largely a byproduct of the very different way departments operate depending on the size and closeness of their communities. \u201cMost people we know one way or another \u2015 it\u2019s a neighbor, or a neighbor\u2019s friend or co-worker, or somebody you deal with on the job,\u201d Lu-Ann Czapala, the firearms officer in Ware, said during an interview at the city\u2019s headquarters. Ware, a former mill town in the rural area between Worcester and Springfield, has a population just shy of 10,000. \u201cVery few people who come in and apply have anything in their background that would cause a problem.\u201d That\u2019s not to say it never happens. \u201cThe ones who get our attention,\u201d Czapala said, \u201care the ones we\u2019ve had to see before, to come to their houses, with incidents that don\u2019t rise up to arrests but tell us, \u2018Hey, something is not right here. Gee, we\u2019ve been to this house so many times.\u2019\u201d And, in that respect, the process is quite similar to Newton\u2019s. The big difference is that George McMains, the lieutenant who handles firearms permits there, may have to investigate applicants \u2015 by, for example, calling neighbors or family. That\u2019s because, in a city whose population is just under 90,000, McMains is less likely than Czapala to know the applicant personally. McMains said investigating incident reports is especially important for revealing histories of domestic violence, because even repeated visits can result in no formal charges and, thus, no automatic disqualifications for gun ownership even under the unusually tight standards Massachusetts has in place.  It\u2019s not surprising he would say that. In a 2013 survey, Massachusetts police departments said incidents of domestic violence were among the most likely reasons for them to restrict or deny a license, or to suspend one they had approved.  At the same time, McMains said, police officers work hard to distinguish between \u201csomebody arrested for disorderly conduct when he was in college, on a Friday night, 15 years ago, versus somebody who has a record of being involved with domestic situations with his significant other.\u201d McMains, who has been handling Newton\u2019s permits for two years, says that is one reason every license rejection during his tenure has held up in court. \u201cThat goes to show that the chief does put a lot of thought into his denials,\u201d McMains said.  Gun homicides and suicides still happen in Massachusetts, in part because people without licenses still manage to get guns. But gun violence happens a lot less frequently than it does in most states.  Adjusted for age and population, the gun fatality rate in Massachusetts for 2016 was the lowest in the U.S.\u00a0And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been for most of the last 30 years, although sometimes another state, like Hawaii, ends up with a slightly lower rate.  Just how much that low rate has to do with the state\u2019s gun laws is a matter of ongoing debate, even among experts. Pretty much any legitimate study is going to rely on assumptions that will be open to valid criticism; separating out cause and effect can be virtually impossible. But the available research provides a good reason to think Massachusetts laws in general and the permit system in particular have made violence less likely. Some of the most widely cited work, by Daniel Webster of Johns Hopkins University, has focused on two states that have had similar, albeit weaker, permit schemes: Missouri, which got rid of its license program a decade ago, and Connecticut, which added one in the 1990s. Using a variety of methods designed to estimate what might have happened if those states hadn\u2019t changed their laws, Webster and his colleagues concluded that getting rid of gun licenses in Missouri led to more gun violence, while introducing licenses in Connecticut led to less. Additional research, including a study the Journal of Urban Health published last month, has shown that gun crimes in states with permit schemes tend to involve guns that criminals obtained more easily elsewhere.  That suggests the laws are at the very least forcing would-be perpetrators to change their behavior. It also suggests permit systems could have a bigger effect on violence if more states had them.  Police officials in Massachusetts make that argument all the time. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that some states just give out these guns with very few requirements,\u201d William Evans, commissioner of the Boston police and a champion of tighter gun laws, said in an interview.  \u201cWe have tough gun laws here, and to me it makes a difference,\u201d Evans said. \u201cBut if we had them nationally, if other states had universal background checks and strong licensing like our state does, there would be less violence.\u201d The other big question about the Massachusetts system is the constitutional one. The Supreme Court, in a controversial 2008 ruling known as D.C. v. Heller, upheld the government\u2019s ability to regulate firearm possession and usage. But it also recognized, for the first time, a constitutional right to gun ownership.  To Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League\u00a0and outspoken critic of Massachusetts regulations, the state\u2019s licensing system clearly infringes on that right. \u201cWe always have to be careful about how much authority we give to law enforcement,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cTheir jobs \u2015 God bless them \u2015 is to enforce the law, not decide on somebody\u2019s civil rights.\u201d Jason Guida, an attorney and former state firearms official who now represents people appealing license denials, has a similar view. \u201cOnce we go down the road of giving police discretion, we are not just stepping on the other side of that line, we are jumping over it and dancing.\u201d Guida represents that man from Newton who is appealing his license denial, and he thinks the case is an example of how the law gives police too much authority. When the man wrote a letter requesting the gun permit, he addressed his history with police head-on, Guida noted. The incidents all occurred during a difficult period in his life, the man wrote, and since that time he has stayed dry, gotten a steady job and even done volunteer work at a local food bank. He also promised to use the gun lawfully, saying he wanted it only for bird hunting and target practice. \u201cMost of my clients have never been convicted, never even been charged with a crime,\u00a0but a chief has decided that they are not safe with firearms,\u201d Guida said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rub right here, how Massachusetts may have gone beyond what the Second Amendment allows.\u201d Supporters of the Massachusetts law see things differently. Public safety is a constitutionally permissible reason for restricting gun ownership, they say, and local police are ideally situated to make that call, at least initially. \u201cIn the context of gun rights, where the Supreme Court has said limitations based on public safety principles are appropriate, we want law enforcement to make those decisions, because they are the ones on the ground, who see the behavior,\u201d Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center, said. There is also the appeals process, which can serve as a safeguard for constitutional rights. Although police discretion over gun ownership can be \u201cconstitutionally problematic,\u201d says Adam Winkler, a UCLA constitutional law professor, \u201cif more than 90 percent of applicants are getting permits, there is an appeals process in place and government has to provide actual evidence that\u2019s reviewed by a neutral arbiter, that seems to me a system that the courts might uphold.\u201d \u201cNo right is absolute \u2015 Heller makes that clear,\u201d Winkler, who is the author of the book Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, added. \u201cIf the question is \u2018Should there be enough discretion to target certain behaviors that fall short of criminal conviction but are highly probative of danger from firearms?\u2019 a court is likely to say that kind of review is acceptable.\u201d In Washington, a handful of lawmakers have held up the Massachusetts system as a prototype for the rest of the country. One of them is the state\u2019s junior Democratic senator, Ed Markey, who has sponsored a bill that would give states strong financial incentives to introduce their own licensing programs. \u201cThe involvement of police chiefs in the licensing process is key,\u201d Markey said at a news conference in March, when he formally unveiled the proposal. \u201cWe can\u2019t overstate that enough.\u201d Democratic lawmakers from other states with their own variations on permit systems, including Connecticut, Maryland\u00a0and New Jersey, have introduced similar measures. Those lawmakers have a lot of work to do. Gun\u00a0violence is getting more political attention than at any time since 2013, and the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings,\u00a0which not coincidentally is the last time Congress came close to passing meaningful gun legislation. And if the odds of enacting significant new measures now are long,\u00a0they will improve if supporters of tighter gun laws win more seats in Congress, starting with this year\u2019s midterm elections. But most of the focus so far has been on banning assault-style weapons or extending background checks to private sales, the two ideas that have gotten the most attention in the past. Although many experts believe these measures can also help, there\u2019s reason to think that they would work best in combination with a full-fledged permit system that involved police discretion. State lawmakers in Massachusetts appear to agree. The state already has a ban on many assault-style weapons, and it already applies its laws to all sales, not just those that licensed dealers make. That\u2019s actually one reason advocates think a permit system could win over some gun rights advocates. It spares private dealers the administrative hassle of performing background checks; all they have to do is check for the state-issued permit. Now many of the same lawmakers responsible for the 2014 law are looking to build on it. They are pushing for a \u201cred flag\u201d law\u00a0in which family members could ask judges to issue emergency restraining orders when they fear a loved one is about to commit an act of violence. These orders would automatically suspend any existing gun licenses and allow police to seize weapons. Although this would be a separate policy from the permitting system, the underlying impulse is the same: to identify people likely to hurt themselves or others and keep guns out of their hands before it happens.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 156,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The gains, however, still remain above a level that is considered sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market. October and November\u2019s data was revised to show 19,000 more jobs added than previously reported. The economy created 2.16 million jobs in 2016.\u00a0 Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0.4 percent, benefiting from a calendar quirk, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. That pushed the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, from 2.5 percent in November. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the jobs market. The employment report added to data ranging from housing to manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy from the Obama administration. Trump, who takes over from President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has pledged to increase spending on the country\u2019s aging infrastructure, cut taxes and relax regulations. These measures are expected to boost growth this year. But the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance could increase the budget deficit. That, together with faster economic growth and a labor market that is expected to hit full employment this year could raise concerns about the Fed falling behind the curve on interest rate increases. The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The Fed forecast three rate hikes this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 178,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticking up one tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent. Employment growth in 2016 averaged 180,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 per month in 2015. The slowdown in job growth is consistent with a labor market that is near full employment. There has been an increase in employers saying they cannot fill vacant positions because they cannot find qualified workers. The skills shortage has been prominent in the construction industry. Even as the labor market tightens, there still remains some slack, which is holding back wage growth. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of percentage point to 62.7 percent in December. The participation rate remains near multi-decade lows. Some of the decline reflects demographic changes. December\u2019s job gains were broad, with manufacturing payrolls rising 17,000 after declining for four straight months. Construction payrolls fell 3,000 in December after three consecutive months of increases. Retail sector employment rose 6,300 after increasing 19,500 in November. Department store giants Macy\u2019s (M.N) and Kohl\u2019s Corp (KSS.N) this week reported a drop in holiday sales. Macy\u2019s said it planned to cut 10,000 jobs beginning this year.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 98,000 jobs last month, the fewest since last May, Labor Department said on Friday. Job gains, which had exceeded 200,000 in January and February, were also held back by a slowdown in hiring at construction sites, factories and leisure and hospitality businesses, which had been boosted by unusually warm temperatures earlier in the year. In March, temperatures dropped and a storm lashed the Northeast, likely accounting for some of the stepback in hiring. The two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate from 4.7 percent in February took it to its lowest level since May 2007. \u201cThere probably was a large weather-related factor in there during the measurement week. If you look at the underlying data outside of this singular report and the way it\u2019s measured, the data still suggests that job growth is pretty good,\u201d said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose. U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. While the bigger establishment survey showed fewer jobs created last month, the smaller and more volatile survey of households showed employment increased 472,000. The labor market is expected to hit full employment this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing 180,000 last month and the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. The weak payrolls gain could raise concerns about the economy\u2019s health especially given signs that gross domestic product slowed to around a 1.0 percent annualized growth pace in the first quarter after rising at a 2.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Average hourly earnings increased 5 cents or 0.2 percent in March after rising 0.3 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.7 percent. Given rising inflation, the moderate job gains and gradual wage increases could still keep the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates again in June. The U.S. central bank lifted its overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in March and has forecast two more hikes this year. The Fed has said it would look at how to reduce its portfolio of bond holdings later this year. \u201cI think for the Fed, it doesn\u2019t change all that much in the near-term outlook. They were not going to go in May, and there are still going to be two more employment reports before the June meeting,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, held at an 11-month high of 63 percent in March. A broad measure of unemployment, that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 8.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2007, from 9.2 percent in February. The employment-to-population ratio increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 60.1 percent, the highest since February 2009. Last month, construction jobs increased 6,000, the weakest since August, after robust gains in January and February. Manufacturing employment gained 11,000 jobs, slowing from the 26,000 positions created in February. Retail payrolls fell 29,700, declining for a second straight month. Retailers including J.C.

The world\u2019s top maker of smartphones and memory chips said its April-June profit was likely 8.1 trillion won ($7 billion), better than the average forecast of 7.8 trillion won tipped by a Thomson Reuters survey of 16 analysts. It was the highest since a 8.5 trillion won profit in the first quarter of 2014. The mobile division likely was the top earner for the second straight quarter, raising the question of whether the South Korean company can sustain this strong momentum in the face of competition from Apple Inc and cheaper Chinese rivals. \u201cAt this point it appears unlikely that we\u2019ll see stronger competing devices emerging (in the second half),\u201d IBK Asset Management fund manager Kim Hyun-soo said. Apple\u2019s new iPhones - likely to launch around September - would not offer any dramatic new features, Kim said. While Samsung will not disclose detailed results until late July, its shares rose on the guidance. They were up 1.7 percent as of 0132 GMT, compared with a 1.1 percent rise for the broader market. The Thomson Reuters poll tipped the mobile division\u2019s profit to have risen 54.5 percent from a year earlier to 4.3 trillion won, the highest since the second quarter of 2014. S7 sales will likely ease in the second half, but Kim said Samsung should be able to maintain quarterly earnings of between 7 trillion won and 8 trillion won for the rest of 2016 with help from its chips business and the launch of its next premium smartphone, the Galaxy Note. Samsung\u2019s smartphone business shrank last year as Apple grabbed market share at the high end with its iPhone 6, and Chinese rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] did well in the budget segment. Things turned around this year, with the success of the Galaxy S7 and margin improvements from a more streamlined product lineup putting the business on track for its first annual profit growth in three years. Looking further ahead, some investors remain sceptical about Samsung\u2019s long-term prospects in the cut-throat smartphone segment, which has seen slowing growth globally. \u201cFor the medium term I think 4 trillion won (quarterly mobile) profit is the new normal,\u201d Nomura analyst C.W. Chung said. Samsung said revenue for the quarter likely rose 3 percent to 50 trillion won. (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) Nevada blaze, like the  Arizona fire that killed 19 firefighters last weekend, was  sparked by lightning and fueled by dry conditions, strong winds  and high temperatures, said Marty Adell, incident commander for  the federal Bureau of Land Management. Five days after it was ignited on Monday, the Nevada blaze   was still completely uncontained, Adell said, although there  were no reports of injuries or damaged buildings. The Nevada fire forced the closure of two state highways on  Friday. The night before, the Red Cross set up emergency  shelters in Las Vegas and Pahrump, a community about 55 miles  (88.5 km) to the northwest. Smoke from the blaze was visible as far away as the Las  Vegas strip. In Arizona, where residents and emergency crews alike remain  in shock over the loss of an entire elite firefighting team last  week, the 8,400-acre (3,400-hectare) Yarnell Hill fire has been  90 percent contained, officials said. The Arizona blaze also destroyed 114 buildings, many of them  homes, since it was sparked by lightning on June 28. U.S. Senator John McCain, who represents Arizona, said on   Friday that the federal government should pump more money into  clearing flammable brush in fire-prone areas, and expressed  concern that the federal automatic spending cuts would affect  wildland firefighting programs. \"We need to clear these forests and we need to make it so  that the damage done by these fires is not as catastrophic as  what we just saw, McCain said at a news conference in Prescott,  the home base of the slain firefighters. Weather forecasts called for cooler temperatures, which  should help firefighters working to fully extinguish the blaze,  about 70 miles (113 km) from Phoenix. \"We had a really good day yesterday and things are in place  ... to have good success today,\" deputy incident commander  Jerome McDonald told a news conference. Officials said most of the hundreds of area residents were  still unable to return home. McDonald said considerable work  must be done before gas and electricity service can be restored. Nineteen firefighters in a specially trained unit called the  Granite Mountain Hotshots were killed while battling the blaze.  It was the greatest loss of life from a wildfire since 1933,  when at least 25 men died in 1933 battling the Griffith Park  fire. A memorial service to honor the 19 firefighters is scheduled  for Tuesday at an arena in Prescott Valley, Arizona. U.S. Vice  President Joe Biden is expected to attend. Officials plan to set  up an overflow area to handle the crowd, expected to exceed the  arena's seating capacity of nearly 5,000. The firefighters' bodies will be taken in a procession from  the medical examiner's office in Phoenix to Prescott on Sunday,  the Prescott Fire Department said. Federal investigators are probing the reasons for the deaths  of the 19 firefighters who were overcome as they tried to battle  the fast-moving blaze on rugged terrain.

Dear Suzan,  Well, I really interpret the letter you refer to in your article [\"Censorpship & Upcoming Royal Society Evo Meeting\"] as evidence that this IS a paradigm shift. Because it focuses not on the biological theory itself, but on social matters in academia. And this is a serious hint. Because if this kind of deep change happens, then very many scientists face a problem of how to survive this change because the new dominant model they would like to accept results in many of their previous writings losing much of their value.  Nobody wants to belong to the party of losers. One of the best strategies in such a case is evidently an interpretation of the change as a gradual accumulation of knowledge while their work has always been at the cutting edge.\n [Following is the censorship email Kull refers to above -- it was not written by Denis Noble: \"Could I request that you stop referring to the forthcoming RS-BA meeting (\"New Trends in Evolutionary Biology:  Biological, Philosophical and Social Science Perspectives\"), and to the extended evolutionary synthesis, more generally, as in some way advocating a \"paradigm shift\".  Such language is both misleading (the vast majority of scientists working towards an extended synthesis do not seek revolutionary change in neo-Darwinism) and counterproductive (such talk undermines calm scientific discussion by creating an unnecessarily emotive and antagonistic atmosphere).  I view the Kuhnian model as superseded long ago:  the data suggests that sciences rarely if ever change through \"revolutions\".  Lakatos' framework of \"research programmes\" offers a more up-to-date, accurate and useful conceptualization of (gradual and progressive) scientific change.  The extended evolutionary synthesis is best regarded as an alternative research programme, entirely complementary to orthodox evolutionary biology.  Talk of \"paradigm shift\" gives the false impression that the differences amongst evolutionary biologists are far more extreme than they actually are. . . .\"] [Kalevi Kull's correspondence continues:] Is this a radical change in biology what is going on now? The contrast is quite clear, if we look at how evolutionary innovation is described. Either innovation begins from a new mutation, followed by newly behaving phenotype, which is amplified by natural selection (this is what the neo-Darwinian model suggests), or innovation begins from a change of function (with habitat choice, or resource choice, etc.) first stabilised by epigenetic or ecological inheritance and followed by fixation due to mutational noise (which is what the new model states, let us call it the post-Darwinan model).  That is: either a genetic change first, followed by functional change, or a functional (epigenetic, i.e., non-genetic) change first, followed by genetic changes.  The details of this contrast are described, for instance, in my work \"Adaptive Evolution without Natural Selection\" published in the Linnean Society journal. . . but there are many scholars who share this model. That paper provides a row of references.  Isn't it a deep contrast, and a possible move from one to another, a radical change of the major model of evolution? However, if indeed one knows all the dramatic history of the theory of evolution. . .  \nHere's a sketch. Estonia has been described as a country with one of the richest political experiences. We also see this in our history of Darwinism.  In the 19th century, Tartu University was one of the leading German-language universities, and one of the leading critics of Darwin was working at Tartu University -- Karl Ernst von Baer, the founder of developmental biology. Simultaneously, one of the very first courses in the world and best textbooks written about  Darwin's-time Darwinism was provided by a professor at the same university, Georg Seidlitz.  Around the turn of the century, before WWI, Tartu University was a Russian-language university, and Darwinism was soon popularised as supporting early socialist ideas. Soon after, together with advances in genetics, evolutionary theory was interpreted as a basis for eugenics (also used in this way by national socialists in Germany before WWII).  Then Estonia was annexed by Russia, and after the WWII for more than a decade it meant the influence of vulgar Darwinism (also called 'creative Darwinism' at that time), as propagated by Lysenko (yes, he also praised Darwin, he just did not like genetics).  In the 1970s and 80s, all students in the Soviet Union had to learn how Darwinism goes hand in hand with Marxism, meaning a good connection with the 'synthetic theory of evolution', which was a synonym for neo-Darwinism. . .  Simultaneously, a radical non-Darwinism was also developing within certain circles of Soviet biologists, who took it from the theory of Nomogenesis of Lev Berg and his follower Alexander Lyubischev. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, an outgrowth of neo-Darwinism called sociobiology became a dominant view for many, particularly among zoologists. . .   If one has read all this and been able to understand why all these scholars had the views they had, it is hardly possible to describe this history as gradual improvement of a model, continuous extension of a synthesis. There have rather been different paradigms existing and developing in parallel.  Most of the time just one of them was strongly dominant over the other. And since evolutionary theory has almost always been tied to some ideological battles, its changes were not limited by scientific discoveries. Nevertheless, we have good friends and colleagues whose views about evolution we do not share. But should we therefore be less strict in our formulations about our views? No, that would mean giving up our understanding. Good teachers wouldn't do so.  Science, deeply speaking, is the mutual help in understanding. We should help each other as friends; nobody is understanding everything. Keeping this in mind, the best way to make our thoughts clear is to use formulations that do not hide meaning. A better understanding is not always an extension of the earlier model, sometimes it is an alternative. In other words -- summarizing -- claiming that what is going on is just an ongoing extension of Darwinism would be equivalent to saying that Einsteinian physics is just an extended Newtonianism. Why not, one may describe it so.  However, the Einsteinian change became a classic example of a paradigm shift, for Kuhn. . . . I like very much your writings. Warm wishes Kalevi'}.

The robot used was a Remotec Andros Mark V-A1 The robot was used to dispatch a suspect who opened fire during a Black Lives Matter protest, killing five officers and injuring several more. The unit is supposed to be used for bomb disposal, though it was harnessed by police last week to deliver an explosive instead. While the decision kept officers out of harm\u2019s way, some wondered about\u00a0the implications of police deploying high-tech weapons without oversight.\u00a0 The Andros Mark V-A1, which is made by military tech company Northrop Grumman, contains a surveillance camera and an extendable arm with a rotatable \u201cgripper.\u201d It\u2019s controlled wirelessly and can climb up stairs.

But Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, warns that ignoring the greater implications of this technology\u2019s deployment could be disastrous. \u201cFuture such robots will have only more bells and whistles, all of which provide the affordance for a whole array of ways in which the robot can perform activities never dreamt of by the engineers, or by the purchasing agents who chose to equip the police department with them,\u201d Nourbakhsh told HuffPost via email. \u201cThis takes us to a Wild West where sophisticated machines unleash the creative potential of the users.\u201d There are ethical concerns, he added. \u201cThere are no laws, guidelines or oversight processes for killing with a bomb disposal \u2018bot,\u201d Nourbakhsh said. The robot was used by Dallas police in a different way than intended. As robots become more advanced, Nourbakhsh argued, the gap between that original design and actual function will widen, which could lead to problems. We see this everywhere in developing technology. Consider your smartphone: When you bought it, even just a couple of years ago, there may not have been an easy way to keep law enforcement from prying into your messages if you became a criminal suspect.

Visiting one of the nation's great natural wonders, monuments or historic sites doesn't have to be as involved as an epic pilgrimage to Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon. Here are a few places operated under the National Park Service that may beckon over the long weekend. 1. Yosemite National Park, Calif. If you've always wanted to see Yosemite's granite monoliths, giant sequoias and waterfalls without the crowds, now might be the time to go. Rangers have closed off entry to the northwestern corner of Yosemite as fire crews battle the Rim Fire that's been raging along the edge of the park in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. But much of the Rhode Island-sized wilderness remains open and smoke-free. Officials have shut down part of Highway 120, typically the main path to Yosemite from the San Francisco Bay Area, but visitors who can put up with the detours will likely find fewer throngs of tourists and day-trippers than usual in the park this weekend. According to local news station KFSN-TV, it's expected that 3,000 cars a day will pass through the gates this holiday instead of the nearly 5,000 that tend to turn out over Labor Day weekend. [Yellowstone and Yosemite: Two of the World's Oldest National Parks]  2. Shenandoah National Park, Va. Just a two-and-a-half hour drive southwest of Washington, D.C., Shenandoah National Park can offer a quiet and scenic respite from the Beltway for a daytrip or a weekend camping excursion. Motorists can take in spectacular views by meandering along Skyline Drive over the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains, while 500 miles (800 kilometers) of hiking trails, including the Appalachian Trail, deliver visitors to waterfalls and wooded hollows. Even if reservations at all the campgrounds are full, most of Shenandoah is open to backcountry camping with a free permit.  3. Steamtown National Historic Site, Pa. Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pa., attracts railfans year round, but Labor Day weekend is an especially good time to relive the era when locomotives reigned. Railfest 2013 will take place on Saturday and Sunday (Aug. 31 and Sept. 1.) the site of the former Scranton yards. In addition to the regular museum displays and exhibits, visitors will be able to see old-school steam locomotives, diesel trains and passenger cars. The weekend celebration also promises opportunities to experience a cramped and noisy caboose and pump a man-powered handcar that track workers would have used a century ago. There will even be round-trip rides on historic diesel locomotives to Moscow, Pa., which boasts restored, century-old passenger and freight stations. \n(Photo: National Park Service/Wikimedia) 4. Point Reyes National Seashore, Calif. This sanctuary, just an hour's drive north of San Francisco, has much more than amazing beaches; it's a great place to take in wildlife, too. Point Reyes National Seashore boasts nearly 490 different species of birds and a breeding colony of elephant seals can be spotted from an overlook near Chimney Rock. There are also around 400 tule elk roaming free in a preserve inside the park \u2014 and it's currently mating season. On Sunday, the 32nd Annual Sand Sculpture Contest at Drakes Beach will award prizes in several different categories, including sculptures that use the most recycled plastic. The nearby visitor center houses displays about the marine environment and 16th-century maritime exploration (many researchers think Sir Francis Drake landed at Point Reyes in 1579.).  5. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site, Ga. The nation just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when Martin Luther King, Jr., addressed more than 250,000 protesters in the capital and called for an end to racial discrimination. Visitors to Atlanta can see where the civil rights leader got his start. The Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site provides tours of King's birth home on a first come, first served basis. (The NPS recommends arriving early to get a spot.) A current exhibit in the visitor center's D.R.E.A.M. Gallery features historic images from a LIFE Magazine photographer who captured the civil rights movement, from Birmingham to Brooklyn. \n(Photo: National Park Service/Wikimedia Commons) Editor's note: Before planning a trip, check with the National Park Service for road closures, cancellations and event updates: http://www.nps.gov/ Copyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Their target: a lesser-known tar sands project here at home. A Canadian company named U.S Oil Sands is poised to launch the nation's first tar sands mining operation at PR Springs, not far from Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. Tapping the energy resource, supporters say, will be a boon for Utah's local economy and the country's energy security, while posing few negative consequences, given the remoteness of the operation. Opponents, however, fear real impacts on local wildlife and tourism, as well as downstream effects on already polluted air and the continually dwindling supplies of clean water upon which millions of people in the West rely. \"We don't need to do this,\" said Celeste Bradford, 10, standing at the U.S. Oil Sands site with other kids, a few picking at rocks coated in tar. She suggested that if people raised solar panels instead, \"we wouldn't have to be polluted anymore.\" \"It's amazing how smart children are and what they do realize,\" said Raphael Cordray, who brought two nieces and a nephew on the trip to PR Springs, an area already dotted with oil and gas wells and nearby experiments in another unconventional fossil fuel, oil shale. Cordray had known about Keystone XL. But when she realized that the tar sands issue was also, as she said, \"something personal to Utah,\" she took action. She now leads an activist group, Utah Tar Sands Resistance, from Salt Lake City. The Wasatch Front, the metropolitan corridor in which Salt Lake City and other populous Utah towns are located, already has some of the worst air in the country during the winter, due in part to oil refineries and the pollution-trapping topography of the mountain valley. Adding tar sands development, with its attendant diesel trucks and local refining, will exacerbate the problem, opponents argue. \"This stuff is the bottom of the barrel,\" said Cordray, noting the heavy oil requires more refining in a process that releases more pollutants into the air than that for conventional oil. \"We could catch up with China. That's not even a joke.\" While standing on an aspen-filled ridge near the mining site, she described to The Huffington Post the wild scene around her: roaming deer and wild turkeys, grazing cows and birds flying through blue skies. \"But just over the hill, you can see it,\" she said, referring to the U.S. Oil Sands' land. \"They've done a lot of clearing, and are widening the road down here.\" The mining operation has yet to begin, although the local government appears to be literally paving the way. U.S. Oil Sands has approximately 32,000 acres under lease, with initial permits to mine 213 of those acres, and the county is spending public money to widen and pave a road needed to access the company's site. \"Now is the time to get everyone to look at Canada,\" added Cordray. She said she hopes that awareness of the reported damage associated with tar sands mining in Alberta will incite further resistance in Utah, and ultimately stop U.S. Oil Sands before it gets started. \"There's no question that this is bad for air, for water, for animals,\" she said. Less than a mile away from the U.S. Oil Sands' test pits -- one previously used as a trial mine, others dug to harvest donations of gravel for the county road -- lies an abandoned tar sands experiment from the 1980s, according to Emerson Urry, editor-in-chief of EnviroNews USA. He filmed at the site as his reporter tried in vain to rescue a chipmunk stuck in tar sands.  The molasses-like substance, also known as oil sands, is a mix of bitumen oil, sand, clay and water.\u00a0The film crew documented numerous animals that succumbed to the gooey sludge leftover from the failed mine. \"We're at the infancy stage of what the potential is in the state,\" said Tim Wagner, a Utah organizer with the Sierra Club. \"If they get a hold there and get investors and make this process economically viable, it's Katy, bar the door.\" But Cameron Todd, U.S. Oil Sands' chief executive officer, expressed his confidence that as people learn more about the PR Springs operation, they will become \"less fearful.\" For one thing, he said, Utah tar sands contain 90 percent less sulfur than Albertan sands and overall carry a smaller greenhouse gas footprint.  Todd also emphasized the benefits for the state, including revenue for public education and nearly 100 jobs during construction and roughly the same number on a permanent basis for the first mine. \"There will probably be expansions,\" he said. \"The current expectation is that we will be there for a long time.\" Much of the opposition to the project stems from the fact that the West already faces critical environmental challenges that are worsening with climate change. Of particular concern is the parched Colorado River and its tributaries, which supply irrigation and drinking water to nearly 40 million Americans. The PR Springs site perches above the Colorado River watershed, noted John Weisheit of the environmental advocacy group Living Rivers. \"The Colorado doesn't have anything to give. The reservoirs are half full. If it drops another 24 percent, hydroelectricity will no longer be available,\" said Weisheit, noting that tar sands mining is extremely water-intensive. \"I can't believe this is happening. It is ludicrous.\" Weisheit suggested that the operation poses both water quantity and quality issues.\u00a0 Todd disagreed. He noted that U.S. Oil Sands would draw water from 2,000 or more feet below the surface. \"It's so deep that it doesn't conflict with any other uses in the region,\" he said. \"And it's well below recharge levels for the water table and rivers.\" That argument would be in line with U.S. clean water policy, which assumes that water deep underground will never be used and can therefore be intentionally polluted. Yet, as ProPublica reported in January, there's precedent for that to change: Mexico City now has plans to draw drinking water from a mile deep to deal with its own water woes. Tests conducted at the PR Springs site suggest there is no shallower groundwater to contaminate, according to Todd. \"Even if there were groundwater, the process is benign and wouldn't have any negative impact,\" he said. \"The only chemical involved is biodegradable and nontoxic: a solvent from citrus.\" Utah state regulators awarded the permit based in part on that assertion. But William Johnson, a professor of geology and geophysics at The University of Utah, said he remains \"skeptical\" on multiple counts. \"Fact is, the groundwater system isn't well studied. There are springs in the area -- some are intermittent, some are perennial,\" he said. U.S. Geological Survey researchers confirmed that knowledge of the hydrology around PR Springs simply doesn't yet exist. And while a citrus-based solvent may be generally innocuous on its own, Johnson explained how it could unleash compounds naturally trapped in the tar sands and make the end product toxic should it contact water. \"I'm not inherently against development of the tar sands,\" added Johnson. \"But some basic tests weren't done.\" Also, little understood is the extent of uranium contamination in the area. In the 1940s, USGS identified deposits of the radioactive heavy metal at PR Springs. Old mines, mill tailings and decades of nuclear testing have \"riddled the entire West with uranium,\" said Dr. Brian Moench, president of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. \"I'm concerned with extreme fossil fuel extraction everywhere. But in our backyard, I'm particularly concerned,\" he said. \"There are multiple layers of health impacts, especially for children.\" Kids were the focus of the camp-out at PR Springs. They learned about the region's ecology, collected water samples and even held protest signs while chanting \"Stop tar sands!\" in front of a trailer occupied by a U.S. Oil Sands worker.  Back at a company test pit, Celeste Bradford watched as another kid bent down to pick up a tar-covered rock. \"Don't touch it!\" she cautioned. \"It's gonna be really hard to get off.\"'}.

Amazon, the city\u2019s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed. As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker. That \u201chead tax\u201d formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city. Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday\u2019s action. The move by the world\u2019s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs. Following the council vote, Amazon\u2019s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago. However, he added, \u201cWe remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.\u201d Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability. The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy. The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city\u2019s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits. Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city. Supporters cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as \u201crent-burdened,\u201d meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing. The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered. Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law. She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority. On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure. \u201cBy threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,\u201d the officials wrote. The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

But which one? For Seshu Kiran, it meant defecting to the popular Android operating system from Apple\u2019s iOS. But Mark Beales went the other way. It\u2019s a little confusing, but then again, we live in confusing times. Before we get to the reasons that Kiran and Beales bailed on their platforms, let\u2019s pause for a minute to look at the mobile OS landscape. By \u201cmobile OS\u201d I mean the software that runs on your mobile phone or tablet. Apple\u2019s iOS held a 33 percent market share for last year, while Google\u2019s Android operating system claimed a commanding 59 percent share, according to Net Market Share. The year before, it was more competitive: 44 percent to Apple and 46 percent to Google. Related: Executive contacts for Google and Apple. There\u2019s a reason for the retreat of iOS, as others have found out. But to understand why, let\u2019s get back to Kiran, an engineer from Los Angeles who dumped his iPhone for an Android phone recently. Kiran, once a loyal iPhone user, says he felt continuous pressure to upgrade to the latest device. He became more uncomfortable with it as time went on, leading up to the latest iPhone, which removed the headphone jack. \u201cI heard someone in Europe was using a washing machine for 35 years without any trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of your favorite smartphone manufacturer venturing into home appliances. It would be a disaster for customers, and it is already happening in the name of \u2018smart\u2019 slapped on to any simple device.\u201d What led him to the breaking point? An upgrade of his iPhone that \u201ckilled\u201d the device. That\u2019s a common complaint, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve personally experienced. One day your iPhone photos are crisp and beautiful, but then, after what seems like a routine system upgrade, they\u2019re all blurry. Hmm, maybe it\u2019s time for a new phone? \u201cThe choice of Android came as a natural resistance for Apple demanding me to buy a new phone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen was the last time a blender needed an unsolicited purchase in the pretext of a certain upgrade?\u201d For Beales, a retired mortgage banker, the move from Android to iOS was prompted by a \u201cmust have\u201d feature: FaceTime, the popular video telephony application. \u201cWe saw how well FaceTime worked for our kids and friends, as well as seeing the greatly improved camera capability, so both my wife and I switched to Apple\u2019s iPhone,\u201d he says. \u201cThe convenience of being able to link up with our grandchildren using FaceTime can not be matched by any other service.\u201d (Interestingly, Google is trying to match the FaceTime experience with a new app called Duo. You can call a FaceTime user, too.) But his experience underscores the main reason users would want to discard their Android phone: iOS, for all its faults, remains a slicker, more intuitive interface. Leaving iOS In principle, leaving one mobile OS for another is relatively easy. The iOS to Android transfer is dead simple, handled in three easy steps that primarily involve moving most of your data to the cloud. The Android-to-iOS switch is a little more complicated \u2015 it involves seven steps that include uploading, downloading and adding codes to your new phone \u2015 but still, not terribly difficult. But in practice, the switch can be more problematic. I learned that myself when I switched systems recently. Like Kiran, I\u2019d grown tired of Apple\u2019s high-pressure upgrades and was unimpressed with the new crop of iPhones. Removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 was a step too far. I knew the tiny wireless headsets, called AirPods, wouldn\u2019t last 24 hours in my house. I have cats that play with everything. As an early adopter of Gmail and Google Docs, transferring my data wasn\u2019t a problem \u2015 it was already in the cloud. Even though I upgraded from an iPhone 6 to perhaps the best Android phone on the market, the new Google Pixel, I had some difficulty adjusting to the new operating system\u2019s look and feel. I was one of the Apple enthusiasts who lined up for the the first iPhone in 2007. This felt almost like a betrayal. And yet I knew It was time to move on. Setting up the new phone was mostly easy, with a few painful moments. I lost nearly all the Google Voice functionality (Voice is Google\u2019s cloud-based calling application) when I decided to drop my old cell phone number in favor of my Google Voice number. That\u2019s a migration quirk that will hopefully be fixed soon. I also struggled to learn where everything was in Android. System settings, phone options and apps are all handled slightly differently than on iOS. It\u2019s a little bit like learning a new dialect of your mother tongue. It\u2019s the same, but different. Although my Android phone is now my primary phone, I find myself turning to my old iPhone to catch up on news or send a message. I suspect I\u2019ll never completely leave the Apple fold \u2015 I still use a MacBook Pro for my writing \u2015 but it feels good to have more options and to have a little fluency in Android. Also, I won\u2019t feel compelled to buy the next iPhone when it\u2019s released later this year. No sir, no more 24-month upgrade cycle for me \u2015 I hope. Wherever you go, there you are Maybe Buckaroo Banzai, the video game hero, had it right, when it comes to phone operating systems. Wherever you go, there you are. And I\u2019m not alone. David Radin, a former technology columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette who now runs a scheduling app company, says his family is evenly split between iOS and Android. \u201cWhen we upgrade, we consider the switch,\u201d he says, \u201cand almost never decide to change in either direction.\u201d That\u2019s because both operating systems are really about the same, when it comes right down to it. They each have their strengths and weaknesses, but in the end, it kind of all evens out. In the end, the choice about leaving or staying may depend on what you want from the mobile OS. For example, Radin\u2019s daughter, who also uses a Pixel, likes the seamless integration with Google Photos, Google\u2019s cloud-based storage. When you take a picture with your Android phone, it can automatically upload the image to the cloud and store it there in full resolution. \u201cThat\u2019s something that iCloud \u2015 Apple\u2019s cloud-based storage system \u2015 doesn\u2019t do,\u201d he says. No kidding. I pay extra to store my photos on iCloud, and it still doesn\u2019t accommodate all of them. Long term, the solution to this mobile OS conundrum may be similar, if not identical, to the one plaguing the computer operating system \u2015 moving to a more open-source platform that runs on any device and works with any wireless network. It\u2019s something that could have been built years ago, if there had been any money in it. OS developers know it\u2019s the right direction, but they also know it won\u2019t be profitable. \u201cAs long as Apple is at the forefront of smartphone tech then a fully open source OS environment is a long way off,\u201d says Brandon Ackroyd, the head of customer insight for Tiger Mobiles, a UK-based phone comparison site. \u201cApple understands the value of owning the whole smartphone experience from hardware to software, I can\u2019t see them giving it up. Even Google is realizing the value in having their own devices with the Pixel phones, they know if they do the software and the hardware the overall user experience is so much better.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why open-source mobile OS efforts such as Moblin, Maemo, MeeGo, Sailfish and Tizen have all flopped. But there\u2019s still time. We\u2019re only a decade into the smartphone revolution, and there are probably years to go before another disruptive technology comes along to displace it. Until then, switching mobile OSs will feel a lot like trading one prison for another. It may appear like you\u2019ve broken free, but you\u2019re just on a different cell.

Before we take lethal aim at these relatively defenseless and innocent animals, there's good cause for a reality-check, because the reality is: There's simply no good reason to hunt these wolves. Protected since 1973 under the Endangered Species Act, Michigan wolves were delisted at the start of 2012. By the end of that year, Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation declaring them fair game for hunting. Why? Because...  Because.... Well, that's a tough question to answer. Yes, there are now more than 650 wolves in Michigan. But charges that wolves have ventured onto residential porches or daycare centers -- or are killing livestock frequently -- are not passing the truth test. In some cases, entire stories about wolf incidents are being retracted. What is true: Michigan farmers, ranchers and other landowners are already permitted to kill wolves to protect livestock or dogs, even though cases of wolves killing livestock are relatively rare. Ranchers are also compensated for livestock losses from wolves. There has also never been a single record of a wolf attack on a human in Michigan. In fact, wolves are fearful of people, and avoid them. (Rightfully so.) What's more, in other Great Lakes states, wolves are often trapped inhumanely, sometimes with steel-jawed traps in which animals can suffer for days before being killed. This leaves only one motive: killing wolves merely for sport, thrill, out of hatred, and for trophies -- which is what brought wolves to the brink of extinction in the first place. Some Michigan politicians, hell-bent on opening trophy hunting season, will take any legislative or regulatory means necessary to allow the killing of wolves -- even if it means going against the will of their own citizens. Michigan residents have fought to protect wolves through referendums, yet influential pro-hunting groups have found new ways to thwart the public's voice. And it's time once again to put up a fight to protect their lives.  In March, 2013, more than a quarter of a million Michigan citizens signed a petition calling for a referendum to undo the call to arms and protect the wolves, as well as to postpone wolf-hunting season until after the 2014 election.  Unmoved, the Michigan legislature gave the unelected Natural Resources Commission (NRC) the authority to determine which animals can be hunted. Being a regulatory body, the NRC's decisions are not reversible by public vote. With its new power, the NRC approved the wolf hunt in July. To preserve these animals' lives, the Michigan public needs to overturn two critical laws in November: PA 520, the law which put wolves on the list of \"game species\"; and PA 21, which grants the NRC the authority to add animals to that list. These two laws both have the same deadly effect: to kill wolves. Rejecting these measures will effectively stop the senseless hunting and trapping of wolves, and ensure that important issues about Michigan wildlife will still be influenced by the electoral voice of Michigan voters.  The group Keep Michigan Wolves Protected is collecting signatures from registered Michigan voters to put the PA 21 referendum on the ballot alongside the one related to PA 520, so that both can be overturned and wolves can be protected. The deadline to submit signatures is March 12th. If you live and vote in Michigan, I hope you'll consider adding your name to this cause.  In the end, these wolves are not nearly the threat to humans as some of us humans are to our own humanity. Too often -- as in this case -- the truth is deliberately obscured by individuals and institutions guided solely by self-interest and profit.  When that happens, animals are not the only ones who pay the price. We all do. \u00a0\nMatthew Bershadker is President & CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA).

The pump was shiny black and the water ice-cold.  Then my father was diagnosed with leukemia, a cancer linked to chemicals used in oil and gas production. It's been nine years since I drank that water. I am from an impacted community in East Texas, home to oil and gas industry, on the southern route of the Keystone XL (KXL) tar sands pipeline. My involvement in the climate movement is motivated by the reality my community faces.   Nacogdoches, Texas lies along the southern path of KXL and cannot escape tar sands. From Cushing, Oklahoma down to Beaumont, Texas pipe is buried in the ground and scheduled to go online by the end of the year. We are waiting for the shoe to drop, for tar sands oil to flow through the pipe, for the bend of welded metal to respond to the heat and corrosion of bitumen. We are waiting for an event over which we have little control, despite its potentially disastrous impact on our lives.  Within this experience lies the insight I have to offer the climate movement. My experience is limited by the fact I am a young, white woman from an unconditionally supportive family. Incomplete as it is, however, my perspective is the best thing I can offer.  And so, I ask that the climate movement stops talking about \"winning.\"  My community will not \"win\" on climate and this idea delegitimizes the extraction industry impacts we already face. I have lived alongside the reality of petroleum extraction my whole life. A pipeline runs down our driveway. I have been woken in the middle of the night by fracking fumes that burned my eyes and nose and made me feel sick. The construction of KXL south near my home has ignited new concerns about the health and safety of my family and community. In communities like mine impacts run deep and come from all sides.  \nMaya on her family's property.   I will never \"win\" on climate. Tanks containing benzene on my family's property display plastic signs warning against cancer and requiring the use of a respirator. There are three active gas well sites within a two-minute walk from my front door. Scanning the land I am from it is impossible to imagine a scenario where I have not been exposed to the same chemicals that may have caused or contributed to my father's cancer.  Last fall the direct action campaign Tar Sands Blockade (TSB) brought national attention to my community. Folks in TSB put their lives and livelihoods on the line to stop construction and raise awareness.  I am glad they came to stand with my community but this also marked a loss. National climate groups celebrated Obama's decision to delay the northern segment of KXL, intentionally overlooking that this supposed \"win\" was paired with an endorsement to fast track the southern arm of KXL, connecting a preexisting tar sands pipeline that ended in Oklahoma to refining communities and shipping ports in Texas. There was no delay for us--pipe was being put in the ground.  In search of a \"win,\" the people of KXL south were written off as a loss.   Like cancer taking over the body, the oil and gas industry is too entangled in the organs of my community for a simple \"win-lose\" dichotomy. The industry employs us, pays for community festivals, and improves our roads. They also contaminate our water, deny us access to our land, and take away our sense of agency. Extraction industries have impacted our land, bodies, and minds in ways that can't be erased or won.   Checking a thesaurus suggests further complications of a \"winning\" framework. Synonyms to \"win\" include \"come in first\" and \"conquer.\" In communities with an intersecting history of oppression \"winning\" doesn't seem to be the most appropriate message.  Utilizing ideas of \"coming in first\" and \"conquering\" among individuals living a legacy of racism, classism, and colonialism seems intrinsically problematic.  Environmental Justice leaders ask instead that we \"lift up\" impacted communities. Will our movement be one that \"conquers\" or \"lifts up?\" Obama's decision about the northern segment of KXL is important but whatever is decided the southern segment has already marked my home. Even if KXL north is denied I will not \"win.\" Neither will people living at the end of the pipeline in Manchester or Port Arthur, or the people in Alberta, Kalamazoo, Arkansas, or countless other impacted communities.  We will not \"win.\" This doesn't mean we give up on the northern segment of KXL but it does mean that we broaden our focus to include those already facing extraction impacts.  It means that we pour our energy into stopping all tar sands--not just KXL north.  It means we stop talking about winning the northern segment of KXL and we start talking about changing the access extraction industries have to our land and our bodies.   Hope provides momentum and \"lifts up\" the individuals and ideas of a movement.  For me, however, the concept of \"winning\" doesn't offer hope but instead says my experience isn't real and KXL south doesn't matter. Working only towards a \"win\" would force me to abandon my home.  If we are to be an enduring and inclusive movement we must provide a hope that welcomes joy and acknowledges loss.  We must not ask impacted communities to abandon their homes for the cause.   There is loss and pipe buried from Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast of Texas and if we rally around a \"win\" my home will continue to be overlooked. If we only engage in \"winnable\" struggles our movement will be shortsighted, lacking compassion and leaving many behind. Instead let's dig in deep, go back for the overlooked, and be with those that will not win. Let's be a movement that looks complexity in the eye, offering a place for both hope and loss to sit together at the table and work to be a movement built on lifting others up.'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Christopher Wylie Warns Senators: Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon Want 'Culture War'', body='Cambridge Analytica\u00a0may technically no longer exist,*\u00a0but revelations about its conduct before and during the 2016 election continue to raise concerns about how social media can be used to undermine fundamental democratic processes. On Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower\u00a0Christopher Wylie\u00a0testified before the Senate judiciary committee. The wide-ranging, three-hour exchange with the company\u2019s former research director did little to allay fears. The panel also featured Mark Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Eitan Hersh, a professor at Tufts University and an expert on voter behavior and election strategies.\u00a0 Here are some of the major points of discussion: Wylie testified that Cambridge Analytica actively worked to undermine voters of color and foster political disengagement \u2015 a tactic that featured more and more heavily in conversations just before Wylie left the firm in 2014, though he says he didn\u2019t personally oversee or participate in any of those programs. According to Wylie, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s algorithms could very accurately predict race, and then go a step further by serving differentiated messages within that group. So instead of serving similar, generic messages to a large group of black people, for example, Cambridge Analytica could isolate and target specific individuals within that group who displayed certain character traits. \u201cWhen you pull a random sample of African Americans, they\u2019re all different people,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstanding their internal characteristics is a very powerful thing. You don\u2019t treat them just as a black person, you treat them as [individuals].\u201d Cambridge Analytica likely made similar efforts to suppress the votes of other communities,\u00a0Wylie said, targeting \u201canybody with characteristics that would lead them to vote for the Democratic Party.\u201d Robert Mercer is a billionaire megadonor\u00a0who supports conservative causes. The Mercer family initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the 2016 Republican primary, then shifted their support to Donald Trump in the general election. In 2013, at the urging of Steve Bannon \u2015 who would later serve as White House strategist in the Trump administration\u00a0\u2015 Mercer invested tens of millions of dollars in Cambridge Analytica to effectively create an American shell company for its British parent, SCL Group. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) posited on Wednesday that Mercer\u2019s move gave Cambridge Analytica the appearance of following U.S. election law, which prohibits foreign firms from working on U.S. elections. But Wylie testified that Cambridge Analytica nevertheless featured numerous British staffers, in violation of a 2014 memo from outside legal counsel warning it not to do so. What\u2019s more,\u00a0Mercer\u2019s funding came on the condition that Cambridge Analytica work only with Republicans. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wondered Wednesday if the \u201cinvestments\u201d may have been a deliberate attempt to circumvent campaign finance laws. \u201cWhenever Mercer invested money, it was for [research and development]\u00a0which ultimately was to the benefit of its clients \u2015 various PACs and campaigns,\u201d Wylie told Blumenthal. He added that Mercer\u2019s funds allowed Cambridge Analytica \u201cto work on projects and charge clients substantially less money for the work that was being done than it would have actually cost had the clients been paying for it themselves.\u201d After Mercer put money in, \u201cthe only restriction was that we not work with Democrats,\u201d he said. According to Wednesday\u2019s testimony, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, SCL Group, engaged yet another subsidiary, named Aggregate IQ, to bolster the Brexit campaign. Per Wylie, the campaign groups Vote Leave, BeLeave and Veterans for Britain all had contracts with the company. (Separately Wednesday, The Guardian reported\u00a0that Vote Leave and BeLeave both used the same data sets to target Facebook users, indicating a higher level of coordination than previously realized.) Wylie also says Cambridge Analytica enlisted the help of Black Cube, an Israeli private intelligence group, to conduct espionage work in Nigeria. And Cambridge Analytica has numerous ties to Russia. In 2014, Alexander Nix, Cambridge\u2019s CEO,\u00a0met with executives from Lukoil, Russia\u2019s second largest oil company,\u00a0to discuss the firm\u2019s political work in Nigeria and elsewhere. The firm was also in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange,\u00a0though Feinstein acknowledged Wednesday that \u201cthe extent of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s connection to WikiLeaks and other Russian interests\u201d isn\u2019t clear. Wylie said Cambridge Analytica also engaged with contractors who had advanced pro-Russian messages in Eastern Europe, at one point collecting data on how Americans viewed the leadership style of Russian President Vladimir Putin and what their thoughts were on issues \u201crelating to Russian expansionism.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of contact with Russian companies that made it known this research was being done,\u201d Wylie said. \u201cA lot of noise was being made to companies and individuals who were connected to the Russian government.\u201d Probably \u2015 though it\u2019s not clear to what extent. Armed with enough data points from Facebook, Wylie said, Cambridge Analytica could target people remarkably well. Based on as few as 100 of a person\u2019s Facebook \u201clikes,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can get to the same level of accuracy predicting personality traits as your spouse.\u201d Hersh, the Tufts professor,\u00a0disputed the idea that predictive capacity translates to persuasive advertising,\u00a0pointing out that political campaigns have a long history of engaging in tactics that don\u2019t work particularly well. \u201cEvery election brings exaggerated claims about the effects of the latest technologies,\u201d Hersh said,\u00a0noting it\u2019s in the interest of campaign consultants like Cambridge Analytica to embellish their role in a candidate\u2019s victory.\u00a0\u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve publicly seen about [the firm], I\u2019m skeptical its strategies were unusually effective.\u201d Sen.\u00a0John Kennedy (R-La.), however, called Hersh\u2019s argument \u201crubbish,\u201d\u00a0saying advertising can absolutely have a lasting impact when done well. \u201cI see kids walking around all the time saying \u2018Dilly dilly,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Kennedy said, referring to a popular tag line from a recent series of beer commercials. \u201cThey didn\u2019t just dream that up.\u201d Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 and was therefore unable to answer specific questions about the firm\u2019s work during the 2016 election. Instead, he repeatedly referred the senators to Bannon, who helped launch Cambridge Analytica and was reportedly deeply involved in its early efforts to collect Facebook data and use it to target and influence voters. Bannon served as Trump\u2019s chief campaign strategist during the 2016 election, then assumed a similar role in the White House until his ouster last summer. Per Wylie, Bannon was in charge when Cambridge Analytica began touting its voter suppression tactics to candidates. Bannon was also behind crafting messages like \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d\u00a0that would ultimately become focal points of the Trump campaign. \u201cThe company learned [there] were segments of the population that responded to messages like \u2018Drain the swamp,\u2019 or images of walls, or indeed paranoia about the \u2018deep state,\u2019 that weren\u2019t necessarily reflected in mainstream polling or mainstream political discourse,\u201d Wylie said, adding that Bannon \u201csaw cultural warfare as the means to create enduring change in American politics.\u201d Amid much uncertainty about Cambridge Analytica and just how much influence it wielded in 2016,\u00a0most of the experts Wednesday agreed on one thing:\u00a0Social media is bad for democracy. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a resegregation of society that\u2019s catalyzed by algorithms,\u201d Wylie said. Sites like Facebook reward informational echo chambers where partisan views are reinforced instead of challenged. \u201cInstead of a common fabric,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re tearing that fabric apart.\u201d The further people drift from the mainstream, the more they\u2019re susceptible to absurd conspiracy theories and increasingly vitriolic messaging.\u00a0 Hersh agreed. \u201cWe have a basic human response that we are attracted to provocation and extremism,\u201d he said, \u201cand online platforms are encouraging that behavior. We aren\u2019t drawn to things that are truthful. We\u2019re drawn to what we want.\u201d *Soon after Cambridge Analytica\u00a0declared bankruptcy earlier this month,\u00a0its parent company, SCL Group, opened Emerdata, a\u00a0strikingly similar firm\u00a0overseen by several former Cambridge Analytica executives.'}.

The most realistic  estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the  construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two,  and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and  100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people.\" TransCanada Corp's proposed pipeline is designed to  carry 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Canadian oil  sands and the Bakken shale in North Dakota and Montana south to  refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It would cost about $5.3  billion to build. Obama's administration is under pressure from Republicans  and business groups to approve the project because of the  economic benefits they say it will bring. Environmentalists oppose the project because of the carbon  pollution they say it would generate. Carbon emissions are  blamed for contributing to global warming. The project was first proposed in 2008 but is still making  its way through a State Department study process. The Times said Obama disputed an argument that the pipeline  would bring down gasoline prices. He said it might actually  increase prices somewhat in the U.S. Midwest, which would be  able to ship more of its oil elsewhere in the world, the paper  reported. Obama said in June the project would serve U.S. interests  only if it did not \"significantly exacerbate\" carbon pollution.

The North Carolina-based bank is among seven financial institutions that have committed to provide Remington, which filed for bankruptcy in March, with an almost $200 million lending package, reported Reuters on Sunday.\u00a0Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Regions Bank each are forking out $43.2 million in loans to help put debt-plagued Remington on \u201cstable footing,\u201d Reuters said. The gunmaker\u2019s bankruptcy exit plan was recently\u00a0approved by a Delaware judge.\u00a0 Terms of the loan agreement were drawn up in late March \u2014 a few weeks before Bank of America pledged to stop underwriting or financing businesses that manufacture military-style weapons for civilian use.\u00a0The bank said it made the promise after \u201cintense conversations\u201d with its gun-manufacturer clients \u2015 a dialogue prompted by the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cWe want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,\u201d Anne Finucane, the bank\u2019s vice chairman, told Bloomberg TV on April 11. Remington makes Bushmaster assault-style rifles. In 2012, one of them was used by a gunman to kill 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Families of the victims\u00a0sued Remington to hold the gunmaker accountable\u00a0for the damage caused by the weapon. The bank chose to abide by its loan commitment to Remington because it predated the April pledge, which was meant to kick in on a \u201cgo forward\u201d basis, a person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s thinking told HuffPost on Tuesday.\u00a0 Remington\u2019s financing plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court in March, said the person, who requested anonymity because of the bank\u2019s policy of not discussing client details.\u00a0\u201cBut it had been in the works for weeks, if not months.\u201d Bank of America could legally back out of its agreement to Remington if it wanted to, according\u00a0to New York Business Journal; it would just have to find other lenders to cover its commitment. The person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s decision pointed out that other financial institutions were reluctant to provide loans to the struggling gunmaker. Reuters reported that 30 potential lenders had refused requests to help Remington in the weeks leading up to the company\u2019s bankruptcy. Finance experts also questioned why Bank of America did not use the loan package as\u00a0leverage to push Remington\u00a0to stop manufacturing military-style guns.\u00a0 Fred Guttenberg, the father of a 14-year-old girl who died in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting,\u00a0skewered the bank on Twitter Monday for lying to the public, and encouraged people to \u201cstop doing business with them.\u201d Bank Of America lied.

In video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, Brian Schear of Huntington Beach is seen arguing with airline staff after he\u2019s asked to relinquish a seat that he says he purchased for one of his kids. \u201cI bought the seat and you need to just leave us alone,\u201d Schear says in the cellphone video.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not trying to cause a problem, but I believe in standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201d Delta has since apologized for the episode. Schear, speaking to KABC News,\u00a0said that he,\u00a0his wife and two of their three children, ages 1 and 2, were traveling on a red-eye flight from Hawaii to Los Angeles last week. They\u2019d bought the seat in question for their oldest child, 18-year-old Mason Schear, who ended up flying home a day earlier than the rest of the family. Schear put his younger son\u00a0in Mason\u2019s seat instead. Upon learning that Mason wasn\u2019t present, the airline ordered Schear to surrender the seat or be carted off to jail.\u00a0(The original report from KABC News indicates that the son is 2 years old, which is not consistent with the ages of the children as indicated in a May 3 Facebook post\u00a0from their mother.) The video appears to capture this threat, with a woman off-camera telling Schear that after he and his wife were jailed, their kids would be placed in foster care. \u201cYou have to give up the seat or you\u2019re going to jail, your wife is going to jail and they\u2019ll take your kids from you,\u201d Schear said the airline staff told him, according to KABC. \u201cWhich option do you want to take?\u201d a woman is heard telling him in the video. \u201cDo you want to get off on your own, or...?\u201d In a statement Thursday afternoon, a Delta spokesperson said the company has reached out to the Schear family \u201cto refund their travel and provide additional compensation.\u201d \u201cWe are sorry for the unfortunate experience our customers had with Delta,\u201d the statement reads in part. \u201cDelta\u2019s goal is to always work with customers in an attempt to find solutions to their travel issues. That did not happen in this case and we apologize.\u201d In the clip posted to YouTube, an employee who identifies herself as Jenna tells Schear that a 2-year-old is not allowed to occupy his or her own seat because of Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Schear disputes this claim, arguing that the boy had his own seat on their earlier flight to Hawaii and that it\u2019d be safer for him to remain in his car seat, rather than being held in his mother\u2019s arms. The FAA\u2019s website\u00a0appears to agree with Schear, recommending that children be secured in government-approved child safety restraints, and not in parents\u2019 laps. \u201cYour arms aren\u2019t capable of holding your child securely, especially during unexpected turbulence,\u201d the FAA\u2019s website says. Delta\u2019s website also advocates\u00a0for kids having their own seats. \u201cFor kids under the age of two, we recommend you purchase a seat on the aircraft and use an approved child safety seat,\u201d it states. Schear\u2019s wife, Brittany, shared the video on her Facebook page on Wednesday. After the family was made to leave the plane, she said, they did not receive a refund and \u201chad to purchase all new tickets the next day. It was the middle of the night, we had no hotel to go to or a car.\u201d The Schear family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brittany Schear posted another Facebook message late Thursday night, saying that she and Brian \u201cappreciate the love and support shown\u201d and \u201cnever imagined that our last 24 hours would be as they were.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s video comes amid a period of dire public relations for the air travel industry, following several high-profile instances of airline staff apparently mistreating customers. Most notoriously, in April, Chicago aviation officers violently removed Dr. David Dao, a Kentucky physician, from a United flight after Dao refused to relinquish his seat.

Panda Researcher Fingers Bamboo (UPDATED)', body='The panda baby born at the National Zoo in Washington just over a week ago was pink, wriggly and almost impossibly small -- about a third of a pound at its first checkup. This tiny creature's mother, Mei Xiang, weighs more than 230 pounds. Pandas are considered to be \"endangered,\" with about 1,600 in the wild and another few hundred in captivity (some estimate there are more like 3,000 pandas in the wild). Their low birth rates, males' reluctance to mate in captivity (keepers have even tried panda porn to get them in the mood) and high mortality rates (about a quarter of males and a fifth of females die in their first year, by some accounts; others put the figure higher) aren't helping.  Traditionally, baby pandas aren't even named until they are 100 days old. These creatures can face demise during their early lives in what seems like countless ways. In Washington in 2012, Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub, which died after 6 days from liver and lung problems. In Tokyo, where a 6-day-old cub died from pneumonia after its mother's milk got in its airway, officials said that 60 to 70 percent of newborn pandas die within their first week -- sometimes by being crushed by their mothers.  Here's Conservation International's description of what can befall the rare and delicate newborns: At birth, a panda cub is helpless. It takes considerable effort on the mother\u2019s part to raise it. A newborn weighs three to five ounces. Pink, hairless, and blind, the cub is 1/900th the size of its mother. Except for a marsupial (such as the kangaroo or opossum), panda babies are the smallest newborn mammals relative to their mother's size. Cubs don\u2019t open their eyes until they are six to eight weeks of age, and are immobile until three months. A cub may nurse for up to nine months before it can eat bamboo. A cub is nutritionally weaned at one year, but not socially weaned for up to two years. Infant mortality is lower in the wild than in captivity, estimated at around 40 percent. The perilous nature of being born so tiny raises one big question: Why are panda newborns so small?  Because of bamboo, said wildlife biologist Dajun Wang, who has not only studied wild pandas in China but also has a video of himself with a panda youngster in the wild on YouTube: Itty bittiness is \"definitely a result of evolution of millions of years,\" Wang recently told The Huffington Post. \"It is [a] kind of breeding strategy.\" The strategy, Wang explains, is this: Pandas subsist almost entirely on bamboo, which has very little nutrition. Grown pandas have to eat as much as 80 pounds of bamboo per day to meet their nutritional needs. \"It is easier for the animal to convert bamboo into milk than to convert bamboo into animal tissue,\" said Wang. But there are trade-offs. \"A tiny baby needs more care from its mother, for nursing, keeping warm and to avoid predators. I believe it is kind of balance.\" Then a question still remains: Why do pandas eat mostly bamboo, when, genetically, they are carnivores? (Yes, carnivores!)  And not only are they carnivorous, but according to one scientific paper,  \"Why Does the Giant Panda Eat Bamboo? A Comparative Analysis of Appetite-Reward-Related Genes among Mammals,\"  pandas even lack the gene for properly digesting bamboo. Although bamboo is their chief, though not sole, foodstuff; pandas have been found eating meat -- a phenomenon Wang researching -- as well as honey, eggs and, on their 16th birthdays, fruitsicles shaped like cars: For Tian Tian's 16 birthday, he got a fruitsicle cake shaped like a car! pic.twitter.com/5eR0H6xlP4 Scientists have found that pandas lost the gene that would allow them to enjoy the taste of meat about 4.2 million years ago, which is around the time the animals also switched over to their bamboo diet; fossil records show pandas going mostly veg somewhere between 7 and 2 million years ago. That helps answer the question of when pandas switched to their bamboo diet, but not why. \"Nobody knows how they got involved [with a] bamboo diet and how they fixed this behavior in the species,\" said Wang. \"That will be a big deal in evolution if somebody give a real answer.\" Update, Sept. 3, 8:29 a.m.: Know who's not quite so teeny tiny anymore?  The National Zoo tweeted photos of Mei Xiang's new baby over the weekend -- this cub is still incredibly small, you can see in the pics, but you can also see some important developments: The panda team saw the cub & it looks great.

Brady, the face of the NFL with his five previous Super Bowl victories, suffered his third defeat in the championship game, losing the ball on a strip sack at a crucial time in the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 41-33 victory. \u201cI expect to be back,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s 15 minutes after the game ended, so I would like to process this. I don\u2019t see why I wouldn\u2019t be back.\u201d The strip-sack play with a little over two minutes left and his team down five points overshadowed his Super Bowl record 505 yards passing. He completed 28 of 48 passes with three touchdowns and no turnovers, moving the ball so well that the Patriots never punted. For all his success, though, two failed plays will stand out in Sunday\u2019s loss. On the strip sack, he dropped back to pass and came under pressure, with Philadelphia linebacker Brandon Graham knocking the ball loose and Philadelphia\u2019s Derek Barnett recovering and advancing the ball to the Patriots\u2019s 31-yard line. That led to an Eagles field goal and an eight-point lead that held for the rest of the game. pic.twitter.com/a96UeJAQkF \u201cThose guys had a good rush and got it there and made a good play,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThey made a good play at the right time.\u201d In another rare flop, he went out as a receiver on a trick play on third down in the second quarter but could not haul in the pass from receiver Danny Amendola, which was just beyond his reach. Brady handed off to running back James White, who pitched it to Amendola on what appeared to be a reverse while Brady sneaked out into the flat, wide open. A catch would have resulted in a first down. Instead, it bounced off his outstretched hands. \u201cDanny made a good throw. I just didn\u2019t make the play,\u201d Brady said. Asked if he caught the pass in practice, he said: \u201cYeah, I caught it. Didn\u2019t catch it tonight.\u201d Dominant as the Patriots have been since Brady\u2019s first championship after the 2001 season, he said: \u201cNo one is going to feel sorry for us.\u201d Nor will they feel sorry for Brady, who is revered in New England and in 2009 married Brazilian-born model Gisele Bundchen, the mother of their two children. Brady has attributed his longevity in part to a strict diet of largely organic, plant-based foods, avoiding those he says contribute to muscle inflammation, while drinking 12 to 25 glasses of water per day, including 20 ounces (60 cl) fortified with electrolytes first thing in the morning. He says he goes to sleep at 8:30 p.m. For now, he will have the off-season to contemplate how the Patriots will return to football\u2019s center stage. \u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate like we always do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure everyone is tired after a long year.\u201d'}.

MRIs have shown that football players suffering chronic traumatic encephalopathy from\u00a0repeated concussions\u00a0and other batterings can face the same kind of brain deterioration that boxers experience. Such brain damage significantly impacts intelligence and behavior and has been linked to depression, memory loss, dementia, suicide and other early death. Fans were furious that the team and referee on the scene allowed Savage back into the game after the hit: The ref watched it, did nothing.

It shows innumerable stars and proto-stars (infant stars) along with gigantic glowing filaments and luminous clumps of gas and dust. And it all seems to go on forever. The video, released by the ESA last week, was created from observational data from the Herschel Space Observatory, a space telescope that was active from 2009 to 2013. The ESA probe spent more than 900 hours observing the Milky Way's galactic plane in five different wavelengths of light,\u00a0and then scientists spent two years processing the data to make the \"maps\" used to create the video.

Koh Dong-jin, head of the South Korean company\u2019s smartphone business, expressed regret over the recall, which will affect markets including South Korea and the United States, speaking at a news conference on Friday. Models in China feature a different battery and are not being recalled by Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest smartphone vendor. The recall comes just over two weeks after the company launched its latest premium phone, which features an outsized screen and high-resolution camera. It follows reports of the 988,900 won ($885) phone igniting while charging. Koh, who declined to comment on how many phones needed to be replaced, said Samsung had sold 2.5 million of the premium devices so far. The manufacturer plans to replace not only phones with faulty batteries sold to consumers, but also retailer inventories and units in transit. Nomura estimated that more than 1 million units have been sold to end consumers. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number,\u201d Koh said. The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, which prides itself on its manufacturing prowess. While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple Inc, the nature of the problem for the Galaxy Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung\u2019s reputation, analysts said. The company should act quickly to minimize damage to its smartphone recovery, after a string of product successes had reversed a fall in market share, they added. The phone first launched in 10 markets in North America, Asia and the Middle East. Further roll-outs have occurred since in markets like China, where sales started just this week. Its wider availability, set for coming weeks, is now on hold. While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or otherwise burning users, documented cases that lead to widespread product recalls remain relatively rare. Samsung said it was aware of 35 reports of affected Note 7 batteries. In 2007, the largest battery recall in consumer electronics history took place when Nokia, then the world\u2019s top mobile handset maker, offered to replace 46 million phone batteries produced for it by Japanese maker Matsushita Battery. Germany\u2019s biggest operator, Deutsche Telekom, said it had stopped delivering orders for the Galaxy Note 7, while French operator Orange said on its website that it had stopped pre-sales of the phone and postponed its planned sales launch - scheduled for Friday. In Britain, mobile carriers EE and Vodafone continue to accept pre-orders for the Note 7 on their sites. A Vodafone spokesman said its planned Sept. 19 sales launch could now slip, but the company was waiting for more details from Samsung to decide. U.S. operators have been taking pre-orders since early August. All major wireless carriers, including No. 1 U.S. wireless provider Verizon Communications Inc, said they had stopped selling the Galaxy Note 7. Target, a major U.S. retailer, also said it had halted sales of the Note 7. Verizon said that if a customer wants to return or exchange the Galaxy Note 7, it would waive through Sept. 30 the restocking fee it charges customers. T-Mobile US, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement it would also waive restocking and shipping charges to customers who want to return the recalled phone. Samsung has said it aimed for the Note 7 to maintain strong sales momentum in the second half of the year against stiffening competition from the likes of Apple, which is widely expected to release its latest iPhone next week. \u201cI am concerned more about a potential reduction in sales than recall costs,\u201d said analyst Jay Yoo at Korea Investment & Securities. \u201cThe recall is likely to be a blow to earnings.\u201d Samsung said new sales of the Note 7 in affected markets would resume after it deals with replacements, a process it expects will begin in about two weeks. The firm would extend refund periods for affected customers and offer exchanges for other Samsung phones, Koh said. Investors sold Samsung shares after the delay announcement on Thursday, stripping about $7 billion from the firm\u2019s market value, which remains just off recent record highs. Sentiment recovered somewhat in trading on Friday as the shares rose 0.6 percent compared with 0.3 percent in the broader market. Credit Suisse said a recall or major shipment delays could wipe 1.5 trillion won ($1.34 billion) from Samsung\u2019s 2016 operating profit estimate of 30.2 trillion won in an \u201cabsolute worst case\u201d scenario. But the brokerage said that scenario was unlikely, as it expected Samsung to resolve the problem before the fourth quarter.

In 1909, a German anatomist named Korbinian Brodmann published an intricate map of the brain\u2019s surface. He painstakingly stained brain cells of many kinds to find the anatomical features that set them apart and the rules that governed their layered organization. We now know that neurons that sense a touch on the skin are found in Brodmann area 1; those allowing you to read this article sit in area 17. Now, scientists have built an updated map of the brain that further refines those areas. Published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the map reveals 97 previously unknown areas of the brain\u2019s surface (the cortex), in addition to 83 areas that were described before. Unlike Brodmann\u2019s and other brain maps built using just one property\u00a0(how the cells looked under a microscope, for example), the new atlas is made by combining several types of data that capture multiple properties of these brain areas: their anatomy, their function and the connections between them. The data was gathered using multiple non-invasive brain imaging measures from 210 people in the NIH Human Connectome Project, and the accuracy of the resulting map was confirmed on another group of 210 people. The study authors hope that \u201cresearchers who have previously used Brodmann\u2019s map to identify brain areas will use this new map from the Human Connectome Project instead,\u201d said Matthew Glasser of Washington University in St. Louis, the study\u2019s lead author.\u00a0 According to Glasser and his colleagues at six other research centers, combining anatomical data with functional data from fMRI brain scans has allowed for more precise delineation between brain areas. For example, an area that may look indistinguishable from its neighbor under the microscope or on MRI scans may light up on fMRI scans that measure brain activation during a specific mental task and thus stand out as a distinct region. \u201cThe situation is analogous to astronomy where ground-based telescopes produced relatively blurry images of the sky before the advent of adaptive optics and space telescopes,\u201d Glasser said in a press release. Researchers hope that a more precise division of the brain can prevent potential confusion in neuroscience studies that may be looking at overly broad areas \u2015\u00a0and lead to new discoveries.\u00a0 The map is a \u201clong-awaited advance,\u201d said B. T. Thomas Yeo and Simon Eickhoff, two neuroscientists not involved in the study,\u00a0in an accompanying article in Nature. They added that it creates a reference atlas that allows neuroscientists studying various aspects of the brain to work within a common framework.

They are both at risk.  The exotic bird trade remains complex, and related statistics are staggering. The number of \"pet\" birds in the United States is estimated to be between 8 and 40 million, and is mostly exotic birds, such as parrots and cockatiels. With a parrot's average lifespan running 75 years, these birds will spend agonizing decades in captivity, and will likely outlive many of their owners.  Sunday, January 5, 2014 marks the 13th Annual National Bird Day:  a day to recognize the threats facing birds, both in captivity and in the wild. This celebration, launched in 2002 by Born Free USA in coordination with the Avian Welfare Coalition, is a reminder of the plight of our winged friends. It's a day to shine a spotlight on issues critical to the protection and survival of all birds.  The treatment of parrots -- one of the most highly sought-after exotic birds - serves as a prime example of these issues. The international parrot trade remains a major threat to global parrot populations, with roughly one-third of all parrot species in peril. Additionally, the trade causes immense suffering to thousands of individual birds who languish in captivity each day. To make matters worse, there is an inconsistent patchwork of domestic and international bird laws and regulations in place, with poor enforcement to combat bird smuggling. In Costa Rica, as in most of Latin America, the illegal wildlife trade is second only to the narcotics trade in profitability, and parrots are one of the most victimized animals. Their beauty and charisma have become their curse.  The U.S. government took decisive action more than two decades ago to dramatically curtail the import of wild birds, in an effort to reduce the pillaging of nests for these magnificent animals around the world.  The Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 effectively shifted the U.S. from being the largest importer of wild-caught birds to one of the smallest, aiding in conservation efforts worldwide. Meanwhile, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) continues to provide much-needed protection to wild bird species globally.  But, the unregulated breeding of exotic bird species in the U.S. continues to flood the market with millions of animals. Many of these birds are entrusted to humans who are ill-prepared and ill-equipped to handle the significant responsibility of their ongoing care. Overproduction and promotion of parrots and other exotic birds has resulted in an influx of unwanted, abused, and abandoned birds in shelters and rescue facilities across the U.S. Even when bred in captivity, exotic birds are not domesticated animals because their natural instincts, such as flying, flocking, and mate-bonding, remain intact. Basic components of captivity -- including isolation, lack of stimulation, and insufficient exercise -- have led many captive birds to lash out, often violently, or to continuously talk, squawk, or sing. On average, a \"pet\" bird remains in a home for only 2 years, and is then sold, passed on, or surrendered. Of the 100 or so self-identified bird rescue and rehabilitation facilities in the U.S., a significant portion have been established just in the last few years to address this need, and remain overcrowded and underfunded.  Whether birds are wild-caught or captive-bred, their welfare in captivity is frequently poor. It is very difficult to meet the needs of these intelligent, highly social, flight-adapted animals in a home environment. The best solution is to replace the demand for birds as pets with a demand to keep all birds in the wild.  The threats to birds are real and global. Straw-headed bulbuls in Malaysia and Singapore have been poached to dangerously low numbers. Songbirds in China are trapped and sold for food or as pets. Migratory birds are netted and slaughtered by the hundreds across Northern Africa and the Mediterranean. Captive-born parakeets flutter in overcrowded cages at discount pet stores. Cockatiels, parrots, and other exotic birds repetitively pluck feathers from their own chests in revolt of their restrictive captivity.  On January 5, National Bird Day (http://www.nationalbirdday.org), we will reaffirm our commitment to birds everywhere and acknowledge that the fight for their freedom and survival is not over. We must persist. With 46 million birdwatchers in America, the market is ripe for respecting and appreciating birds in their natural habitat. National Bird Day is a chance to consider the welfare of all birds -- from the cage, to the backyard, to the skies across the globe.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Two years of negotiations between the Canadian government  and the energy sector to curtail carbon pollution have not  produced an agreement. Oil producers have balked at anything  more than the 10-cents-a-barrel carbon tax imposed by the  province of Alberta. Late last month, Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq pointed  to \"good progress\" in the talks but was unable to say when a  resolution might come. Concessions from Canada would make the pipeline more  palatable in Washington, experts say, since Obama has made  fighting climate change a second-term priority and has said that  Canada could do more to reduce carbon emissions. By linking Alberta's fields to refiners in the Gulf Coast,  the 1,200-mile (1,900-kilometer) Keystone XL pipeline would be a  boon to an energy patch where oil sands are abundant but lead to  more carbon pollution than many other forms of crude. Keystone's foes say that burning fossil fuels to wrench oil  sands crude from the ground will worsen climate change, and that  the $5.4 billion pipeline, which could carry up to 830,000  barrels a day, would only spur more production. Increasing oil sands production will put Canada on track to  miss its target of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 17  percent below 2005 levels by 2020, according to a government  report (full report:). Keystone supporters say that is why Canada would be wise to  offer a carbon-trimming plan before the White House decides the  pipeline's fate. \"If Canada were to volunteer new greenhouse gas  restrictions, that would certainly help,\" David Goldwyn, a  former State Department official and energy consultant, told an  industry conference in late October. But the clock is running out. The U.S. State Department is  finishing work on a report that will weigh the climate impacts  of the pipeline in what could be one of last words before a  decision. The White House is expected to rule on Keystone by  next spring.                 NEW LIMITS Canada and the United States have often moved together on  climate policy, developing similar rules on auto and power-plant  emissions while turning their backs on the Kyoto Protocol to  limit climate change. Regulating the oil and gas sector has been thornier, though,  with oil sands producers particularly concerned that higher  costs will erode their already narrow margins. \"Anything more stringent than today's system will increase  costs, possibly lowering investments and reducing production,\"  the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers wrote in a memo  to regulators in March that was made public under a freedom of  information request. Canada's fast-growing oil sands sector will soon exceed the  capacity of existing pipelines, and analysts say producers will  be forced to rely on trains, barges and other transportation  alternatives if Keystone XL and related projects are rejected.  Those options are generally costlier and less certain than  pipelines. Nevertheless, industry executives say they doubt yielding on  tougher pollution regulations will help secure Keystone. \"I don't know any policies in Canada with respect to  (greenhouse gas) emissions that would have any sort of material  impact on the approval process,\" Russ Girling, president of  TransCanada, the pipeline operator, said last month. Even if Prime Minister Stephen Harper were to offer new  greenhouse gas limits this year, the vagaries of the regulatory  process virtually guarantee those plans will not be in place  until after a Keystone decision. Canada needed 12 months to finalize regulations curbing  emissions from coal-fired power plants that were ratified last  year, and the rules were significantly weaker in the end than  originally proposed. \"Judging by what we saw with coal-fired power plants, there  is a real risk that a proposal to limit oil and gas emissions  could be watered down before it's final,\" said P.J. Partington   of the Pembina Institute, a think tank that has opposed oil  sands development, which reviewed the industry memos disclosed  under the freedom of information request.'}.

So Does Speaking Up About It.', body='Why do people leave organizations? Reasons often include dealing with bad management, finding a higher paid role elsewhere, or not seeing opportunities for promotion and growth. Workplace sexual harassment is rarely treated as an issue of retention, but it affects morale and career satisfaction at least as drastically as an issue like a difficult boss.\u00a0 Sexual harassment is one of the many ways workplaces are a hostile environment for women, pushing them out of organizations and sometimes entire industries. And sexual harassment clearly reflects the power structures that define our society. It exacts a high cost on all individuals and communities, but the price is disproportionately shouldered by women who can least afford it. Women of color and other marginalized women are among those hit hardest by a culture that for generations has turned a blind eye to the epidemic. \u00a0 Workplace sexual harassment comes with a steep cost: the cost of participation. A 2008 study by the American Psychological Association found a correlation between \u201cwork withdrawal\u201d\u00a0and the aftermath of sexual harassment for black women.\u00a0And in a\u00a02016 survey of the Chicago leisure and hospitality industry, where the majority of women are of color,\u00a049 percent of housekeepers said a guest had answered the door naked or exposed themselves. The most damning result? Of those housekeepers, 56 percent said they did not feel safe returning to work after the incident.  The system was failing these women. Formal report numbers were low, partly because the workers didn\u2019t believe it would make a difference to tell their stories. In fact, 43 percent of respondents said they knew someone who had reported harassment and seen nothing change. Unfortunately, their fears are well-founded. Two-third of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment\u00a0faced some sort of retaliation, according to\u00a0a 2003 study cited by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And although times are changing, they might not be changing for women in certain workplaces just yet.\u00a0  The outpouring of recent allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent consequences for some perpetrators have prompted many to say we\u2019re in the middle of a turning point in how sexual harassment is dealt with. This is true for some women, but not for all. When allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men turned Hollywood upside down, Jane Fonda pointed out the obvious:\u00a0The women speaking out were being listened to because they were\u00a0famous and white. Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center,\u00a0agreed, saying,\u00a0\u201cClass and race and stature play into whether someone is believed.\u201d Ironically, the #MeToo movement was started a decade ago by black social activist Tarana Burke. It took Alyssa Milano, a white actress, using the hashtag for it to go viral\u00a0\u2015 among other white women, at least.\u00a0We\u2019ve seen this before, such as in the\u00a0racism of the suffragettes,\u00a0FEMEN\u2019s attempts to \u201cliberate\u201d Muslim women\u00a0despite\u00a0protests,\u00a0and the exclusive nature of the\u00a0Women\u2019s March. When marginalized women, particularly women of color, need solidarity, their white sisters don\u2019t often show up.

The implication is clear: Yes, women who allege sexual harassment and other forms of abuse are to be believed \u2015 if they\u2019re the right kind of woman. The majority of women don\u2019t fit that criteria, and those who live and work at the intersections of marginalization \u2015 whether due to race, religion or disability \u2015 are often hardest hit by harassment. Unfortunately,\u00a0they\u2019re also the least supported. The eventual outcome is dismal.\u00a0\u00a0 For women who are not famous, wealthy or otherwise influential, socioeconomic, cultural and historical disadvantages compound to make it more likely that harassment will occur and less likely that it will be taken seriously.\u00a0 The\u00a0history of sexual exploitation through slavery\u00a0has created a culture where black women are\u00a0more likely to be sexually harassed\u00a0but\u00a0less likely to be perceived as victims. They are therefore less likely to report,\u00a0and the cycle continues. Socioeconomic status exacerbates this vulnerability; the majority (58 percent, as of 2013) of low-income families in the U.S. are a racial or ethnic minority.\u00a0Low-income women of color often\u00a0lack bargaining power,\u00a0face language and financial barriers to accessing legal services, and in some cases, are not even aware of their rights.\u00a0Undocumented workers also face unique additional challenges, as fears of retaliation or deportation may deter them from taking legal action. It is imperative to acknowledge that efforts to improve the lot of one group of women may only tangentially affect women in other groups.  If we are truly interested in building a world where all women feel safe, supported and able to fully participate in their communities and workplaces, we must remember a rising tide does not lift every woman\u2019s boat. We need to be proactive in our advocacy for low-wage women and women of color. We must ensure vulnerable women are provided adequate training, in the language they are most comfortable in, so they understand their rights. The more educated a workplace is, the less likely potential perpetrators will be to think they can get away with harassment. We need to find ways to support these women \u2015 legally, financially, emotionally \u2015 when action is taken. \u00a0 The #MeToo moment will be incomplete if it serves only the white, wealthy and otherwise privileged among us. Look around in your own workplace and make sure no woman is being overlooked. Failing to do so will not only affect the women as individuals, but will ultimately damage our workplaces, our communities and our societies. We will all be poorer for it.'}.

No matter who ends up getting these posts, Democratic nominees won\u2019t be able to write tough new rules or approve stiff penalties against corporate America. Appointees get seats at important tables, but with Republicans in charge of major agencies, they have little policymaking power. But Donald Trump isn\u2019t an ordinary Republican president, and the financial crisis of 2008 taught Democrats the value of committed watchdogs. Even if whistleblowers can\u2019t make policy, those with access to important financial information can highlight abuses. Even ostensibly minor posts can serve as a springboard to top-level oversight jobs. And let\u2019s face it: With Republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government, there just aren\u2019t many ways for Democrats to exercise power in Washington. So liberal activists and wonks have made it a priority to give Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) an earful on his recommendations for slots at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Trade Commision and the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2015 posts which party leaders have in the past shrugged off as relatively harmless opportunities to curry favor with industry lobbyists. Left-leaning groups are eyeing two vacant slots on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. And according to a source familiar with the nomination process, Schumer will recommend that Trump select the board\u2019s chairman, Martin Gruenberg, to fill one of the board slots when his current term at the helm expires. Thus far, Schumer\u2019s record on appointments during the Trump era is mixed. Progressives cheered his recommendation of Rohit Chopra for the FTC last year, but Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) temporarily blocked his pick for SEC commissioner, Robert Jackson Jr., arguing that he was too friendly with activist hedge funds and private equity firms. Jackson has since sided with Republican commissioners on at least one major vote, earning the ire of outgoing Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein \u2015 who Schumer will have ultimate say in replacing later this year. The Gruenberg pick signals that Democrats have decided to postpone the real fight over the FDIC board for another day. Gruenberg has assembled a solid but unremarkable record running the FDIC since 2011, largely overshadowed by two Republican appointees. His predecessor,\u00a0Sheila Bair, was widely considered the toughest bank regulator to serve during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Meanwhile, former board member\u00a0Thomas Hoenig\u00a0was a rare, outspoken GOP critic of too-big-to-fail banks.  \u201cI hope they have good reason to believe that Gruenberg understands how his role now shifts from wielding power diplomatically into being a witness and, when needed, a whistleblower,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank. Privately, several progressive bank watchdogs in Congress and at liberal think-tanks say they are saving their energy for Schumer\u2019s recommendation for the other FDIC board position. Schumer hasn\u2019t settled on a timeline for his pick for that job. Trump technically doesn\u2019t have to follow Schumer\u2019s lead on the nominations, but based on Capitol Hill convention, he almost certainly will. Presidents typically defer to the opposing political party\u2019s preferences on minority posts at three- and five-member commissions like the FDIC, and there are no indications that Trump plans to make an issue of these nominations.  Though left-wing activists have long criticized \u201cWall Street Chuck\u201d and his fundraising appeals to the banking sector, Schumer has a powerful pragmatic streak. He has repeatedly supported populist firebreathers when it serves Democratic Party interests. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) \u2015 the loudest big bank critics in the upper chamber \u2015 \u00a0were all Schumer recruits\u00a0as candidates. Gruenberg\u2019s record at the FDIC is similarly complicated. Progressives welcomed his opposition to a recent push from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to ease capital requirements on the biggest banks. But when a handful of Senate Democrats began working with Republicans to scale back Dodd-Frank rules on everything from racial discrimination in the housing market to capital requirements on banks with up to $250 billion in assets, neither Schumer nor Gruenberg spoke out against the effort. The resulting legislation is expected to clear the House and be signed into law by Trump. Late last year, the FDIC inspector general\u00a0dinged Gruenberg for his agency\u2019s sluggish response to over 50 data breaches that took place in 2015 and 2016, finding that it took an average of more than nine months to contact the hundreds of thousands of individuals whose personal information may have been compromised. But unless Republicans take issue with Gruenberg\u2019s record on cybersecurity, his nomination should glide through. '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

A lengthy investigative report from the Southern California News Group\u00a0\u2015 published Friday at one of the group\u2019s newspapers,\u00a0the Orange County Register\u00a0\u2015 says that USA Swimming ignored or covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the course of decades. The report is reminiscent of the recent USA Gymnastics scandal involving former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar\u00a0\u2015 where the people in power cared only about winning and safeguarding the sport\u2019s image, subsequently protecting and enabling an abuser to prey on young athletes.\u00a0 Citing court documents and internal communications, the SCNG report says USA Swimming enabled hundreds of predators, most of whom were coaches, and allowed a culture of abuse where it was accepted for older coaches to have sexual relationships with underage athletes. The article centers on Chuck Wielgus, the former USA Swimming executive director who died in April\u00a0of complications from colon cancer.\u00a0 \u201cUSA Swimming repeatedly missed opportunities to overhaul a culture within American swimming where the sexual abuse of underage swimmers by their coaches and others in positions of power within the sport was commonplace and even accepted by top officials and coaches, according to the documents and interviews with sexual abuse survivors, former Olympians, USA Swimming officials, safe sport advocates and some of USA Swimming\u2019s leading financial benefactors,\u201d the SCNG report states. USA Swimming did not respond to SCNG\u2019s requests for comment, the Register article notes. USA Swimming did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment for this story. SCNG sifted through hundreds of USA Swimming memos, emails, court records, law enforcement interviews and congressional reports, and concluded that the organization has been\u00a0\u201cunwilling to take on its coach-centric power base and obsessed with protecting its image and brand.\u201d The investigation made five principal claims: Top USA Swimming executives, officials and coaches knew of multiple sexual predators in coaching positions for years and did nothing to stop it.\u00a0\u00a0 Since 1997,\u00a0at least 590 alleged victims of sexual abuse have been identified in the USA Swimming world. At least 252 coaches and officials have been arrested, charged or disciplined by USA Swimming for sexual assault or sexual misconduct against athletes under the age of 18. In four of the past six years, \u201cat least 20 swim coaches have been arrested, charged or convicted for sex crimes ranging from rape, sexually assaulting a 3-year-old and 8-year-old, statutory rape, child pornography to secretly videotaping underage swimmers in locker-rooms,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0 At least 30 USA swim coaches or officials have been \u201cflagged\u201d by USA Swimming after being accused of or arrested for sexual abuse or child pornography by law enforcement. Most of the coaches and officials on the flagged list were able to continue working in the swim world. Some officials were not banned from the sport even after they had been convicted of felonies.\u00a0 Over the years, USA Swimming has been quick to spend money to settle sexual abuse cases before they can hit the public radar. Between 2006 and 2016,\u00a0USA Swimming spent $7,450,000 on legal fees.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear how much of that money was spent to settle sexual abuse cases, but SCNG notes that USA Swimming \u201carranged settlement agreements in at least three states with victims of alleged sexual abuse by swim coaches before the cases were even filed with a court.\u201d USA Swimming shelled out over $75,000 to lobbying firms to mobilize against California legislation that would have made it easer for sexual abuse survivors to sue their attackers and the organizations they worked for in civil suits. Mike Saltzstein, a former member of USA Swimming\u2019s board of directors, told SCNG that the organization\u2019s goal is to ensure its brand stays clean at all costs.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s the institutional incentive, intestinal fortitude, guts, if you will, to do what needs to be done,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cTheir attitude is let\u2019s smooth things over. Let\u2019s hide things.\u201d\u00a0 Former Olympic swimmer Ariana Kukors recently said\u00a0that her longtime coach Sean Hutchison sexually abused her for nearly a decade.\u00a0Kukors, now 28, said Hutchison began \u201cgrooming\u201d her when she was 13, after he became her coach at King Aquatic, a swimming club in Seattle.\u00a0 \u201cI never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,\u201d Kukors said. \u201cI was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I\u2019ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.\u201d Kukors said Hutchison waited to have sex with her until she was 18, and the two later moved in together. The swimmer described Hutchison as manipulative, jealous and verbally abusive. Hutchison has reportedly denied the allegations. Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer and founder of the advocacy group Champion Women, told SCNG it\u2019s somewhat common for top coaches to marry swimmers they once coached. That culture, she says, is wildly problematic. \u201cWhen the organization allows for marriages, allows for the 11-year-old to see her 18-year-old teammate who she thinks is a peer, she thinks they are the same, they go to the same meets, they\u2019re staying in the same hotel, they are working out together, then she sees that [older swimmer] marrying their coach so she thinks this is true love and doesn\u2019t recognize what an inappropriate situation this is,\u201d\u00a0Hogshead-Makar said.\u00a0 President Donald Trump signed a bill into law last week that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual abuse by regulating the governing bodies of amateur athletics, like USA Swimming. The legislation requires coaches and other sport officials to report any abuse allegations to police within a 24-hour period, and extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a person realizes they were abused. The bill also limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn\u2019t their parent.\u00a0 \u201c[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming \u2015 it\u2019s all amateur sports to protect all kids,\u201d Jeanette Antolin, a former gymnast who was abused by Nassar, told HuffPost\u00a0in January. \u201cBecause all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.\u201d\u00a0 Head over to the Orange County Register to read the report in full.\u00a0 Need help?

They also burn up costly, carbon-emitting fuel as they cruise around a limited area, often idling while kids get on and off.\n\nAll this makes school buses ideal candidates for electric motors, since they tend to idle and would rarely need to drive very far from a central charging station. Yet while a variety of fully electric cars are now available, the U.S. still has no all-electric school buses.\n\nThat may be about to change, however, thanks to two U.S. companies that have teamed up to make an electric bus for Kings Canyon Unified School District in central California. If it hits the road on schedule, it could be the country's first fully electric school bus. New York-based Trans Tech already developed one in 2011 that never went into service, but now its partnership with California's Motiv Power Systems is reviving the effort.\n\n\"This is Motiv's first electric school bus, and we anticipate that it will be the first electric bus to be certified and used as a school bus,\" a Motiv representative tells MNN by email. \"The school district who bought this bus, Kings Canyon Unified, plans to put it in routes before the end of the year. No electric school bus has ever been put into operation before.\"\n\nNamed SST-e, the Type A school bus will feature \"battery-agnostic\" design, which means it isn't wedded to any brand or type of battery, letting the bus adapt over time.\n\n\"[I]t 'future-proofs' fleets against changes in the battery market, such as discontinued batteries or future improved technology,\" Motiv CEO Jim Castelaz says in a press release. \"This makes a Motiv-equipped bus the most flexible and customizable all-electric powertrain for trucks on the market. We are thrilled the ePCS [electric powertrain control system] will be assisting schools to get the most out of their transportation dollars, while at the same time educating children on clean transportation.\"\n\nThe SST-e seats up to 32 students, according to the press release, or 24 students and one wheelchair. Districts can choose a range limit of 80 or 100 miles, depending on how many battery packs the bus holds, while fast-charging technology lets the bus reach 50 percent charge in less than an hour and full charge in 8 hours. The SST-e also comes with telemetry systems, providing real-time route data and preventive maintenance reports.\n\nThe bus isn't cheap; it costs around $175,000, while conventional Type A buses are often less than $80,000. But it can also help school districts save thousands of dollars every year in fuel and maintenance costs, its developers say, and prices should fall if it manages to open up a broader U.S. market for electric school buses.\n\n\"An electric bus can save a school district about 16 gallons of fuel a day, or around $11,000 in fuel savings over a year, not to mention maintenance savings,\" Trans Tech president John Phraner says in a statement. \"We are very excited to continue to help school districts reduce their transportation budgets and are committed to opening the market for the all-electric school bus.\"'}.

On July 20, 2017, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that for the first time ever, the United States will be able to export rice to China. China, which every 13 days consumes an amount of rice equivalent to the total annual U.S. rice crop, is expected to import 5.3 million tons of rice from the United States in 2017-18. One of the six rice-producing U.S. states is Louisiana. The third-largest rice producer, it exports roughly 60 percent of its rice annually. In 2016, Louisiana\u2019s exports of rough rice and milled rice totaled $444 million and $252 million, respectively. The opening of the Chinese market to U.S. rice exports represents a boon for Louisiana, which boasts the largest trade surplus with China of any U.S. state. This surplus is largely due to agricultural exports, which has also led to China becoming Louisiana\u2019s largest export market; exports were valued at $8 billion in 2016. There is also the possibility that Louisiana will benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201c100 day plan\u201d discussions with Chinese leadership that would allow for US exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China. China is the 3rd-largest market for LNG exports, and although competition from other suppliers remains a factor, the United States is poised to be a major player in the field. Louisiana is uniquely suited to capitalize on this growing relationship as it is home to the first and only big LNG export facility in the lower 48 states, located at Sabine Pass.

A six-person team from the Rising Hearts coalition, a D.C.-based nonprofit, launched\u00a0an elaborate website that was nearly identical to the team\u2019s page.\u00a0And the site\u2019s front page announced the good \u201cnews\u201d that the franchise had decided to rebrand as the Redhawks.\u00a0 \u201cNative Leaders Celebrate a Victory as Washington Football Changes Mascot to the Redhawks,\u201d a headline blared, in the style of The Washington Post. It and three other spoofed stories \u2015 on sites that looked like those of ESPN, Sports Illustrated\u00a0and Bleacher Report \u2015 circulated across Twitter and other social media platforms to applause from those who have spent years calling on the team to change its name.\u00a0Even the URLs mimicked the real thing, with only minor changes (the ersatz Post story, for instance, was on washpostsports.com, while the paper\u2019s real sports page is at washingtonpost.com/sports). It didn\u2019t take long for the internet to realize the whole thing was a fake, and that the team and owner Dan Snyder, who has pledged to \u201cNEVER\u201d abandon the name, had not done so. But that was precisely the point, said Sebastian Medina-Tayac, a Rising Hearts activist, Washington, D.C., native and member of the Piscataway tribe.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic called a culture jam,\u201d Medina-Tayac said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to do is take up space in the online world through these grassroots tactics. They have millions of dollars to spend on PR, run social media, and have air time on TV.\u00a0This is just a small moment \u2015 about three hours on a Wednesday morning, where we were able to take up space to remind people what this was really about.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about honor and courage and bravery, and our honorable history or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a racist name that a racist person doesn\u2019t want to change.\u201d In the past, Snyder has pushed back against claims that the name is racist, arguing that it \u201crepresents honor, represents respect, represents pride, hopefully winning.\u201d He did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment Wednesday. Rising Hearts\u2019 campaign took months to plan and execute, Medina-Tayac said.\u00a0 Native American activists have fought to change the \u201cRedskins\u201d name for decades, and the fight intensified in recent years thanks to lawsuits and high-profile campaigns against it. Pressure grew so intense on the franchise that it hired a team of Washington Republican consultants to help defend it in 2014. It was still fighting court battles to preserve it until early this year. The campaigns from grassroots organizations have continued, but media and public attention have waned. Rising Hearts hoped its off-the-wall effort would renew public attention to the issue, and remind people what they had been fighting for. \u201cI was happy to see that some people were immediately calling it out as fake,\u201d Medina-Tayac said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the conversation really started. They were living in an imaginary space where the name had been changed. Now that they found it was fake, it renews that passion that it should change.\u201d He said they chose to rebrand the team, rather than specifically call it out as racist, to show how easy it would be to change. \u201cOur goal was to come up with a proactive message \u2015 something that was positive,\u201d Medina-Tayac said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to boo the Redskins, we\u2019re going to cheer the Redhawks.\u201d By all indications, the campaign worked, at least in that it got people talking. Early Wednesday afternoon, the Washington franchise responded to the campaign on its official Twitter account: Statement from the Washington #Redskins pic.twitter.com/u3DQJFiFXi Medina-Tayac said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d that a small group with little funding forced the team to respond. \u201cI just want to give my sincere thanks to the people running that social media account and the Washington football team for acknowledging our hard work over the last few months,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the cherry on top, that they actually had to respond.\u201d'}.

Consider the professional athletes who have won multiple championships: the Tom Bradys and Kobe Bryants of the world. They\u2019ve mastered their craft, but their mindsets also set them apart from their peers. What do they do differently to reach peak performance?  Dr. Stan Beecham is a sports psychologist, and director and found member of the Leadership Resource Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He\u2019s the author of Elite Minds: How Winners Think Differently to Create a Competitive Edge and Maximize Success. Dr. Beecham has worked with the best of the best from all over the world, and has discovered some fascinating insights regarding ultra-successful people. I recently interviewed Dr. Beecham to learn from those insights. (The transcript below has been edited lightly for space and clarity.) Kevin Kruse: You say that the primary determinant of success isn\u2019t talent or experience; it\u2019s mindset.  Stan Beecham: Division one athletes are basically the top 1% of high school athletes. You could argue that professional athletes are another top five to 1% of those. When you get at that level, say for example, in professional football, the reality is everyone is talented.  I\u2019ve had the chance now for the last 25 years of working with these populations where everyone is talented. It becomes an issue of, \u201cWho are the kids that really fully maximize their talent? What are the things that get in the way that keep them from realizing their talent?\u201d  Do you really love this sport? But not only do you love this sport, do you love to practice? Do you love to go to the gym? If you\u2019ve got two kids with equal talent and one kid loves to practice, then his whole experience of practice is going to be different because he\u2019s doing something he wants to do. At the same time, you might also find kids who are okay with themselves. They\u2019re not trying to win someone\u2019s approval or show that they\u2019re good enough. They\u2019re just playing the sport out of the joy of it. These kids have a huge competitive advantage. We know that human beings are at their best when they\u2019re in the zone, when we\u2019re not concerned about ourselves. In fact, we don\u2019t even think. People who\u2019ve dabbled in sports psychology, they say, \u201cWell, the kid who\u2019s the better performer, they think differently.\u201d  The reality is not that they think differently. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t think. It\u2019s the absence of thought. It\u2019s the absence of cognition. It\u2019s the absence of emotion. That really is the advantage. Kruse: It\u2019s as if the unconscious mind moves so fast that it triggers faster than our conscious thinking, so we have to actually impact the unconscious. Beecham: Let\u2019s break it down. We know that it\u2019s the mental game that counts, whether it\u2019s sports or business. Because the mind is controlling the body. You have to think of the brain as the computer system, and you have to think of your belief system as your software.  So, you could be gifted, and you could be in great shape, but if the way that your mind is functioning is counter to that, you\u2019ll never realize that physical potential. The starting place is to become conscious of your own thought process. Most of us, we go through the day and we\u2019re thinking all day long. That\u2019s what the mind does. It thinks, and you\u2019re either aware of the thought or you\u2019re not, but you\u2019re thinking all the time.  For example, for an athlete going into a competition, if my belief about myself is, \u201cI\u2019m not as good as other people and I\u2019m not as good as these other guys,\u201d I carry that with me all the time, this sense of not being good enough or not being adequate. Then, you can see that there are certain thoughts that I\u2019m going to have which is, \u201cI need to play really well to do well,\u201d and so that belief system of what you hold as true is going to lead to a certain way of thinking, which is going to lead to a certain way of acting. If you think of people who consistently win, you would say, \u201cWell, they win all the time because they want to win, right? They want it bad enough.\u201d The reality is that\u2019s not true at all. It\u2019s that people that win and succeed at a high level, they don\u2019t actually think about winning. They simply believe they\u2019re going to do well. In other words, if I know I\u2019m going to win the game, then why would I even think about winning the game? If there\u2019s some uncertainty as to how I\u2019m going to do, \u201cAm I going to win or not?\u201d I will spend a lot of time thinking about that. Kruse: In terms of these unconscious beliefs in a work setting, I unconsciously might think I don\u2019t have a shot at a promotion, and that could affect my performance in the interview. Beecham: Yeah. What I would say to that person is, number one, don\u2019t do your job with the intention of getting promoted or recognized. Just do your job to the best of your ability.  In other words, if I start my career with the belief that I\u2019m going to have a successful career and I\u2019m going to get a lot of opportunities, and when I get an opportunity, I know I\u2019m going to nail it. Then, when I go to work, what I\u2019m thinking about is doing my job to the best of my ability. I think the kid who goes to work every day and they\u2019re trying to win someone\u2019s approval so that they can get a promotion or a raise, people sense that. You know that guy.  The best way to get a raise, the best way to get recognized is to not worry about it. Just do your job really well. The other people that are competent around you, they\u2019re going to see that you\u2019re competent, and they\u2019re going to offer you opportunities. Kruse: But what if I\u2019m a pitcher who really thinks we\u2019re going to win the game and I\u2019m going to get nine strikeouts, but there\u2019s that great hot batter that\u2019s been batting .450 lately. Or, I\u2019m that sales professional; I can say that I\u2019m going to win this deal, but in the back of my mind, I know we\u2019re up against the tough competitor and budgets are tight. What do we do to massage that unconscious or to really anchor that belief system? Beecham: Here\u2019s the reality of human beings. We\u2019re dynamic and we\u2019re always changing. Let\u2019s go back to the salesperson. One Monday, every time I call on someone, I thought I was going to get a yes and get their business, but I made six sales calls on Monday and everybody said no. Now, it\u2019s Tuesday, and all of a sudden, I\u2019m not feeling so confident. You see this in sport too where athletes go from having a lot of confidence to not. It\u2019s true for all of us. It\u2019s true for the best. The question is, how do I get back to it? It really goes back to looking at the bigger picture, and reminding myself that I had a bad day because everybody has a bad day. One of the things that\u2019s a problem with our hero-worship society is, we think of these people who are these great folks as successful people. We don\u2019t think that they struggle and experience failure the way that we do, but the fact of the matter is they do. In other words, most people\u2019s definition of success is the avoidance of failure. People who are really successful will tell you their definition of success is their response to failure, and they would actually argue that you have to have failure. In other words, there\u2019s no such thing of success without failure. Kruse: You say we need to stop trying to get better all the time. What do you mean? Beecham: We all live in a culture and society that\u2019s obsessed with better, right? We\u2019ve been taught since day one that in order to be successful, you have to always want to get better and at the moment you quit trying to get better, then the competition is going to pass you up. I believed that for most of my career. What I\u2019ve just learned in the last five years, is I really sat with this obsession with better and really said, \u201cWhat is this about? Like what is this born out of?\u201d What I realized is that the reason that we, most of us, want to be better is because we fundamentally believe that we\u2019re not good enough yet.  The problem with better is better is about the future. You can\u2019t get better now. But performance, everything that you do, you do in the now. You do in the present moment. Whatever the situation that you\u2019re in, even if it\u2019s not an ideal situation, you could still make the best of it. If you consistently do your best, what\u2019s going to happen to over time? You get better. You grow and develop by consistently doing your best. What I want people to understand is, is no matter what you think about yourself, you are good enough to do your best right now. No matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t be better than what you are. I know at first, it looks like a play on words\u2026but what we have to understand is, is this culture that\u2019s obsessed with better is also an anxious culture.  25% of American population has a diagnosable mental disorder, and 80% of that or 20% of us have an anxiety disorder, and anxiety is about the future. When the mind goes to the future, you quit performing at your best, so what we know about when human beings are at their best, they don\u2019t go forward in the future. They don\u2019t go backwards in the past. They stay present, and the mind gets really quiet, and you function optimally. The problem that I have with better is it keeps pulling you to the future. If you\u2019re a leader, just go to people and say, \u201cLook, all I\u2019m asking you to do is do the best that you can.\u201d If you\u2019re a leader of an organization whether it\u2019d be sport or business, what I would say is if you could get the people on your team to perform at their best, then you\u2019re doing your job at a high level.'}.

The man responsible for championing the most vulnerable New Yorkers is the same man now\u00a0accused of calling a woman of color his \u201cbrown slave,\u201d telling her she should get breast implants,\u00a0choking her until she couldn\u2019t breathe. The same man who publicly backed the Me Too movement allegedly wielded his powerful position as a threat in private, reportedly telling a woman: \u201cI am the law.\u201d The Democrat, who resigned Tuesday after the allegations surfaced in a New Yorker article the day before, has denied abusing the women, saying the actions were consensual.  The position of attorney general, a state\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, is extraordinarily influential, touching everything from policing amid the opioid epidemic to environmental and consumer protections. It can also serve as a pipeline to higher office, like a governorship. And right now, men hold the vast majority of these jobs: Only 12 of the 56 state and territory attorneys general are women; most are white.\u00a0 Campaigns are underway to make state attorneys general better reflect the populations they serve. Democrats have had at least 11 female candidates run for AG in 2018, including those who lost in a primary. Republicans currently have eight. The Democratic Attorneys General Association\u00a0launched the \u201c1881 initiative\u2033 last fall with the goal of ensuring that half of elected Democratic state attorneys general are women by the end of 2022. The initiative is focused on recruitment and training, and is\u00a0named for the year when two women in separate states ran for the office despite not being able to vote. \u201cWomen tend to look at the job more as protecting the most vulnerable in our community,\u201d Ellen Rosenblum, the attorney general of Oregon who is co-chairing the initiative, told HuffPost. \u201cNot to any way diminish the guys, because I think many of them do as well.\u201d The Republican Attorneys General Association is \u201calways searching for strong and compelling candidates who will defend the rule of law and who have the experience to do the job,\u201d spokesman Zack Roday said. \u201cFemale candidates are frequently the leading candidates for attorney general, not because they are female, but because they are the best person for the job. That is our focus.\u201d Tatewin Means, a former Oglala Sioux Tribe attorney general, faces a tough road running as a Democrat in a red state, South Dakota. But she\u2019s taking on the challenge because she\u2019s unhappy \u201cwith the status quo, with the usual course of business in the justice system and law enforcement,\u201d she said. One of her areas of interest is addressing the overrepresentation of American Indian youth in the state\u2019s justice system. Means sees herself as relatable to South Dakotans because of the obstacles she\u2019s had to personally conquer. \u201cWith this field predominantly white male, there\u2019s a certain sense of privilege attached to that,\u201d\u00a0Means said. \u201cHow can they possibly relate to average citizens that have to overcome those kinds of barriers?\u201d  Erika Harold, the Republican nominee for Illinois attorney general,\u00a0initially decided to become an attorney because of an experience she had in ninth grade,\u00a0when she was subject to \u201csevere racial and sexual harassment,\u201d including slurs and a death threat, she said.

Last November, Nessel, who would be the state\u2019s first openly gay AG,\u00a0published a tongue-in-cheek campaign ad:\u00a0\u201cWho can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting?\u201d \u201cThe reality is that judges, sheriffs, prosecutors and attorneys general need to look more like the populations they represent,\u201d Nessel told HuffPost. As for that ad, she is \u201cnow trying to move on to another P word, which is policy.\u201d The cohort of women already went up one this week, when Barbara Underwood, a Democrat, took over as acting attorney general after Schneiderman resigned.

They sustained themselves off fauna, and even slew dragons -- well, Komodos. It sounds like a science fiction novel, but these diminutive beings actually lived in Indonesia. They possibly even interacted with modern humans, according to researchers, who spent nearly a decade conducting lengthy excavations at Liang Bua\u00a0cave to uncover evidence of the \"hobbits\"\u00a0of Flores Island, whose scientific name is Homo floresiensis. The new research, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, readjusts the timeline of when \"hobbits\"\u00a0died out as a species -- pushing the date back from as recently as 12,000 years ago to a more likely 50,000 years ago.\u00a0If true, that would mean H. floresiensis might have had contact with modern humans, who would have traveled through the Indonesian islands en route to Australia. \"We don't know for sure, because we don't have evidence of them on the island before 11,000 years ago,\" Research co-author Dr. Matthew Tocheri, a\u00a0paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, told The Huffington Post. \"We know that modern humans reached Australia about 50,000 years ago, and you can't get there unless you go across these Indonesian islands,\" he said. \"Up until now, this has been a persistent issue in archaeology in this region.\u00a0We're just missing the evidence that we haven't discovered the sites that show exactly how modern humans navigated these islands to ultimately reach Australia, and Flores is one of them.\" The recent research involved a new analysis of old fossilized \"hobbit\" bones that were previously unearthed in the Liang Bua cave. Based on new-found stratigraphic and chronological evidence, the researchers concluded that those skeletal remains may be between 100,000 and 60\u2009,000 years old.\u00a0 The researchers noted that whether H. floresiensis\u00a0survived after 50,000 years ago is an \"open question.\" \"We dated charcoal, sediments, flowstones, volcanic ash and even the H. floresiensis bones themselves using the most up-to-date scientific methods available,\" said research co-author Dr. Richard Roberts, a professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia in a statement. \"In the last decade, we\u2019ve vastly improved our understanding of when the deposits accumulated in Liang Bua, and what this means for the age of \u2018hobbit\u2019 bones and stone tools,\" he added. \"But whether \u2018hobbits\u2019 encountered modern humans or other groups of humans -- such as the \u2018Denisovans\u2019 -- dispersing through Southeast Asia remains an open and intriguing question.\" For now, the researchers are hoping to gather more insight into the secret lives of the \"hobbits\" by using 3D imaging in the Liang Bua cave to map out the entire excavation site. (Learn more in the video below.) Archaeologists\u00a0first discovered H. floresiensis in 2003, when they found fossilized skeletal remains of the species buried roughly 20 feet down in the Liang Bua cave. \u00a0The research team that made this discovery nicknamed the small skeleton the \"hobbit,\" according to Tocheri. \"They were getting ready to publish in Nature and Mike Morwood, the lead archaeologist, started referring to it as the 'hobbit,' just amongst themselves because it was so small and so odd,\" Tocheri said. \"At the same time, it was when 'The Lord of the Rings' movies were really big, especially in Australia and New Zealand. When the initial paper was first published, and they were doing a press conference, it just slipped out -- and it touched a nerve and caught on.\" A skull and limb bones indicated that a fully grown adult H. floresiensis would have stood about 3.5 feet tall, and likely had an extremely small brain. \"We still know very little. In terms of their overall bodies, their brains are very small, essentially the same size as living chimpanzees,\"\u00a0Tocheri said.\u00a0\"Over a third smaller than modern humans, but there seems to be parts of the brain that, even though it's so small, suggests that it was more reorganized. There's a debate over how much large brain size relates to intelligence.\" Tocheri told HuffPost that this ongoing research is somewhat frustrating because the \"hobbit\"\u00a0fossils tend to resemble those of earlier species in the human family tree that date back to 1-3 million years ago. Nonetheless, finding H. floresiensis fossils in Indonesia sediments dating back to around 50,000 years ago suggests that there was an entire lineage of hominins that scientists may have essentially missed, from Africa, across Asia to the Indonesian island of Flores. \"I see it as our responsibility to document that diversity so that we better understand it and what it means for us to be human,\" Tocheri said.'}.

The work by Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson makes it possible to image proteins and other molecules after freezing them rapidly to preserve their shape, providing a powerful new tool for medical research. \u201cIt\u2019s like frames in a movie. Each of these pictures represents a frame and they can be put together into a movie and we can see what the molecules do,\u201d said Peter Brzezinski, a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry. BREAKING NEWS The 2017 #NobelPrize in Chemistry is awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank & Richard Henderson. pic.twitter.com/RUZSnArJHO The new approach fills a previously blank space by generating images of everything from the surface of the Zika virus to proteins that cause antibiotic resistance or are involved in Alzheimer\u2019s. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the $1.1 million prize, said the technology had moved biochemistry into a new era. By freezing biomolecules mid-movement, scientists can unravel previously unseen processes - a major advance both for basic understanding and the potential development of new drugs. Scottish-born scientist Henderson used an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at an atomic resolution, showing the potential of the technology. Until then, electron microscopes were only seen as suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroyed the biological material. His breakthrough was further developed by German-born scientist Frank, a U.S. citizen, while Dubochet of Switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules. Frank said cryo-electron microscopy had \u201cimmense\u201d potential for medical research, which is increasingly focused on processes inside cells, but it would take time for this to play out - and he was taken aback by news of the award. \u201cI was overwhelmed. I thought the chances of winning a Nobel prize were miniscule,\u201d he told a news briefing by telephone. Cryo-EM makes it possible to portray biomolecules after freezing them very fast (vitrification method) so its natural shape is preserved. pic.twitter.com/SXgeAVUk24 Henderson was equally taken aback and said he had rejected the first phone call from the Swedish academy on Wednesday before picking up second time. \u201cThe three of us who have been awarded the prize are sort of acting on behalf of the whole field,\u201d he told a news conference in Cambridge, England. Understanding the structure of proteins and working out how they interact in the body should spark fresh approaches to drug development, just as earlier advances had produced today\u2019s multibillion-dollar biotech drugs, he added. \u201cIn a few years, maybe five years, we might know most of the structures ... it\u2019s quite an exciting time,\u201d Henderson said. Indeed, cryo-electron microscopy is already delivering results, such as the recent discovery of the structure of tau protein filaments in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It was also put to work last year in the fight against Zika, when the mosquito-borne virus was linked to an epidemic of brain-damaged babies in Brazil. As alarm about the outbreak spread, scientists were able to generate three-dimensional images of Zika at the atomic level, jump-starting the search for potential drugs and vaccines. \u201cThe use of these methods has completely revolutionized structural biology so everyone now wants to buy this type of equipment and start this type of research, all over the world,\u201d Johan Aqvist, another Nobel committee member, told Reuters. U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific is a leading supplier of cryo-electron microscopy instruments. Chemistry is the third of this year\u2019s Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier this week. The prizes are named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace, in accordance with his will. While the chemistry award has sometimes been overshadowed by the towering reputations of physics winners such as Albert Einstein, laureates include ground-breaking scientists such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie, though she also won the physics prize. The award passed over one of the highest-profile fields of research, the so-called CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology that earlier this year allowed U.S. scientists to alter genes in a human embryo to correct a disease-causing mutation. \"We are facing a revolution in biochemistry\" - Nobel Committee Chairman Sara Snogerup Linse on the 2017 #NobelPrize in Chemistry discoveries pic.twitter.com/jLBMLeIFNr'}.

In an email provided to HuffPost, Kalanick wrote that he was taking the time off to grieve for his mother and did not indicate when he\u2019d return.\u00a0 \u201cFor Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve.\u201d Read Kalanick\u2019s full email below. A report about the company\u2019s practices, also made public on Tuesday, suggests that Uber \u201creview and reallocate the responsibilities\u201d Kalanick had. \u00a0 Uber hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to conduct an investigation following allegations of misconduct and sexual harassment in the workplace.\u00a0The report called on the company\u2019s board of directors to \u201cevaluate the extent to which some of the responsibilities that Mr. Kalanick has historically possessed should be shared or given outright to other members of senior management.\u201d Kalanick said in his email that his leadership team would be running the company while he is gone. He has limited his public comments since his mother was killed and his father injured in a boating accident in May. Tuesday\u2019s report makes sweeping recommendations to improve Uber\u2019s internal structure, from calling for more accountability for senior leaders to suggesting the company rewrite its policy to prohibit romantic relationships between managers and their reports. Uber\u2019s board of directors unanimously accepted the report\u2019s recommendations at a Sunday meeting. Implementing them will \u201censure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. The board had also discussed a leadership shakeup\u00a0\u2015 including a leave of absence for Kalanick \u2015 amid a period of intense turbulence for the ride-hailing company and a time of\u00a0personal tragedy for the embattled executive.\u00a0 Kalanick founded Uber in 2009 as a scrappy startup that eventually grew into a taxi-killing behemoth valued at nearly $70 billion.\u00a0But the 40-year-old has also faced torrents of criticism over Uber\u2019s toxic workplace environment and his personal behavior. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a\u00a0tell-all blog post\u00a0about the company\u2019s sexist culture that went viral. Fowler described being solicited for sex by a male manager, discriminated against by management and stonewalled by human resources for reporting the conduct of male employees there. In response to the allegations, Kalanick tapped\u00a0Holder to lead an investigation into Uber\u2019s practices with help from board member and former HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington.\u00a0Uber also hired a separate law firm,\u00a0Perkins Coie,\u00a0to specifically investigate sexual harassment and other workplace complaints by Fowler and other individuals. After Fowler\u2019s allegations became public, two of Uber\u2019s earliest investors, Mitch and Freada Kapor, spoke out and urged the company to switch gears. \u201cUber\u2019s outsize success in terms of growth of market share, revenues and valuation are impressive, but can never excuse a culture plagued by disrespect, exclusionary cliques, lack of diversity, and tolerance for bullying and harassment of every form,\u201d the two wrote in February. \u201cUber has had countless opportunities to do the right thing\u200a,\u201d they added. \u201cWe feel we have hit a dead end.\u201d In another sign of faltering confidence within the company, Uber President Jeff Jones abruptly quit\u00a0after just six months on the job in March, saying his \u201cbeliefs and approach to leadership\u201d were apparently incompatible with Uber\u2019s.\u00a0 In June, Perkins Coie\u2019s investigation prompted\u00a0Uber to fire 20 employees. The law firm looked\u00a0at 215 claims about\u00a0discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying and unprofessional behavior. One hundred claims resulted in no action; 31 required employees to receive additional training; seven prompted written warnings; and 57 remained under review.\u00a0 \u201cCulture changes have been well underway at the company for months now,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman told HuffPost after the firings. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re more committed than ever to turning the page. We want to change.\u201d The company hired three high-level female leaders to address its management issues, serve as an independent voice on the board and help repair the company\u2019s public image.\u00a0 But one of the biggest threats to the company\u2019s brand has been Kalanick himself. In June, Recode published an email\u00a0Kalanick wrote to employees in 2013 ahead of a company-wide celebration. The email contained profanities, laid out\u00a0rules for having sex with fellow employees and warned of a \u201c$200 puke charge.\u201d Earlier this year, Kalanick was widely criticized after he was caught on tape berating an Uber driver.\u00a0The video shows Kalanick discussing the company\u2019s fare structure with Uber \u201cblack car\u201d driver Fawzi Kamel at the end of a ride. Kamel, who purchased a nicer car to drive for the upscale \u201cblack\u201d service, tells Kalanick he \u201clost $97,000 because of you. I\u2019m bankrupt because of you.\u201d In response, Kalanick fires back, \u201cYou know what? Some people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own shit.\u00a0They blame everything in their life on somebody else.\u201d  \u201cGood luck,\u201d Kalanick adds, sarcastically, before slamming the door. Kalanick acknowledged that he needed help in an apology he wrote to employees after the video surfaced. \u201cIt\u2019s clear this video is a reflection of me \u2015 and the criticism we\u2019ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\u201d\u00a0 Uber has also struggled with issues beyond its corporate culture.\u00a0 In January, Uber faced backlash for appearing to break a New York City taxi picket line formed in solidarity with protests over President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. The hashtag #DeleteUber went viral and more than 200,000 people deleted the Uber app from their phones. The protest was only quelled once Kalanick announced he\u2019d resign from Trump\u2019s economic advisory council. The company is also fighting a lawsuit to continue its self-driving car program. Meanwhile, Uber competitor Lyft has\u00a0continued to pick up steam.\u00a0 Read Kalanick\u2019s full email announcing his leave here:\u00a0 Team, For the last eight years my life has always been about Uber. Recent events have brought home for me that people are more important than work, and that I need to take some time off of the day-to-day to grieve my mother, whom I buried on Friday, to reflect, to work on myself, and to focus on building out a world-class leadership team. The ultimate responsibility, for where we\u2019ve gotten and how we\u2019ve gotten here rests on my shoulders. There is of course much to be proud of but there is much to improve. For Uber 2.0 to succeed there is nothing more important than dedicating my time to building out the leadership team. But if we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve. During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company. I will be available as needed for the most strategic decisions, but I will be empowering them to be bold and decisive in order to move the company forward swiftly. It\u2019s hard to put a timeline on this - it may be shorter or longer than we might expect. Tragically losing a loved one has been difficult for me and I need to properly say my goodbyes. The incredible outpouring of heartfelt notes and condolences from all of you have kept me strong but almost universally they have ended with \u2018How can I help?\u2019. My answer is simple. Do your life\u2019s work in service to our mission. That gives me time with family. Put people first, that is my mom\u2019s legacy. And make Uber 2.0 real so that the world can see the inspired work all of you do, and the inspiring people that make Uber great. See you soon, Travis'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

After Tagovailoa was sacked for a 16-yard loss on first down, he found Smith wide open down the left side for the play that turned him into an instant legend in Alabama. Alabama forced overtime when Tagovailoa hit Calvin Ridley for a 7-yard touchdown pass on a 4th-down play with 3:49 remaining, capping its rally from a 13-point halftime deficit. The Crimson Tide had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but Andy Pappanastos pulled a 36-yard field goal try wide left as time expired. It was his first miss in 14 career attempts of 36 yards or shorter. Blankenship finished 14- and 13-play drives with 41 and 27-yard field goals for a 6-0 Georgia lead with 7:33 left in the second quarter. The Bulldogs made it a 13-0 game at halftime when wide receiver Mecole Hardman took a direct snap and scored on a 1-yard run with seven seconds remaining. Saban told his quarterbacks at halftime that he was going make the switch from Jalen Hurts to Tagovailoa and see how that impacted the offense. \u201cI just thought we needed to throw the ball in the game, and I thought he could do it better,\u201d Saban said of the true freshman out of Hawaii.

He led a seven-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs with 8:52 left in the third quarter. Georgia responded exactly two minutes later with a stunning score. Freshman Jake Fromm heaved a bomb down the right sideline for Hardman, who made the catch, eluded a tackle and tight-roped 80 yards to the end zone for a 20-7 advantage. Pappanastos brought Alabama within 20-13 with 43 and 30-yard field goals, giving Tagovailoa the chance to play the hero\u2019s role. Tagovailoa started the second half and completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns with an interception. Fromm was 16 of 32 for 232 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.

West is still more likely to be seen negatively than positively by members of both parties. But while Democrats are 55 percentage points more likely to view him unfavorably than they are to view him favorably, the gap among Republicans is just 9 points. That\u2019s a new development. In a 2015 poll (yes, of course, there\u2019s historical Kanye polling), his net negative among Democrats was 47 points, but among Republicans, it was a gaping 63 points.\u00a0 Just under half of all those polled in the most recent survey were aware that West had tweeted positively about Trump. Republicans who\u2019d heard that West praised the president hold an 18-point net favorable view of Kanye, compared to a 43-point net unfavorable view among those who hadn\u2019t. Among Democrats who were aware,\u00a0West\u2019s ratings are a net negative 72, compared to a net negative 37 among those not following the story. Americans are closely divided on whether celebrities should weigh in on politics, with 35 percent saying celebrities should publicly express their values and beliefs on controversial issues and 36 percent saying they should avoid publicly stating any political opinions. The rest aren\u2019t sure. Thirty-nine percent of Americans say there was a time when a celebrity\u2019s position on a political issue had an effect on their own willingness to see, hear or read that celebrity\u2019s work, while 40 percent say there wasn\u2019t. Fifty-eight percent of Democrats, but just 23 percent of Republicans, believe celebrities should take political stands. One likely reason for that: there\u2019s a strong perception that most celebrities dislike the president.\u00a0Less than 10 percent of Americans believe that most or all celebrities support Trump, while 44 percent say just some celebrities do and 21 percent think he has almost no celebrity support at all. If a celebrity publicly announced support for Trump, just 16 percent of Americans say they\u2019d think more highly of that person and 30 percent say they\u2019d think less of the person. If a celebrity publicly stood against the president,\u00a019 percent say they\u2019d think more highly of the person and 25 percent say they\u2019d think less. In both cases, the plurality say their opinion of the celebrity wouldn\u2019t change. Close to three-quarters of those who say they\u2019d think less highly of a Trump-supporting celebrity say it\u2019d be reasonable to stop following the celebrity\u2019s work for that reason. A nearly identical share of those who\u2019d think less highly of a Trump-opposing celebrity say that would be reason not to follow the celeb\u2019s work.

The disclosure notes that though Cohen made the payment in 2016, Trump didn\u2019t fully reimburse him for it until 2017. Cohen has admitted to having paid $130,000 in 2016 to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, who has gone public about a 2006 affair that she claims to have had with Trump.\u00a0The Wall Street Journal broke the news\u00a0of the payment in January.

After a few years of accelerating adoption of renewable energy and smart grid technologies, not to mention excitement about electric cars and developing-world electrification opportunities, the shine is off much of the promise of a brave new energy world that seemed imminent in the high-priced markets of only a few years ago. That is a natural reaction to the artificial boost of the energy-related stimulus spending in the first Obama term and includes a kind of relief on the part of energy sector planners that the natural gas boom (built on industry innovation now more than a decade old) will spare them the need for an expensive full-scale sector transformation. But some of that lull is because the business landscape remains a land of silos. Renewable energy people don't speak to oil industry types (and very much vice versa). Financiers veer away from energy technology startups to focus on century-old revenue models they understand, and the marketing gurus fail to see the virtue of brands the public knows little about or simply reflexively don't like.  But for innovation and sector change to happen, all those industry silos have to find ways to work together and to do that they need places to meet. They need to exchange ideas that lie at the periphery of their comfort zones, and see how new challenges to their thinking can create new opportunities for their businesses.  That's why I am part of New York Energy Week. The industry has too long been defined by a mindset that doesn't allow for creative cross-fertilization of ideas and best practices, a mindset that includes a manifesto of reliability built for an economic model of scale and centralization that is quickly passing out of relevance. At New York Energy Week, we've worked to bring the hackers at technology giants together with oil analysts, and to bring government watchdogs into conversation with self-professed disruptors. What better place to do that than New York City, where the entire world rubs shoulders on crowded streets and subways?  The U.S. energy sector is huge, profitable and a credit to the national and global economies. It is also too often invisible and isolated.

Rather than showing you a chronological feed of images, it will serve up photos in the order it thinks you'd like to see them. This will happen via an algorithm similar to the one that shapes your Facebook feed. Many accounts are worried that the tweak will make their content less visible, and they're\u00a0begging their followers to enable post notifications. Maybe you've noticed a deluge of posts in your feed that point toward the upper-right of your screen, demanding that you turn on these notifications that will send a ping to your phone whenever a new picture is posted. You'll have to turn this feature on for each individual account you want to get direct updates about. We don't recommend it.\u00a0 First of all, it's ludicrous that people and brands are asking you to turn on notifications now, when the update won't happen for a while.\u00a0For all we know, Instagram will eliminate post notifications as part of the algorithm change. Second,\u00a0if you start turning on post notifications for all sorts of individual accounts, you'll soon find yourself inundated by updates.\u00a0Phone notifications are distracting and awful, so why would you want to turn on even more of them? It's strange that people are freaking out about the coming update, even though it would ostensibly help them. After all, if you follow a lot of Instagram accounts, there's a good chance you're probably already missing important posts (baby pictures! puppies!) in your endless feed. This is exactly what the algorithm is supposed to fix. We can't know for sure how the algorithm update will work, but it makes sense to look at Facebook for clues. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has gotten pretty good at interpreting the people and things you're most interested in and displaying content based on those preferences. The social network also\u00a0lets you select certain people or accounts to see at the top of your News Feed, so it's likely that Instagram will let you do something similar. The accounts that are most worried, as The Cut points out, are brands that probably rely on Instagram for revenue. Rhubarb Paper Co., a greeting card company with nearly 4,000 Instagram followers, said in a post Monday that the algorithm update will be \"really bad for small businesses,\" implying that their content will be punished by an automated feed.\u00a0That might be true to an extent, since Instagram directly references \"your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of a post\" as parts of the algorithm, and it's hard for a brand advertisement to meet either of those criteria.\u00a0 In all likelihood, the update will produce a more pleasant Instagram experience for the average user while making it harder for fashion outlets and other retailers to show ads to people without paying the social network for sponsored placement. That's not to say Instagram is trying to silence the businesses that use its platform. If the new algorithm does its job right, those brands will still be reaching customers who are passionate about their products and actually like, comment on and share those photographs with frequency. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the record when reached by The Huffington Post Monday. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this article stated that Rhubarb Paper Co. posted about the algorithm update last Thursday. The company's post went up on Monday.

While we\u2019d previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers\u2019 hard drives,\u00a0the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team\u00a0at least as early as 2008\u00a0and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants. The Electronic Frontier Foundation\u00a0filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies.\u00a0 The documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client\u2019s computer, so it\u2019s hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u00a0 Seeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Per the EFF,\u00a0an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011,\u00a0was stored on unallocated space on the disk that \u201ctypically requires forensic software to find.\u201d Rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier\u2019s home \u2015\u00a0a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad \u2015\u00a0was obtained via \u201cfalse and misleading statements.\u201d\u00a0 EFF documents show this wasn\u2019t a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company\u2019s repair facility in Kentucky.\u00a0(The company\u2019s Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer\u2019s data.) Records uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had\u00a0\u201ceight FBI informants at Geek Squad City\u201d from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed. In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Best Buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches,\u00a0saying the company has both a moral and, in some cases, legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography \u2015 as it does \u201cnearly 100 times a year.\u201d Customers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to Geek Squad beginning any repair. \u201cAs a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography,\u201d the company said. \u201cOur policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer\u2019s problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do \u2014 and not do \u2014 in these circumstances.\u201d \u201cWe have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the FBI,\u201d the company continued. \u201cAny decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Subjugation In Steel', body='One cost of freedom is steel. To remain independent, America must maintain its own vibrant steel industry.  Steel is essential to make munitions, armor plate, aircraft carriers, submarines and fighter jets, as well as the roads and bridges on which these armaments are transported, the electrical grid that powers the factories where they are produced, the municipal water systems that supply manufacturers, even the computers that aid industrial innovation. If America imports that steel, it becomes a vassal to the producing countries. It would be victim to the whims of countries that certainly don\u2019t have America\u2019s interests in mind when they act. In the case of China, the attempt to subjugate is deliberate. Beijing intentionally overproduces, repeatedly promises to cut back while it actually increases capacity, then exports its excess, state-subsidized steel at below-market costs. This slashes the international price, which, in turn, bankrupts steelmakers in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Spain and elsewhere. Then, China dominates.  To his credit, President Donald Trump has said America can\u2019t be great without the ability to make its own steel. He ordered the Commerce Department to investigate the extent to which steel imports threaten national security. Commerce officials are scheduled Friday to brief Senate committees on the inquiry. That\u2019s because they\u2019re being second guessed by a handful of federal officials, exporters and corporations whose only concern is profit, not patriotism. To protect national security, American steel and family-supporting jobs, the administration must stand strong against foreign unfair trade in steel that kills American jobs and creates American dependency.  Imports already take more than a quarter of the U.S. steel market. They rose in May by 2.6 percent, seizing a 27 percent market share. That is dangerous. America can\u2019t rely on unfairly traded foreign steel as it tries to expand manufacturing jobs or when it faces foreign threats. Defense needs are the basis of the administration inquiry, called a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. National security relies on dependable, modern transportation and utility systems as well as armaments. To produce defense materials, factories need supplies to arrive routinely and electricity to flow consistently. Steel is just as crucial for roads, bridges, airports and utilities as it is for armor plate.  Some importers are pressuring Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross not to recommend imposing limits or tariffs on steel imports, asserting that the only consideration should be price. They contend that if China, South Korea, Japan and Turkey subsidize their steel production, which lowers the cost of exports, then American builders should benefit \u2013 no matter how much that damages national security or destroys steelworkers\u2019 family-supporting jobs. Their preoccupation with profit at their country\u2019s expense should disqualify them from consideration.  To be clear, American steel companies and my union, the United Steelworkers, have tried repeatedly to resolve the problem of trade cheating through normal channels \u2013 filing trade enforcement cases against the violators. But the United States has refused to take currency manipulation by countries like China into account. And every time an American company wins an enforcement case against a trade law violator and tariffs are imposed on a particular type of steel import, China and other cheaters begin subsidizing a different type of steel and exporting that.  American companies have won dozens of cases \u2013 welded stainless steel pressure pipe, rebar, line pipe, oil country tubular goods, wire rod, corrosion-resistant steel, hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, cut-to-length plate, grain-oriented electrical steel. But in every case, countries like China and South Korea find a way to circumvent the rulings by subsidizing some new steel product and exporting that or by trans-shipping \u2013 sending the product to another country first to make it look like the steel originated there to evade the tariffs.  American steel producers and steelworkers can compete successfully against any counterpart in the world, but they can\u2019t win a contest against a country.  The USW and American producers are looking for a broader solution now, something that will prevent cheating and circumvention across-the-board. And they have good reason to believe they can count on Commerce Secretary Ross. This is a guy who knows the industry and has a track record of saving steel mills and jobs.  At the turn of the century, as recession and the Asian financial crisis pushed more than 30 U.S. steel companies into bankruptcy, Secretary Ross bought a half dozen failing steel firms and restored them to solvency.   Because of his experience, Secretary Ross can be trusted to know the difference between China and Canada. American steelworkers and steel producers aren\u2019t looking for blatant protectionism. American firms and Canadian companies have relationships in which steel from Canton, Ohio, may travel to St. Catherines, Ontario, where it is converted into engine blocks that are then shipped back across the border to Detroit, Mich., for installation in cars. Canada doesn\u2019t illegally subsidize its steel industry or manipulate its currency. Only countries like China, Russia, South Korea and others that flagrantly violate international trade rules should be subject to the Section 232 sanctions.  Secretary Ross experienced the hell of 30 steel bankruptcies. He knows just how bad it can be for workers, companies and the country. With President Trump at his back, Secretary Ross now is key to ensuring American steel doesn\u2019t descend back into that hell and that America remains steel independent. '}.

L\u00e9a Barreaux: It\u2019s rather unusual to associate luxury with globalisation because they seem so alien to one another. Luxury is often considered as an \u201cillegitimate\u201d subject in anthropology. You, Marc Ab\u00e9l\u00e9s, have taken a different approach in establishing a global anthropology of luxury. Can you tell us more? Marc Ab\u00e9l\u00e9s: Luxury is a universal phenomenon. It is just as present in our society as it is in societies far removed from ours, in both space and time. It appears in various forms, depending on the group\u2019s specific history and culture. Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the pioneer scholars of anthropology focused on the circulation (kula-trading system) of precious goods (ceremonial necklaces and bracelets) in the Trobriand Islands, which he compared to the jewels of great European families in his ethnographic research.  Malinowski chiefly sought to uncover the significance of these objects and the symbolic and political connotations that determined the manner in which they were circulated. Well known to anthropologists, the potlatch, a gift-giving system among Native Americans, illustrates this phenomenon too. Its lavish spending, competition to impress and consumption of wealth has been extensively studied, namely by American anthropologist Franz Boas.  I also want to examine the political, symbolic and economic issues inherent in all forms of exchange, through the prism of the circulation of luxury goods. I am simply doing it in a very different context than that of traditional anthropology. These days, luxury commerce is carried out on a global scale and represents a significant portion of the world\u2019s economy. At the end of the 20th century, the luxury industry, along with other sectors of the economy, underwent a dual process of concentration of ownership and financialisation.   It is one of France\u2019s few growing sectors and it makes up the bulk of our exports, along with the arms and aeronautic industries. In light of this, I can\u2019t see why luxury should be treated as an \u201cillegitimate\u201d subject.  Also, we should ask ourselves why there is such a need to ascribe legitimacy in the field of social sciences. Did you know that Pierre Bourdieu, the sociologist best known for The Weight of the World kicked off his academic journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales with an extensive article on fashion?  L\u00e9a Barreaux: You\u2019ve been studying the anthropology of globalisation for a long time. These days, your focus is on China, a country with a huge appetite for luxury goods and one of the world\u2019s leaders in counterfeit products. Has China\u2019s influence revolutionised the very nature and definition of luxury in the globalised world? What does it say about our own idea of authenticity?  Marc Ab\u00e9l\u00e9s: Actually, rather than trying to eradicate the counterfeit market entirely, which would be quite simply impossible, China has made real efforts toward limiting the worst excesses of counterfeiting. For example, in 2006, the Chinese government closed one of its counterfeit industry\u2019s major outlets, the Xiangyang Road market in Shanghai.  That being said, one of the characteristics of luxury is to give rise to imitation, as a kind of counterpoint. This dialogue between \u201cfake\u201d and authentic contributes to the value placed on luxury products.  L\u00e9a Barreaux: The globalisation of luxury goods is also felt in the field of contemporary art. On the one hand, it has given artists greater freedom of movement across national borders and a wider audience; on the other, it has increased speculation in the art market. As an anthropologist, how have you seen these trends manifest?  Marc Ab\u00e9l\u00e9s: There is a great deal of overlap between luxury commerce and the contemporary art market. Most businesses in the luxury sector involve artists in their creation process \u2013 they create foundations to promote contemporary art, and in some cases, also run auction houses. Luxury has become a global industry. It is under constant threat of homogenisation and trivialisation. Companies essentially want to project an image of extraordinary refinement by associating what is currently most priced in contemporary art with their brand.  Looking at the Art Basel Miami Beach contemporary art fair, it was clear to me that this event is not solely designed for collectors; it also provides a platform for businesses in the luxury sector to promote their products. Looking at these kinds of events from within isn\u2019t enough: we need to understand their impact on the city and the way they create connections between the rich and privileged, and a general public that is hungry for cultural symbols.  L\u00e9a Barreaux: Establishing a global anthropology of luxury brings up a range of political issues and reveals the transformations that modern-day capitalism has undergone. How do you hope to contribute to these discussions without making prescriptive judgements about the positive and negative aspects of globalisation?  Marc Ab\u00e9l\u00e9s: We cannot distinguish the trends affecting the industry and commerce of luxury from broader changes within capitalism. Anthropology provides a multifaceted point of view by approaching luxury as a total social artefact.   As for prescriptive judgements, luxury is often associated with wealth, which can lead to it being condemned (as evidenced by the amount of moralising literature that has been published on the subject since ancient times). I think we should remember instead that, in 1871, members of the Paris Commune published a manifesto in which they celebrated luxury and made it their aim to bring it to the people.  After all, the right to luxury could constitute a legitimate claim. Luxury is neither an illegitimate subject for social science, nor one that is inherently off-limits to ordinary citizens.

She had gathered up the child and her other children and brought them to the church. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call 911? You have to call 911,\u201d the pastor told her. The woman, he recalled later, broke down. \u201cIf I tell the police, they\u2019ll arrest me, too,\u201d she said. As an unauthorized immigrant, she was terrified of talking to the police despite a city policy that bars officers from asking anybody about their immigration status. A year and a half of struggle between the Trump administration and immigrant-friendly states and cities has led to a stalemate: So-called sanctuary cities and states are reducing deportations, but raids aimed at stirring fears are having their intended effect, according to a new yearlong study by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Federal immigration officials told the authors of the report that in places where local law enforcement won\u2019t help them deport immigrants who have landed in jail, their alternative is to look for such people on neighborhood streets. Stymied by local resistance, the Trump administration may never get deportations back to the recent high of 200,000 in 2010, under President Barack Obama. But highly publicized raids in sanctuary cities are taking a toll on immigrants\u2019 peace of mind. \u201cThey\u2019re sending a message. And the message is being received,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. \u201cWhen we were on the street in Chicago,\u201d he said of the sanctuary city, \u201cwe heard the same expressions of anxiety as we did in places like Houston and suburban Atlanta, the fully cooperative jurisdictions.\u201d That fear and anxiety has caused unauthorized immigrants to retreat from public life in many cities, immigrant-friendly or not. Immigrants already are more reluctant to report crimes and to use health services and other benefits, the report concluded. In many cities, crime reports by Hispanics fell after the start of the Trump administration, especially for sexual assault and abuse cases, even as reports by non-Hispanic people rose. The Migration Policy Institute report underscores the unevenness of immigration enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice has threatened legal action against many cities that don\u2019t cooperate with ICE, and Texas has curbed sanctuary policies in Travis County, home to Austin. At the same time, California is facing pushback from San Diego and Orange counties as it implements a statewide sanctuary policy. Chicago and other immigrant-rich sanctuary cities, along with California, have been able to control deportations over minor crimes by refusing ICE access to local jails through so-called detainers seeking to take custody for possible deportation. In cities that are cooperating with federal immigration authorities, even a traffic arrest can expose an immigrant to deportation, especially if a court has ordered deportation or the individual has returned after a previous deportation. \u201cAbout 1 in 10 unauthorized immigrants is in this situation where they\u2019ve already exhausted their rights under the legal system,\u201d said immigration attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Falls Church, Virginia. \u201cThey\u2019ll be deported basically as soon as ICE can arrange a flight.\u201d Local raids can help federal authorities recover some of the potential prisoners lost to sanctuary policies, but not many, the study found. Six percent of prisoners freed because jails declined an ICE request, or \u201cdetainer,\u201d are later arrested by ICE. That\u2019s frustrating to the immigration officials the Migration Policy Institute interviewed for its study. \u201cTo the extent jurisdictions do not cooperate,\u201d ICE officers told MPI, \u201ctheir agency has little choice but to carry out enforcement activities in neighborhoods and other community locations, even though it is not as efficient a use of their time or resources, nor does such enforcement yield the numbers that can be identified by screening cases in local jails.\u201d Such raids also result in the arrests of bystanders, called collateral arrests, if officers come across other unauthorized immigrants while looking for those targeted for crimes or immigration-related offenses. More than two-thirds of the 650 arrested in one major operation were collateral arrests of people who were not targeted, many simply bystanders, according to the MPI study. Such arrests can spread fear but don\u2019t necessarily mean immediate deportation. An unauthorized immigrant without a deportation order is entitled to a court hearing. They may wait years to get one because court dockets are so full, said Sandoval-Moshenberg, who represents a dozen people arrested as bystanders during raids last year in Virginia. \u201cThey stop you and say, \u2018Have you heard of so-and-so?\u2019 You say no and then they say, \u2018What about you \u2014 do you have papers?\u2019\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said. None of his clients have been deported, he said, and some won\u2019t even face court hearings until after the 2020 election. Such raids, and the actions of enforcement-friendly states and cities, have increased arrests and deportations in the short term. Deportations overall remain low compared with the early years of the Obama administration. Arrests and deportations by ICE remain about half what they were in 2010 and 2011, when there were about 300,000 immigration arrests and 200,000 deportations a year.   Without local officials feeding arrestees to ICE through detainers and other methods of cooperation, the Trump administration does not have the manpower to get those numbers back up to Obama-era levels. California, home to a fifth of the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, reduced cooperation to a new low last year by banning any communication with ICE\u00a0about suspects charged with minor crimes. \u201cThe great variation in how states and localities cooperate with ICE,\u201d the study says, \u201cmeans that the fortunes of an unauthorized immigrant in Texas, Tennessee, and Georgia, where the mere act of driving can result in arrest and deportation, are entirely different than in California, Chicago, and New York, where immigrants can be arrested for a variety of crimes and still not be taken into ICE custody.\u201d If stress is unpredictable even in sanctuary cities, the same is true for strict-enforcement areas such as Prince William County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. The county gives full cooperation to ICE and detainer requests were up 16 percent between 2016 and 2017, but they are still down by a third from 2013, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Dimas Navarro, a middle-aged heating and air-conditioning worker from El Salvador who lives in Prince William County with legal work permission, said crackdowns come and go in the immigrant community. In the past, Navarro said, hostility drove Central Americans to neighboring Maryland, where they were more welcome. But today Navarro thinks they\u2019re starting to return to Virginia, driven by plentiful work in construction. \u201cThere\u2019s good times and bad times. It depends on who\u2019s in power,\u201d Navarro said on a recent day. \u201cThey were stopping everybody checking papers for illegal immigrants. Now, no. Now everything is OK. You never know when it\u2019s going to change, though.\u201d Navarro said he was only stopped by police twice while driving, once for not coming to a full stop at a stop sign, but had no trouble since he has a driver\u2019s license. The MPI report found that suburban police were more likely to use traffic enforcement to target immigrants. Gwinnett County in suburban Atlanta, for example, held as many as 184 immigrants for ICE in a month last year \u2014 most had been arrested on traffic charges. \u201cOur clients are getting arrested for things they should not be, or that white people would not be arrested for,\u201d said Lisa Johnson-Firth, an immigration attorney in Manassas, Virginia. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors less immigration, defended the ICE practice of arresting people in the community during raids. \u201cICE\u2019s goal in making arrests is not to sow fear but to arrest and remove deportable criminal aliens who have no right to be here,\u201d Vaughan said, adding that they \u201cshould not be allowed to remain at large to prey on new victims.\u201d ICE did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In Baltimore, Lewandowski said he was able to calm his parishioner and get police to investigate the sexual assault without questioning the woman\u2019s immigration status. But not all his parishioners have been so lucky: Recently a young man, a husband and the father of small children, was pulled over by ICE after buying supplies at a lumberyard. \u201cHe said, \u2018How did you know I was here?\u2019 and they said, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve been following you for a couple of weeks, but your family was always with you and we didn\u2019t want to have to arrest them.\u2019 \u201cI guess you could say that was ICE being kind,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cBut he was deported, and now his wife is alone here and she has to learn to find a job and support that family. They just created a single-mother family.\u201d     Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

In a brief, unanimous opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court threw out the damage award and sent the case back to an appeals court to reassess it. That means Samsung will still be on the hook for a yet-to-be-determined amount. A jury found the company violated three design patents held by Apple that govern the iPhone\u2019s curved exterior and icon-based interface. Because these features make the iPhone stand out from competitors, Apple argued that it was entitled to the entire $400 million figure \u2015 which represents Samsung\u2019s entire profits from all of its smartphone models that were found to violate iPhone patents. The Supreme Court rejected that argument, noting that in design patent law \u2015 which requires patent violators to hand over total profits after they\u2019ve been found liable\u00a0\u2015 the term \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d should be read broadly. \u201cSo understood, the term \u2018article of manufacture\u2019 is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. Notably, the high court declined to go further than that. It\u2019s now up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent cases, to resolve whether each of the iPhone design patents at issue in this controversy represent the end product or are merely components. What that court decides should significantly limit how big a slice of Samsung\u2019s profits Apple will get. When the Supreme Court heard the case in October, the justices\u00a0signaled that Apple may be headed for a loss \u2015 and that embattled Samsung would notch a small victory in a string of otherwise bruising court battles that, for the most part, the company has already lost big time. \u201cIt seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone. It\u2019s not applied to ...\u00a0all the chips and wires,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said at the hearing. \u201cSo there shouldn\u2019t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.\u201d Apple downplayed the significance of the ruling and said the focus should be on Samsung\u2019s theft of patented ideas \u2015 a fight that will continue in the lower courts. \u201cThe question before the Supreme Court was how to calculate the amount Samsung should pay for their copying. Our case has always been about Samsung\u2019s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\u201d Apple spokeswoman Rachel Wolf Tulley said in a statement to The Huffington Post. \u201cWe will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world\u2019s most innovative and beloved product.\u201d Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Japanese Space Agency\u2019s Mission Aims To Uncover How Moons Of Mars Formed', body='Elizabeth Tasker, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has announced a mission to visit the two moons of Mars and return a rock sample to Earth. It\u2019s a plan to uncover both the mystery of the moons\u2019 creation and, perhaps, how life began in our Solar System. The Solar System\u2019s planets take their names from ancient Greek and Roman mythology. Mars is the god of war, while the red planet\u2019s two moons are named for the deity\u2019s twin sons: Deimos (meaning panic) and Phobos (fear). Unlike our own Moon, Phobos and Deimos are tiny. Phobos has an average diameter of 22.2km, while Deimos measures an even smaller 13km. Neither moon is on a stable orbit, with Deimos slowly moving away from Mars while Phobos will hit the Martian surface in around 20 million years. The small size of the two satellites makes their gravity too weak to pull the moons in spheres. Instead, the pair have the irregular, lumpy structure of asteroids. This has led to a major question about their formation: were these moons formed from Mars or are they actually captured asteroids? Our own Moon is thought to have formed when a Mars-sized object hit the early Earth. Material from the collision was flung into the Earth\u2019s orbit to coalesce into our Moon. A similar event could have produced Phobos and Deimos. The terrestrial planets were subjected to a rain of impacts during the final throes of Solar System formation. Mars shows possible evidence of one such major impact, as the planet\u2019s northern hemisphere is sunk an average of 5.5km lower than the southern terrain. Debris from this or other impacts could have given birth to the moons. Alternatively, Phobos and Deimos could be asteroids that were scattered inwards from the asteroid belt by the looming gravitational influence of Jupiter. Snagged by Mars\u2019s gravity, the planet could have stolen its two moons. This mechanism is how Neptune acquired its moon, Triton, which is thought to have once been a Kuiper belt object, like Pluto. There are compelling arguments for both the #TeamImpact and #TeamCapture scenario. The orbits of the two moons are circular and in the plane of Mars\u2019s own rotation. While the chance of this happening during a capture event are extremely low, observations of the moons suggest they may have a composition similar to that of other asteroids. Definite determination of the moons\u2019 composition would act as a fingerprint to distinguish the two models. A collision event should result in moons made from the same rock as Mars. But if the moons were captured, they would have formed in a different part of the Solar System with distinct minerals. This is where the new mission comes in. JAXA\u2019s Martian Moon eXploration Mission (MMX) is due to launch in September 2024 and arrive at Mars in August 2025. The spacecraft will then spend the next three years exploring the two moons and the environment around the red planet. During this time, MMX will drop to the surface of Phobos and collect a sample to return to Earth in the summer of 2029. Due to their weak gravity, collecting a sample from small rocky bodies is a difficult challenge. But this is JAXA\u2019s speciality. The space agency has previously returned samples from asteroid Itokawa in 2010. The sequel to that mission, Hayabusa2, is due to arrive at asteroid Ryugu next year. The excitement for a Mars moon mission has led to strong international involvement in MMX. On April 10, JAXA president Naoki Okumura met his counterpart from France\u2019s Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES), Jean-Yves Le Gall. The meeting cemented a collaboration between the two space agencies. CNES will provide an instrument for MMX as well as combining expertise on flight dynamics for the tricky encounter with the Martian moons. The French instrument will combine a high-resolution infrared camera and spectrometer, a technique that analyses the composition of each image pixel. This will allow the rocks of the Martian moons to be investigated down to a few tenths of a metre. With a pixel size an order of magnitude smaller than that of similar instruments on missions such as NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA\u2019s Mars Express, the spectrometer will also be able to help MMX select the best landing site on Phobos and take the sample. CNES will also explore the possibility of building a rover to explore the surface of Phobos. A decision will be taken in November this year. In addition to the collaboration with France, MMX will carry an instrument from NASA. While the CNES spectrometer will examine the type of minerals on the moons, the NASA instrument will pick out individual chemical elements. This is done by analyzing the high-energy Gamma rays and neutrons that are produced during the bombardment of cosmic rays from the Sun or more distant sources. Together, these instruments will reveal a more thorough composition of Mars\u2019s mysterious satellites. Both #TeamCapture and #TeamImpact offer fantastic science. Moons formed from collisional debris would be preserved time capsules of conditions on the young Mars. In this early epoch, Mars and the Earth are expected to have been far more similar than now. A sample from this time could reveal how a planet becomes habitable. But moons captured from the asteroid belt would be kin to the meteorites that rained down on the young Earth. These are thought to be the deliverers of our oceans and even our first organic molecules. A sample from Phobos would be a taste of the package that was flung around the early Solar System. Phobos\u2019s ever decreasing distance to Mars also means that the top layer of the moon\u2019s soil should be littered with meteorites scattered from the planet. Such a short journey would allow much lower-density material to survive the trip, unlike the Martian meteorites that manage to reach Earth. This transferred material will also be from all over Mars, rather than the small patch that rovers have examined. And it might result in a more complete picture of Mars, as well as of its moons. MMX is an exciting mission, bringing information about moon formation, Mars and water delivery around our Sun. As we wait for 2024, are you voting for #TeamImpact or #TeamCapture?

The barefoot prints indicated a variety of activity, so the humans weren\u2019t simply passing through, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. The first North Americans are widely believed to have crossed from Siberia to Alaska via a Bering land bridge. The footprints suggest the early travelers then may have traveled south along the Pacific coast, rather than farther inland.\u00a0 The findings add to the \u201cgrowing body of evidence that early peoples in the Americas inhabited the coastal margin and circumnavigated the western edge of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet to move between Beringia [the land bridge] and mid-latitude North America at the end of the last ice age,\u201d the authors wrote. The prints,\u00a0found during excavations from 2014 to 2016, also suggest the humans may have traveled among islands via primitive boats, though no evidence of boats has been found. The footprints provide\u00a0\u201cevidence of the seafaring people who inhabited this area during the tail end of the last major ice age,\u201d Duncan McLaren, lead author of the study and anthropologist at the Hakai Institute and University of Victoria in British Columbia, said in a statement.\u00a0 At the end of the ice age, from 11,000 to 14,000 years ago, the sea level was as much as 10 feet below what it is now. The footprints were likely just above the high-tide line at the time. \u201cThe footprints were impressed into a soil just above the paleo-shoreline, possibly by a group of people disembarking from watercraft and moving towards a drier central activity area,\u201d the study said. \u201cAs this island would only have been accessible by watercraft 13,000 years ago, it implies that the people who left the footprints were seafarers who used boats to get around, gather and hunt for food, and live and explore the islands,\u201d McClaren told The New York Times. The few archeological sites discovered previously as far north were slightly earlier, from 12,700 to 11,800 years ago, according to Ars Technica. Human footprints 14,000 years old have been discovered in Argentina and Chile. The earliest boat is a dugout canoe in the Netherlands dated about 10,000 years ago.'}.

This can lead to safety concerns and reveals a substantial quality-of-life gap between Uber and Lyft's star rating systems. Lyft representatives told The Huffington Post that a driver and passenger will never ride with one another again if either party gives the other a rating lower than four stars after their trip.\u00a0But with Uber, it appears that pairing can happen repeatedly, despite a bad experience, unless one party carries out the inconvenient task of reaching out to customer service and identifying the bad driver or passenger. While it may sound like nitpicking a technical issue, HuffPost has spoken to several drivers who have been paired with a bad customer, only to inadvertently pick them up again. One driver said she was harassed several times by the same customer after the app continued to pair them up. She also said she knew of another customer who gave a driver a low rating after being harassed and stalked by him, only to be paired with him again. The system technically allows either situation to happen. The drivers who spoke to HuffPost wish to remain anonymous, and Uber didn't respond to repeated calls for comment. \"We've heard plenty of those stories in California, stories of drivers who have been re-paired with people when one party or the other had problems,\" said driver advocate and International Teamsters Vice President Rome Aloise. \"We need to have an entity so that drivers can speak with a single voice to Uber about these problematic things.\" Indeed, the general inability to organize has been a huge issue for Uber drivers over the years. The company has allowed associations to\u00a0crop up all over the country, allowing a bit of unification -- but not unionization -- among drivers. The company agreed to start a guild for 35,000 drivers in New York in May, which advocates hailed as a small step in the right direction for workers' rights. But contractors say their inability to unify and communicate among themselves has exacerbated smaller problems like the star rating issue. Uber's star ratings system could spell trouble for passengers, too.\u00a0That said, Uber drivers do need to keep a stellar rating to stick with the company. Internal documents leaked\u00a0in 2015 showed that drivers are expected to keep an average rating of 4.6 stars or above, lest the company consider kicking them off the force. Note: The Huffington Post's Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber's board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site's coverage of the company.'}.

Thomas Brunell, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, told Science Magazine that the Trump administration was justified in adding the question, even if the motivations were political. Last year, the White House tapped Brunell to be deputy director of the Census Bureau, but his appointment drew controversy, and in February the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau, said he was no longer under consideration.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m agnostic on whether [the citizenship question] is needed,\u201d Brunell told Science Magazine in an interview published Wednesday. \u201cI think the critical point is that the administration wants to put it on there. They have made a political decision. And they have every right to do that because they won the election.\u201d Brunell\u2019s comments are notable because officials at the Commerce Department and the Census Bureau have publicly insisted that the decision was not political. In a March memo justifying the decision, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the department would add a citizenship question after the Department of Justice requested better data to enforce the voting rights. Adding the citizenship question, Ross said, was the best way to get the Justice Department the citizenship data it said it needed. Brunell did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration is facing a handful of lawsuits challenging the decision to add a citizenship question. In some of those challenges, the plaintiffs \u2015 several different states \u2015 argue that one of the reasons for the decision is illegal is because it is unnecessary and \u201carbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion\u201d under federal law. ProPublica reported that John Gore,\u00a0a political appointee who is the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, was behind the citizenship question request. The Trump campaign had also appealed for donations\u00a0based on the addition of a citizenship question. During a preliminary hearing in one of the lawsuits last week, government lawyers distanced themselves from those fundraising emails, saying that adding the citizenship question was Ross\u2019 decision, not Trump\u2019s. Critics say the Department of Justice already has adequate citizenship data to enforce the Voting Rights Act. They say adding a citizenship question will make it less likely that immigrants and other skeptical of government will respond to the census out of fear of what the government will do with their data (even though it is a crime for the Census Bureau to share any of the data it collects). An inaccurate count would have significant consequences since census data is used as the basis to draw electoral districts and allocate billions in federal funding. \u201cThe Census is supposed to apolitical and count every person living in this country. A citizenship question totally undermines those requirements,\u201d Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. Brunell told Science that concerns over adding a citizenship question were overblown, saying that he thinks adding any question could be viewed as problematic. \u201cAsking people their favorite color will decrease response rates,\u201d he said. Still, he added, following up and counting people who don\u2019t mail back their census forms may be more costly.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Here's What It Means.', body='If the recent news from Washington isn\u2019t a little unsettling, maybe you should look again. A new administration has brought some unconventional thinking to the Oval Office, and the repercussions could be felt for years by American consumers. Among the changes: An executive order that whenever an executive department or agency publicly proposes a new regulation it will identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed. The appointment of cabinet members and agency heads openly hostile to government regulation, notably Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, who rescinded a plan to regulate cable TV set-top boxes. Heads of industry have been meeting with the new president and his cabinet members, and the signs are alarming. In one recent meeting with business leaders, the president vowed \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be cutting regulation massively.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter how you voted in the last election, or if you voted at all. These actions are bound to affect you. The question is: where, when and how? \u201cThe industries that are likely to deregulate faster \u2015 where consumers will also notice \u2015 are the healthcare and financial sectors,\u201d says Suryadipta Roy, and associate professor of economics at High Point University. The financial industry has already felt some of the deregulatory effects, notably through an executive order that scaled back some of the financial reforms of the Obama administration. But it\u2019s just the beginning. \u201cThe deregulation will likely relax financial oversight that is carried out under the Dodd-Frank Reform Act,\u201d says Roy. \u201cIn the short run, this kind of deregulation is likely to shore up share prices for banking stocks. The potential downside to this piece of legislation is that it can lead to [a] repeat of the mistakes that aggravated the 2008 financial crisis.\u201d Another area of deregulation: Relaxing the fiduciary rule that requires financial professionals to put their clients\u2019 interests first when giving advice on retirement investments. Roy says this might lead the asset managers toward excessive risk-taking by driving uninformed clients toward high-risk assets without proper understanding of the risks. Those are hardly on only industries that will be affected, say experts. The energy sector faces massive deregulation, and some see that as a good thing. \u201cDeregulation of [the] energy sector will help the country achieve complete independence from foreign sources of oil,\u201d says Prabir Chetia, who heads the business and research advisory department for Aranca, a research firm. \u201cAmerica will be able to tap the untapped energy \u2015 $50 trillion in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.\u201d That will lead to lower energy prices, he predicts. Chetia also expects the Food and Drug Administration to face significant deregulation, which would bring in new ways to vet drugs before commercial roll-out. \u201cOne idea is vetting new drugs through consumer reviews of medications,\u201d he says. But, he adds, it could easily backfire, potentially exposing patients to ineffective and potentially dangerous drugs. \u201cIt could be catastrophic,\u201d he says. Perhaps the biggest impact will be felt by customers of financial institutions as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is reformed, or possibly eliminated. As a reminder, the CFPB is tasked with administering important federal statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, as well as new responsibilities for consumer financial protection. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult argument to lessen the strength of a governmental entity looking out for consumers,\u201d says Braden Perry, a litigation, regulatory and government investigations attorney with Kennyhertz Perry, a law firm in Kansas City. \u201cBut it may happen.\u201d Perry predicts the underlying protections will either be redistributed to other agencies or the single-director CFPB will be replaced with a commission-style agency with congressional oversight. \u201cBut the CFPB is facing a serious reshaping,\u201d he says. Bottom line for consumers: The age of laissez faire deregulation has begun. During this time, you won\u2019t be able to turn to the government for help. You\u2019ll have to be more vigilant than ever \u2015 and you\u2019ll have to expect the worst as a consumer. If you tilt to the right politically, all this talk of deregulation may make your day. But the ramifications for consumers could be serious, and the negatives will almost certainly outweigh the positives, if the predictions are true. If the regulations go out the window, then ordinary consumers will lose an important ally with the power to create and maintain a fair, competitive marketplace. You don\u2019t have to be a political activist to shudder at the thought of credit cards with gotcha fees and confiscatory interest rates, of financial advisers working to enrich themselves instead of helping their customers, of drugs not properly vetted and of federal lands being drilled for oil.

Specializing in underground metal, and whatever else we feel like!\u201d A death metal vinyl shop huddled in the corner of a cute antique store in Patchogue? For some of the metalheads in the area, this was a talker.\u00a0The South Shore of Long Island is not exactly blast-beat country. But when two locals showed up to score some records last week, they found that the underground metal on offer included a lot of neo-Nazi records and the \u201cwhatever else\u201d included white nationalist band T-shirts. \u201cWe start leafing through everything, and about a quarter of the way through the first box, it became really apparent that the only thing they were selling was National Socialist black metal [NSBM],\u201d said one of the two, who asked that HuffPost withhold their names for fear of harassment. \u201cThere were scatterings of bands that weren\u2019t associated, but the vast majority was the very sketchy Nazi-related stuff. It was disgusting.\u201d Each offending item, they said, was instantly recognizable as belonging to fringe neo-Nazi bands or other groups not tolerated in polite metal circles. In photos of the T-shirts and records and in the owners\u2019 social media profiles, neo-Nazi iconography abounds\u00a0\u2014\u00a0wolf\u2019s hooks, black sunwheels, the hammer and sword, \u201ceverything short of a swastika.\u201d The pair immediately started digging online to figure out how this stuff found its way to Patchogue. They took their findings to the president of the Greater Patchogue Chamber of Commerce, James Skidmore. He was incensed, finding the pop-up and the small crew that put it together an affront not just to the metal community but to Suffolk County in general, which has some white supremacist baggage of its own. \u201cOur community has worked way too hard over the years to come to terms with what we are and who we are and to combat racism wherever it exists,\u201d Skidmore told HuffPost. \u201cSo to me this was a slap in the dick\u00a0\u2014 excuse me for saying. I was like, are you kidding me?\u201d Within hours of finding out on April 23, Skidmore said, he arrived at the antique shop that Heretic\u2019s Crypt called home to find a man\u00a0\u201cpacking his shit up and leaving.\u201d They had been kicked out by the antique shop\u2019s owner, who said he didn\u2019t know what they were selling beyond band merchandise and records. The weird little ode to white supremacy in Patchogue had been snuffed out within a matter of days. But now Skidmore and his community faced some tough questions: Who brought this here, and why is white supremacy showing its face publicly in Long Island again? \u201cThis is my major concern: They show up, they get the conversation going with music or whatever else, and then out comes a KKK party or a white nationalist movement,\u201d he said. With the help of friends on Facebook and the metal community at large, locals found one of the men who set up the shop: Paul Guhring, a local musician whose previous flings with neo-Nazis have landed him in hei\u00dfwasser. NYC Antifa profiled him in 2016 after his label, WolfTyr Productions,\u00a0brought various NSBM bands together for a show in Ronkonkoma. (For what it\u2019s worth, the show was \u201ca flop,\u201d he said.) Guhring, who spoke to HuffPost on Tuesday, fell back on the usual specious excuses when asked about the neo-Nazi symbolism on display at the pop-up and on his and his compatriots\u2019\u00a0various social media pages. \u201cThose are all from the esoteric pagan ideologies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily have to be about Nazis. I\u2019m not a racist. I have friends of all kinds, people that know me. In our circle of friends \u2015 I don\u2019t have that many friends, but \u2015 in our circle of friends, this is disputable.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a scholar in Nazi death metal to parse the T-shirts and records that Guhrig was selling. There were known NSBM bands like Hate Forest, Goatmoon, Grand Belial\u2019s Key and Heathen Hammer, whose promotional materials look as if they ripped off the\u00a0Nazi symbolism Wikipedia page: Black sunwheels,\u00a0nods to Nazi phrases like \u201cblood and soil\u201d and other well-known neo-Nazi imagery were on full display.\u00a0There was even a shirt in baby size, featuring the band M8L8TH (below right). And if there\u2019s any doubt as to the general ideology of the fan base for M8L8TH and Grand Belial\u2019s Key, look no further than the audiences\u00a0at\u00a0their live recordings on YouTube. Nazi salutes are as prominent as fists in the air.\u00a0 Guhring acknowledged that some of the stuff in his collection was Nazi smut, but he denied being involved himself, at least ideologically. Sure, the people around him might be throwing up Hitler salutes, and his favorite artwork has represented Nazism for decades, and his former band Grafvolluth\u00a0very publicly identified as National Socialist,\u00a0and his label promoted white supremacist groups like Pennsylvania\u2019s Wotanorden,\u00a0but don\u2019t get the wrong idea,\u00a0he said. \u201cPeople can take it any way they like. After all, it\u2019s a free country,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cJust because neo-Nazis hijacked certain symbols for themselves \u2015 and they\u2019re going to keep doing it, of course \u2015 it does indeed have its old ancestral roots.\u201d He lamented that he opened up shop in the first place. He and another man who helped set up Heretic\u2019s Crypt,\u00a0Buddy Zajac Mayoka, deleted their Facebook pages after the outcry last week, and now, Guhring said, his label is offline, and he has no plans for any shows or other commercial enterprises. \u201cI really wish we didn\u2019t do it at all, to tell you the truth \u2015 all the anger I\u2019ve caused people,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically my reputation is ruined because of this. Everything is stashed away in boxes and Hefty bags. It\u2019s done. We can\u2019t keep up with this.\u201d For Skidmore,\u00a0the shop scared up memories of Long Island\u2019s history of extremism. In the 1930s, Suffolk County was home to Camp Siegfried, a pro-Nazi summer camp, adjacent to a German colony in Yaphank that named its streets after Hitler and Goebbels. After the war, some of Hitler\u2019s relatives lived on Long Island. The Ku Klux Klan has always been active there. Long Island native Chris Cantwell, a white nationalist nicknamed \u201cthe Crying Nazi\u201d for a video in which he teared up at the thought of being arrested for his role in the Charlottesville, Virginia, mayhem, thought the area receptive enough to his views that he considered running for New York\u2019s 1st Congressional District. He\u00a0failed to get enough signatures\u00a0in his bid. Most recently, Skidmore recalled, an Ecuadorean immigrant was killed in 2008 in nearby Riverhead, where four teens admitted to being part of a gang that targeted Hispanics for hate crimes. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to get away from that. We want the message clear that hate is not welcome in Patchogue,\u201d Skidmore said. \u201cEven just a small pop-up. A little bit of cancer is still cancer.\u201d'}.

These incidents didn\u2019t just happen. This has been a systemic issue for years that, for many, has not been shown the light of day. While Hollywood is making headlines, sexual harassment, both overt and subtle, has taken place for years in corporate America.  On social media platforms, hundreds of thousands of women are raising their hands and saying #MeToo. Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson\u2019s newly released book, \u201cBe Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back\u201d is shining a bright light on workplace sexual harassment and identifying the problem not as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue\u201d but as a man\u2019s  issue as well, and one that will take the engagement of men to solve. Gender diversity experts are calling the national conversation ignited by the Harvey Weinstein scandal a \u201cwatershed moment.\u201d  Women do not go to work looking to be harassed. They want to show up, do valuable work and be treated with dignity and respect in a non-hostile workplace. Most companies and HR departments are ill-equipped to deal with these issues. Fewer than a one-third of cases of sexual harassment are ever reported, and fewer than one-third of those are prosecuted.  While the approach of many men is still choosing secrecy and \u201cnot wanting to get involved,\u201d a small but critical mass of men are speaking up and asking, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d  In my work with YWomen, I help companies advance women by engaging men in the conversation. Companies that are making the boldest steps to create a gender equitable workplace are often following these four steps: Listen, Learn, Lead and Have the Will to Change. These same strategies can be applied to ensure that your organization is in a place that does not tolerate sexual harassment.  Progressive organizations today are seeking solutions on how to attract, retain and advance women. Many men \u2014 I believe up to 30 percent \u2014 want to help. The challenge is knowing what to do on a daily basis to demonstrate advocacy.  Listen Genuinely listening to employee issues and concerns is the requisite first step to gaining understanding before diving into \u201cleading.\u201d To understand what is happening (or not happening) in your organization, it is imperative that senior leaders (typically men who comprise more than 85 percent of senior business leaders) ask women about their experiences and really listen to their answers. Carlson\u2019s book reminds us of the stunningly low rate of reporting sexual harassment in particular. According to the EEOC, she writes, 70 percent of women who experience sexual harassment at their jobs don\u2019t report it for fear it will cause negative repercussions, both personally and professionally. There are systemic issues in your company that are prohibiting growth, retention and development of all employees, impeding engagement and affecting your company\u2019s reputation in the marketplace. You don\u2019t know unless you ask. Learn All leaders, especially senior leaders, must deepen their knowledge of workplace harassment. Do you know what legally qualifies as sexual harassment or a hostile work environment? Many leaders may not know that if they witness or are told of an incident of sexual harassment, they have a responsibility to report it, and failure to do so could mean repercussions for them. Leaders and managers need to know that their jobs could be in jeopardy if they choose to ignore a situation or \u201cnot get involved.\u201d  Leaders also need to be able to articulate the business case for advancing women. Leaders must understand how advancing women in their organization affects revenue, company reputation and talent acquisition and retention. They should also be learning about unconscious bias and discrimination against women in the workplace, what it looks like to include and advance women and why it is critical to the future of their organization to do so. Lead Leadership starts at the top of organizations with visible, vocal leadership. Think about this: You are only as good as your worst manager. If you have just one manager/leader committing sexual harassment, you need to be prepared to be front-page news. Uber is the perfect example. I don't think Travis Kalanick went to bed knowing he would lose the company he founded as the result of a heinous behavior by a middle manager \u2014 and in Uber\u2019s case, HR was also culpable in the cover-up. Have the Will Sadly, we know the  men who tell off-color jokes, treat women as second-class citizens and perpetrate sexual harassment. Too many men are willing to just ignore the situation. It\u2019s time for men to stand up. Having the Will means speaking up and calling out other men. If it personalizes this situation, think about a simple fact,  Picture that thought. And now remember the number from above: One-third of women in the workplace experience some type of harassment. If this isn\u2019t enough for men to be outraged and choose to speak up, then I don\u2019t know what it will take. Simply put, it is time for all men to stand up, speak out and support women in the workplace. Using hashtags such as #MeToo, #IHearYou, #IWillSpeakUp and #HowIWillChange, men can begin to advocate for women in the workplace and ensure that all people can do valuable, meaningful work in a safe environment. In doing so, they are pledging to treat women with respect and challenge other men when they don't. It\u2019s not only our obligation as leaders, it\u2019s our obligation as sons, brothers, fathers and citizens!

Bitcoin\u2019s slide triggered a massive selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next-biggest, Ripple, plunging 33 percent. South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the \u201cirrational\u201d cryptocurrency investment craze. South Korea had said on Monday that its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalized, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market. Bitcoin slid on the latest news, trading as low as $11,191.59 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, down 18 percent on the day, for a short period putting the digital currency on track for its biggest one-day fall in three years. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting the cryptocurrency, with news around South Korea\u2019s further crackdown on trading the driver today,\u201d said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as \u201csubstantial\u201d amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. \u201cBut we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,\u201d he said. Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-biggest digital unit. The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down more than 40 percent from the record high around $20,000 it hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its \u201cmarket cap\u201d - the unit price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins that have been released into the market. The news from South Korea came as it emerged a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralized trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services, according to an internal memo from a government meeting seen by Reuters. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Chinese authorities plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading. \u2033(It) seems like it\u2019s uncertainty spooking the markets,...with regulations unclear,\u201d said Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare. \u201d(Traders) are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.\u201d A director at Germany\u2019s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community.

Chris Vickery, UpGuard\u2019s cyber risk research director, told HuffPost Tuesday he stumbled across the 36-gigabyte database during a routine search of Amazon Web Services\u2019 storage \u201cbuckets,\u201d which house data for various companies of all sizes. Anyone with a basic understanding of what keywords to look for and how to sift through vast amounts of data could have done the same, Vickery said. \u201cI\u2019m not the only person doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m certain there are bad guys doing it as well as good guys.\u201d As for the data itself: The file contains 123 million rows of data, one for just about every single household in the U.S. at the time of its likely creation in 2013. And each of those households is individually described via 248 specific categories. In addition to the data listed above (address, phone number, whether you\u2019re a dog or cat person, etc.), other categories include the number of children living in the house, and their age ranges and gender; what types of magazines you subscribe to; your mortgage amount; how old your car is; which causes you donate to; your ethnicity; and plenty more. While the database doesn\u2019t include individual names, Vickery said that\u2019s a moot point given everything else it contains. \u201cIt gets down to a level specific enough to be dangerous, although it does not have first [and] last names,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so simple to look up somebody\u2019s name if you have their address and their phone number.\u201d Given its personal nature, that information could be used for pretty damaging purposes, like circumventing what\u2019s known as \u201cknowledge-based authentication.\u201d \u201cWhen you buy a car these days, or you apply for a loan, or you\u2019re going for a student loan with the government or something, in order to verify who you are, a lot of times you run into knowledge-based authentication,\u201d Vickery explained. \u201cThat\u2019s where not only do you have to provide your name, address and Social Security number, but they\u2019ll also ask you, \u2018OK, where did you live five years ago, who owns the mortgage to your house\u2019 \u2015 all sorts of bits of data that only you are supposed to know.\u201d \u201cDatabases like this allow bad guys to have that information about large swaths of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo lots of fraud can be committed, even with systems that are designed to be based on personal knowledge.\u201d A central component of Alteryx\u2019s database, titled \u201cConsumerView,\u201d was provided by a company you probably\u00a0have heard of: Experian. Experian has a database with that exact name\u00a0that Alteryx incorporates into a license it sells for $38,995 a year. Reached for comment, Experian directed HuffPost to Alteryx. Alteryx didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cThis is an Alteryx issue,\u201d Experian said in a statement, noting that the data in question is used often in marketing. \u201cData security has always been, and always will be, our highest priority. As a matter of security best practices, Experian vets all our clients and mandates robust security measures and controls to secure our data.\u201d To be clear, Experian isn\u2019t responsible for this particular data breach, though it\u2019s certainly not a stranger to data breaches in general.\u00a0Experian supplied the data to Alteryx, and Alteryx failed to secure it. (Similarly, Alteryx likely wasn\u2019t at fault for a separate data breach earlier this year that exposed the personal information of almost all of America\u2019s 200 million registered voters. The database in that instance was stored as an Alteryx file type, suggesting it originated with the company, but the blame rests with the Republican data firm that\u00a0left it open to the public.) Regardless of who is at fault in this particular circumstance,\u00a0Vickery said all the companies that compile this type of data need to up their security game. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed that [Alteryx] would just leave it unencrypted out there for anybody, and that Experian would just give them a copy like that,\u201d he said. \u201cKeeping it open and in the clear is just asking for trouble.\u201d As for the consumers affected by this breach \u2015 which, again, is pretty much every American household\u00a0\u2015 there isn\u2019t much we can do except push for stronger regulations on the companies that compile this type of data. \u201cIf you\u2019re an American, your information probably was exposed,\u201d Vickery said.\u00a0 \u201cWe live in a new age,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to stay vigilant. You have to watch your financial accounts. You can\u2019t just assume you\u2019re not going to be a victim, because the bad guys have the knowledge, the information and the tools these days.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more a question of whether or not you\u2019re lucky rather than how protective you\u2019ve been,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve been very protective of your information, there\u2019s companies like Equifax that have your data. And even though you never gave it to them, they get breached all the time.\u201d\u00a0'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The game he is referring to was Saturday\u2019s 16-inning, nearly six-hour uber-marathon, which along the way featured a scintillating five minute umpire review. Baseball is a pastoral sport in a digital age. There\u2019s actually great appeal in that. But even Springsteen stops the show after three hours. Nobody wants to watch anything for six hours. Not even porn. As a Yankee fan, I adore catcher Gary Sanchez, but in the course of a game he visits the mound more than the dugout. Meanwhile, the batter scratches his thigh and plans his stepping-out-of-the-box strategy. Want to improve \u201cpace of game\u201d? Simply ban pitcher-catcher conferences except at the top of an inning or a pitching change. There\u2019s not a fan in the country who would complain. If pitchers and catchers insist that is not workable, then provide them with ear pieces so they could talk to each other during the game. Broadcast their conversation live. Hey, it\u2019s the 21st century. Privacy is dead, even in baseball. Oh, and about those full infield conferences. We all know there\u2019s no crying in baseball. Well, there are no huddles either. But nooooo, Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s genius move to shorten the game was to eliminate pitches thrown for intentional walks. Never mind that many games don\u2019t have intentional walks. Look on the positive side: Going forward, any game with ten intentional walks will now be two minutes shorter. Sweet relief! As any baseball fan knows, it\u2019s not just the length of the games destroying the sport, it\u2019s the start and end times. The seventh game of last year\u2019s World Series started on a Wednesday night, a few minutes after 8, and ended at 12:30. Even without the extra inning of play and 17-minute rain delay, the game would have ended around midnight. (In case you\u2019re wondering, the average length of a 2017 postseason game was nearly three and a half hours.) Conversely, this year\u2019s Super Bowl was played on a Sunday, started at 6:37 and, even with the extended halftime and overtime, was over by 10:30. Night baseball games should start no later than 7. And enough with these mind-numbing extra inning borefests. During the regular season, baseball is 9-innings period. After that, decide the game with a home-run derby. Already, I hear the traditionalists howling. Let them howl. Fans love the home-run derby. In fact, the recent all-star home-run derby was more highly rated on television than the all-star game itself. Give the people what they want, which is shorter games with more drama. While I\u2019m on the subject: No more playing Kate Smith\u2019s revolting rendition of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d during the 7th inning stretch at Yankee Stadium, not unless they are going to follow it with Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cThis Land Is Your Land.\u201d But no, that would add more time to the game. Ban Kate Smith. She was probably on steroids anyway. And speaking of cutting time between innings, relief pitchers should be prohibited from throwing warm-up pitches on the field. That\u2019s what the bullpen is for. Also, there is no reason for a manager to stroll out to the mound to make a pitching change. Make the change from the dugout, get the new guy in there. And commercials: cut one thirty-second spot between innings and, viola, you have just cut at least eight minutes per game. Baseball is the only team sport without a clock, something I used to love. But now I want a pitch clock. Throw the freakin\u2019 ball! To the batter. Not the first baseman! How many pick-off attempts does a man have to watch before you can call him a fan?  As for umpire reviews: The guys in the booth have 90 seconds. If they can\u2019t figure it out by then, the ruling on the field was close enough. I can\u2019t take much more of this. If none of the above works, then drastic times call for drastic measures. Two strikes and you\u2019re out? Three fouls after two strikes and you\u2019re out? Seven inning games? None of this could be ruled out because the six-hour, extra-inning death march can no longer be tolerated. As Captain Picard once said, \u201cThe line must be drawn here.\u201d My next move would be to designate fans as fielders. Then, any ball, fair or foul, caught by a fan would be an out. This would not only have the advantage of shortening games, but would encourage exciting competition between fans. For example, Yankee fans at Fenway Park would want to make sure that a homer hit by Aaron Judge was not caught by a Red Sox fan and ruled an out. What a great idea!

In a statement sent to The Huffington Post, he wrote:\u00a0 I have just read Susan Fowler\u2019s blog. What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in. It\u2019s the first time this has come to my attention so I have instructed Liane Hornsey our new Chief Human Resources Officer to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.

Her criticism comes as the company continues to deal with the fallout over Kalanick holding a since-relinquished role on President Donald Trump\u2019s business advisory board. The company also faced accusations of sexual misconduct last year. Last March, a report charged that Uber had received thousands of customer complaints about rape and sexual assault\u00a0from riders between December 2012 and August 2015. The company argues that rape allegations represented just 0.0000009 percent of customer journeys during that time, and that sexual assault claims occurred in one in every 3.3 million trips. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson has also called on Uber to start releasing a workplace diversity report amid concerns that it employs few women and ethnic minorities.

In a conference call with staff on Wednesday, reported on by The Wall Street Journal, CEO David Brandon said the company would file the papers ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing Thursday. \u201cI have always believed that this brand and this business should exist in the U.S.,\u201d Brandon told employees. The CEO blamed the liquidation on a number of factors, including vendors who didn\u2019t support the company during the crucial holiday season and customers who choose to shop elsewhere. They \u201cwill all live to regret what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Brandon said. A representative for Toys R Us on Wednesday confirmed the Journal\u2019s report and noted that there would not be an immediate shut down.\u00a0 Administrators for the retailer also said Wednesday that the company plans to close all 75 remaining stores in the United Kingdom,\u00a0which will affect roughly 3,000 workers. The big box retailer, which has some 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores around the world, filed for bankruptcy\u00a0in September over $5 billion in long-term debt. The company said the debt had prevented it from investing to compete in what it called\u00a0\u201can increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide.\u201d The company missed payments to several suppliers in recent days, Bloomberg reported, prompting some to speculate that liquidation was likely on the horizon. The toy chain is already in the process of closing down about 180 of its more than 800 U.S. stores. A CNBC report\u00a0Wednesday cited people familiar with the situation who said the retailer was working on a proposal to keep about 200 stores open even after the liquidation. The plan may include selling the company\u2019s Canadian operations, along with roughly 200 of the company\u2019s most profitable U.S. stores, to a new buyer, according to CNBC.'}.

The phone rings non-stop. Meetings run overtime. And construction outside his office building puts an enthusiastic environment on edge.  Interestingly, Schrager, the entrepreneur who conceived and co-owned Studio 54 in the '70s and then redefined the hotel industry in the '80s, appears relaxed. Dressed in jeans and a gray henley with Adidas, Schrager looks youthful and is filled with more energy than half the men his age. At 71, Schrager is still driven to create. He says his constant need for reassurance that he is doing a good job keeps him striving for perfection.  \"I still crave the next challenge,\" Schrager says. \"It's not the financial reward that drives me. I think, 'What's the next thing I can do to blow everybody away?' Entertainers on stage love the adulation. For me, it's very personal and very private.\"  Schrager's current challenge is Public, a hotel in New  York's Lower East Side that opened in June. Schrager calls Public the most important idea he has ever had and says it may be the best hotel he's ever done. With rooms at an affordable rate--starting at $150 a night--Schrager says with Public he wants to create a one-of-a-kind experience that lifts spirits and makes hearts beat faster.  \"I want people to feel they are part of something special in Public,\" Schrager says. \"Luxury before was for a small group of people. You don't have to be rich to have a luxury experience.\"  If anyone knows how to create an experience, it's Schrager. Growing up in Brooklyn, Schrager went on to study law at Syracuse University because, as he says, he really didn't know what he wanted to do. In the early 1970s, Schrager became fascinated by the nightclub business after seeing people waiting in lines to get into clubs.  \"That was a fascinating time in New York. Everybody was going out. Nobody had anything to lose. It wasn't dominated by a bunch of wealthy, Wall Street guys. It was a different city,\" Schrager says.  In 1977, Schrager and his best friend and business partner, Steve Rubell, opened the famed Studio 54 in New York City. It was one of the biggest, most-celebrated nightclubs of all time. For all who stepped through the now mythical velvet rope, an adult playground waited. On any given night, Studio 54 attracted entertainment A-listers including Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, and Diana Ross.  In the pre-AIDS era, inhibitions ran wild as clubgoers partied the night away. Forty years later, the legend of Studio 54 remains at the forefront of pop culture, and Schrager's memories are still as vivid as a disco ball. \"It was the human ideal of having complete freedom,\" Schrager says. \"I think when you went to Studio at night, it was the closest you could come to having complete freedom. You felt protected. Everyone was experimenting. That idea of complete freedom is something we all dream about.\"  In 1980, freedom ended for Schrager and Rubell when they were sent to prison for tax evasion. Embarrassed by how it all ended, Schrager says for the longest time Studio 54 was something he wanted to bury. Schrager says only after being pardoned by President Obama this past January, has he been able to have closure. Embracing and reclaiming his legacy, Schrager recently released a book on Studio 54 with a slew of photographs and personal stories. After serving 13 months in federal prison, Schrager and Rubell turned their attention to the hotel industry. In 1984 they opened Morgans, introducing the concept of the boutique hotel. By the late 1980s, the duo was the largest private hotelier in New York. But for Rubell the party once again came to end. In 1989, at 45 years old, Rubell died of AIDS.  Rubell's death was one more heartbreak for Schrager. At 20 years old, he lost his father to cancer. When he was 25, his mother died of a heart attack. Through each tragedy, Schrager picked himself up and pressed on.  \"If you lose enthusiasm, you lose it all,\" Schrager says.  Schrager's thirst for life remains intact. He says he has a good marriage and calls his five children, ranging in ages from 7 to 22 years old, his proudest achievement. Schrager says he doesn't expect his children to follow in his footsteps, but he does insist they work hard. \n \n\"They have to contribute,\" says Schrager. \"They don't have to be motivated by money, but they have to make some kind of contribution or they won't enjoy life.\" As Schrager sits in his office with photographs from his past and present surrounding him, he reflects on what he'd say to his 30-year-old self who opened Studio 54. \"I would say, enjoy the success more. It's been a wild ride. It's taken me down a lot of unknown paths,\" Schrager says. \"There is no destination. It's just a trip. Make sure you enjoy it.\"  For more on Public, visit www.publichotels.com'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

In January 2016, the company announced it had raised over $33 million to provide light and renewable energy sources to refugees living in camps across the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Ikea\u2019s partnership with the U.N. to develop a safer and more durable refugee housing unit dubbed the \u201cBetter Shelter\u201d won the company two major 2016 design awards from the Design Museum of London. Lars Petersson, Ikea\u2019s U.S. country manager, called President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration \u201cso troubling\u201d in a note sent to employees on Monday. Peterson\u2019s memo promised free legal advice to any employee affected by the controversial order, which indefinitely blocks Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. and temporarily restricts immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cAny proposal that would discriminate against a certain group of our customers or co-workers, or limit our ability to attract and retain diverse talent is so troubling,\u201d Peterson wrote. \u201cWe are committed to continuing to stand for the dignity and rights of everyone.\u201d Ikea joins several major corporations that have come out in support of refugees in the wake of Trump\u2019s travel ban. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced on Sunday that the company would hire 10,000 Syrian refugees in its stores across the world over the next five years. Airbnb is providing free housing to \u201crefugees and anyone not allowed in the U.S.,\u201d co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky tweeted Saturday. Google also pledged Saturday to donate $2 million to a \u201ccrisis fund,\u201d with the hope that employees would raise $2 million more, to benefit organizations that provide services to those affected by the executive order.'}.

Last week the Chinese chief energy planning agency, the National Energy Administration (NEA) concluded its annual work session with a plan for  for a whopping 50 billion m\u00b3 coal-to-gas (CTG) output target for 2020. According to the NEA, if the target is carried out, CTG could supply one-eighth of China's gas consumption by the end of this decade. The problem is, in reality this just means more coal consumption -- which means more catastrophic air pollution. Throughout 2013, the Chinese government gave an unprecedented set of green lights to 15 CTG applications. To put that in context, a grand total of 4 approvals existed before last year. All these projects are expected to convert coal into synthetic natural gas (SNG) through various gasification processes. The reason? Coal industry advocates, want to solve the severe air pollution through the substitution of coal to gas. The problem of course is that this is the same old wine just in a new bottle. Under the guise of \"addressing air pollution\" these plans will do nothing more than increase the problem -- the consumption of coal. Ironically, it is exactly the same coal companies that contribute most to air pollution that are now selling the \"silver bullet\" of CTG as a solution to the problem they themselves create. As a matter of fact, CTG will neither stem China's growing air pollution crisis, nor upgrade its energy infrastructure. Instead it will further lock China to its coal addiction - with a whole set of new environmental risks. CTG entails significant carbon emissions, water consumption, as well as air and water pollution. If the 2020 CTG target is met, 12 billion tons of CO2 will be emitted over the 40 year timespan of these projects -- close to two years of China's total CO2 emissions.  The water impacts are potentially more concerning.  China is already facing a coal and water crisis given the enormous water withdrawals the coal industry requires. According to  one study, one cubic meter of SNG requires 6 to 10 liters of water to produce. The target will therefore exacerbate China's water conflict by adding 300-500 million tons of water consumption yearly. Considering 77 percent of the approved capacity will operate in water stressed regions, this huge pipeline of CTG projects are simply unaffordable to China's dry west. In the long run the NEA's plan could fundamentally re-shape the geographic layout of coal production and the growth trajectory of the whole sector. The target would imply coal consumption of about 160-180 million tonnes per year. This might not sound like a huge addition given China's enormous appetite for coal, but consider that half of the CTG projects approved are located in Xinjiang, China's far western autonomous region with abundant yet largely untouched coal reserves. The CTG target will certainly unleash a local coal development rush in an ecologically fragile place, where the current water consumption rate has already gone beyond the provincial water allocation cap. If left unchecked, the gradually declining consumption of coal in China's eastern economic powerhouse will rapidly turn west. China will miss its opportunity to truly optimize its energy and economic structure and diversify away from coal. The catastrophic air pollution China experienced in 2013 has proven China's decades-old coal obsession is simply unsustainable. The result was a set of ambitious air pollution control plans to slash coal consumption. The coal industry seems set on rebranding its toxic product in \"new bottles.\" Failing to recognize it as such will only undermine China's important steps to reign in this crisis.'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Chemically Sensitive Find Sanctuary In Fragrance-Free Churches', body='KIRKLAND, Wash. -- The Rev. Kara Markell, pastor of Lake Washington Christian Church, recalled how \"unbreathable\" it often became inside her previous church in Texas.  Sunday best, for some people, includes ample amounts of smell-nice. The idea that perfumes may pose health risks may never cross the mind. But nestled in the woods of a Seattle suburb, Markell's new parish offers a sanctuary from scents. A fragrance-free campaign asks members and visitors to forego perfumes, after-shave and scented lotions on Sundays. Meanwhile, the church is swapping out perfumed products throughout the building, including cleaners, candles, air fresheners and bathroom soaps.  \"I love it,\" said Markell. Cleaner air that gives a reprieve to chemical-sensitive churchgoers ties in with her congregation's \"green church\" designation as well as its position on \"inclusion.\" Centuries of men and women have sought out sweet scents for the pleasure of themselves and others. Perhaps nowhere is that more evident than a church sanctuary filled with fragrant candles and a cocktail of colognes. As a verse in the Bible's book of Proverbs reads, \"Ointment and perfume delight the heart.\" But at the time the Bible was written, scents were basic, like pure frankincense and myrrh. Today, they're likely an undisclosed mixture of petrochemicals. Modern chemical fragrances are also incorporated into a long list of products, from detergents and deodorants to dryer sheets and hair sprays.\n\nThe pervasiveness of synthetic scents, according to experts, threatens the health of many people -- whether they realize it or not. While a small fraction of Americans are hypersensitive to scents, many may be subtly affected and at increased risk of future health problems from living in an invisible fog of chemicals. Fragrance is just one piece of the problem, they say, with chemical ingredients that can include carcinogens, neurotoxins and hormone disruptors. \"Almost everything we use has chemical scent added,\" said Joseph Heimlich, an expert in environmental education and community involvement at The Ohio State University. \"What does clean smell like? It doesn't,\" Heimlich added. \"But we've been conditioned through media and society that it should smell like lemons or mountain fresh.\" The fragrance industry asserts the benefits of scents, whether natural, man-made, or designed to smell like nature. \"These products contribute to our overall quality of life and well-being,\" Elena Solovyov, a spokeswoman for the International Fragrance Association, an industry trade group, told The Huffington Post.  \"Consumers can be assured that the fragrance used in their favorite products is safe,\" Solovyov said, noting that individual ingredients are \"evaluated for consumer and environmental safety\" and that products are \"tested according to all government and company-specific requirements.\" The fragrance industry sets its own standards and facilitates its own safety reviews, with help from outside experts. That's little comfort for people who find it unbearable to venture inside churches, workplaces, schools, or even the grocery store.   \"There are people out there who would like to go to church, but they can't,\" said Gina Blum, an elder at Lake Washington Christian Church, who spent weeks compiling a list of products and their disclosed ingredients to help identify the safest alternatives for the church and its members. Blum said she is mildly sensitive to scents. Linda Moreno, another member with mild sensitivity, said her daughter, Kelsey, 22, can't even walk past someone wearing perfume on the street without getting sick. Moreno called Kelsey's hypersensitivity multiple chemical sensitivity -- a controversial condition. The American Medical Association studied it in 1991, but \"found no scientific evidence that supports the contention that multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a significant cause of disease,\" R.J. Mills, an AMA spokesperson, told HuffPost.  Until \"accurate, reproducible, and well-controlled studies are available,\" Mills said, the AMA believes that \"multiple chemical sensitivity should not be considered a recognized syndrome.\" Dr. Philip Ranheim, an environmental medicine doctor based in Lake Stevens, Wash., who has dealt with chemical sensitivity issues himself, said the controversy will likely continue. \"There's not a lot of money and time and effort going into defining it more fully,\" said Ranheim, who attends a church unable to address his condition.  \"Other countries such as England and Japan have had government-associated environmental centers for studying chemical sensitivity. But there's bias against it in this country,\" Ranheim added. \"I think we're addicted to chemicals and some people don't want to admit there's a downside to it.\" A review of research published in May concluded that one significant exposure, or the accrual of repeated low-level exposures, seems to overload and impair the body's ability to tolerate chemicals. At that point, \"minute amounts of diverse everyday chemicals\" can trigger symptoms. The larger the total body burden of toxins, suggests the review, the greater the degree of hypersensitivity.  Studies in the early 2000s estimated that 12 percent to 16 percent of Americans are hypersensitive to chemicals.  \"I think the numbers are increasing. It's becoming an epidemic,\" said Anne Steinemann, a co-author on one of those studies and a visiting researcher at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.  Her response when she first heard of Lake Washington Christian Church's campaign to address chemical sensitivity: \"Hallelujah.\" \"To some extent, we're all affected by chemicals,\" Steinemann added. In fact, those with acute symptoms, such as migraine headaches, asthma attacks, heart palpitations or skin rashes after exposures, may act as proverbial canaries in the coal mine when it comes to toxic chemicals and their subtle or future effects on others, according to some experts interviewed by HuffPost. But avoiding chemical fragrances, they added, is made difficult by their pervasiveness and by scant regulation.  Solovyov, the fragrance industry spokeswoman, confirmed there is \"no official definition\" for the industry terms \"unscented\" or \"fragrance-free.\" The former can include fragrance ingredients that actually mask odors. She also said fragrance formulas are protected as \"trade secrets.\" Ingredients are rarely disclosed. Even full disclosure of chemicals \"offers little information on their ultimate toxicity,\" according to Steinemann. \"The solution is to use truly natural or simple products -- like our grandparents used -- vinegar, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, lemon juice (from a real lemon),\" she said. \"People with fragrance sensitivities usually don't react to aromatic flowers, fruits, or other truly natural smells,\" added Steinemann. \"It's often claimed that fragrance chemicals, such as limonene, are 'natural.' But there is a difference between the limonene as found in an orange and limonene made in a lab.\" Janine Ridings of Bellevue, Wash., became housebound after an extreme exposure to jet fuel fumes in 1998. A short while later, she began an online prayer group, Aroma of Christ, to provide fellowship and encouragement for others dealing with multiple chemical sensitivity. Ridings said she has been fortunate that a couple local churches accommodated her needs with everything from fragrance-free, windowed rooms outside the sanctuary to air freshener-free restrooms. \"If churches could just get air fresheners out of restrooms, that would help a lot,\" she said.  Lake Washington Christian Church made that step. And the church's fragrance-free efforts continue. This month, the church held a screening of the environmental documentary, \"Chemerical,\" which explores the dangers of chemicals to clean our bodies and homes, and offers recipes for toxic-free alternatives. The film's producer, Andrew Nisker, recommended first targeting laundry and dishwashing detergents, which he suggested have some of the worst health and environmental impacts.  Nisker has produced a cookbook of make-your-own cleaning products. The Environmental Working Group, meanwhile, offers a free database and guides to help identify the least toxic and fragrance-free personal care and cleaning products on the market.  \"Policy is not going to change unless people change, and stop buying products full of toxins,\" Nisker told HuffPost. Consumer pressure may be responsible for announcements this fall from Target and Walmart. Both big box stores said they will begin rating products based on suspect chemicals. This week, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Lysol, Woolite and Airwick, reported plans to disclose chemicals in its fragrances.  Raising awareness in the religious community may be a powerful avenue for further change, said Nisker. \"A lot of politics, whether we like it or not, has influenced policy for good or for bad. And there's a lot of religion in politics,\" he said. Ohio State's Heimlich agreed that churches are key venues for environmental progress. \"Churches are often a place where people are paying attention to things they may not pay attention to elsewhere,\" Heimlich said. \"If something comes to them from the pulpit, or the alter -- from that authority -- they'll hear it in a way they won't hear it from newspaper, radio, TV or from someone else.\" \"Also, in a religious community, you are caring about the other people in that community,\" Heimlich added. \"Cleaning your environment cleans it for everyone else too.\"'}.

William and Robert Tierney ran or were involved in nine different PACs that collected small donations solely to enrich themselves,\u00a0prosecutors with the Southern District of New York allege in a criminal complaint. The supposed PACs collected $23 million from 2014-2017 and routed the vast majority of the funds through a series of shell companies that either directly enriched the Tierneys or continued the fundraising scheme, the complaint says.  Most of the so-called PACs\u2019 fundraising appeals allegedly targeted conservatives with promises to support law enforcement, oppose Planned Parenthood, advocate for pro-life policies and promote smaller government.\u00a0But prosecutors say they did none of those things. \u201cThe defendants, as alleged, capitalized on the sympathy and activism of those who sought to support awareness of various causes near and dear to their hearts,\u201d FBI Assistant Director William Sweeney Jr. said in a statement. The charges brought by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan are so far the most high profile effort by federal law enforcement to crack down on operators of scam PACs. Scam PACs have emerged over the last decade as a new field for fraudsters to trick people, often the elderly, into giving up their money. This phenomenon emerged as campaign money boomed following a series of deregulatory court decisions and a declaration from the Federal Election Commission that it did not have the legal authority to crack down on scams. In July 2015, then-FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel wrote a column for Roll Call explaining that \u201cthe law doesn\u2019t give the FEC the tools or the authority needed to address scam PAC activity.\u201d In fact, prosecutors say, this article caught the eye of William Tierney, as it mentioned one of his supposed PACs.\u00a0The complaint details an email in which he expressed concern to an unnamed co-conspirator that perhaps the PAC should spend more on politics to throw regulators off the scent. But prosecutors say the co-conspirator dismissed the concern: \u201cThe reality is that to these people there will be little difference between 0% and 5%.\u201d Scam PACs almost always operate in a similar fashion. The founders take a cause or a candidate popular with elderly donors, say former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) or former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West, and spend money on telemarketing and direct mail to raise money. Those donations are then paid to the founders and also cycled back into further fundraising. Sometimes the scammers even own the firms doing the telemarketing. Thursday\u2019s complaint against the Tierney brothers, which is based on their subpoenaed emails, phone records and work documents, details precisely how this type of alleged scam works.\u00a0Prosecutors allege as follows: The Tierneys set up six PACs \u2015 Grassroots Awareness PAC, Americans for Law Enforcement PAC, National Campaign PAC, Voter Education PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC \u2015 and controlled three others called Life and Liberty PAC, Republican Majority PAC and RightMarch.com PAC. All were registered in other people\u2019s names. For the PACs the brothers founded,\u00a0a third, unnamed co-conspirator signed on as the treasurer using a middle name. (FEC records show the name Ann Mattson.) Each PAC promoted advocacy on a particular issue that might attract small donations. Grassroots Awareness PAC claimed to be \u201cdedicated to raising awareness and advocating on behalf of children with autism spectrum disorder and other important health issues affecting Americans.\u201d Americans for Law Enforcement PAC said that it \u201cbuilds support nationwide for local law enforcement.\u201d Voter Education PAC supposedly promoted \u201cindividual liberty, smaller government, traditional values, economic opportunity, a strong national defense and energy independence.\u201d\u00a0National Campaign PAC, Action Coalition PAC and Protect Our Future PAC all targeted abortion opponents. To obscure the involvement of the alleged profiteers, each PAC paid money to a series of phony shell companies, which prosecutors say William Tierney referred to as \u201cStealth LLCs.\u201d In some cases, these were simply LLCs created to look like consulting firms that actually paid money directly to the scammers. In other cases, William Tierney told the telemarketing firms he worked with to create separate LLCs for each PAC they worked with to obscure the payments. William Tierney allegedly provided an entire memo to the telemarketing firms detailing exactly how they should create these LLCs to \u201cestablish our privacy goals.\u201d The LLCs should be set up on different dates and by different people who should \u201cnot [be] someone easily discoverable on Google as being related to your company or each other.\u201d They shouldn\u2019t have a name that could identify them as related to the telemarketing firm or the PAC they would work for, he allegedly instructed. Prosecutors say William Tierney ultimately pocketed $3 million from the scam. His brother Robert allegedly received $600,000, while the co-conspirator allegedly took in $250,000.

One complaint, filed by a parent last August, expressed concerns that Volitich was injecting political bias into her middle school classroom. Another complaint, made anonymously, informed administrators of Volitich\u2019s Twitter alias, Tiana Dalichov, and of her racially incendiary musings online.\u00a0 Following those complaints, the district monitored Volitich\u2019s social media,\u00a0made more visits to her classroom and interviewed students. But at the time,\u00a0the kids did not substantiate the concerns about her teaching, and administrators did not notice anything out of line.\u00a0 Earlier this year, HuffPost informed the district of a podcast in which Volitich brags about bringing her political views into her social studies classes. Following the HuffPost report, Volitich was removed from the classroom and an investigation was begun. In April, Volitich formally resigned from her post. This week the results of the investigation were released and reported by the Citrus County Chronicle.\u00a0 The investigative report said that the inquiry had centered on whether Volitich violated \u201cprofessional practices by being deceptive in changing her teaching practices when administration enters her classroom and by encouraging her students to go along with the deception.\u201d Indeed, in a Feb. 26, 2018, podcast, Volitich said that when parents complained about her inserting her white nationalist opinions into her teaching, she lied to school administrators and said it wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0 The investigation found probable cause for disciplining Volitich. But because she has already resigned, the district will not be taking further action,\u00a0according to the report.\u00a0 Investigators interviewed 16 students and four other teachers. Most of the interviewed students had positive feelings about Volitich\u2019s class and her ability as an educator. Most also said that she had a habit of discussing her political views in class, but denied that they were told not to inform their parents or encouraged to change the topic when administrators visited.\u00a0 But five students said Volitich made them uncomfortable when she discussed topics like immigration, segregation, President Donald Trump and the Democrats. One student, who is biracial, told administrators that Volitich described the Ku Klux Klan as \u201ca good thing,\u201d called for immigration to be \u201cshut down\u201d and said segregation should be restored in schools.\u00a0Another student said that Volitich told the class that Democrats believe they need help raising pets or children, whereas Republicans don\u2019t believe they need help with such activities. Another said that Volitich would sometimes talk about how Hillary Clinton should be in jail and claim that Democrats want to raise your taxes. Of the four teachers interviewed, one expressed concern about Volitich injecting racial bias into her classroom practices and took issue with Volitich allegedly seating black male students together. The educator also described a tense conversation with Volitich about politics, in which the educator expressed fears that Trump would try to get rid of black people. In response, Volitich simply said, \u201cWell,\u201d\u00a0the educator alleges.\u00a0 The parent who had filed the complaint last August told investigators about new comments made to his son.\u00a0Volitich allegedly told the child that \u201cGoogle is down because the Democrats were busy helping to delete all Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mails.\u201d\u00a0 District officials did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the results of the investigation. Volitich\u2019s lawyer, Charles E. Moore, also did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Volitich\u2019s answer to the allegations is included in the investigative report. She took issue with the inquiry\u2019s results,\u00a0suggesting that media coverage might have primed students to remember more innocuous comments.\u00a0She also responded to many of the kids\u2019 specific claims. In response to the allegation that she said Democrats need help raising pets and children, Volitich said she was teaching students about the two major political parties.\u00a0Instead of arguing that Clinton belongs in jail, Volitich claimed that she said Clinton should be in jail if there is proof she committed a crime. Her comment about Google and Clinton\u2019s emails was a joke, she said.\u00a0 \u201cOver 85% of the students interviewed stated they learned a lot in my class, felt they were able to express their own opinions and views, denied my telling them not to talk to their parents about material discussed in class,\u201d Volitich wrote.

Those are box jellyfish. They are dangerous,'\" recalled Yanagihara, a biochemist at the University of Hawaii. \"But I looked at them and thought that was silly.\" Multiple box jellyfish stings landed her in an ambulance a short while later, and she admitted regretting her quick dismissal of the advice. Yet the ordeal, which culminated in \"three days of bedridden agony,\" redirected her research. She was determined to decode the mysterious sea creature's sting, and then find ways to protect other swimmers, fishermen and divers who might risk coming into contact with a potentially deadly jelly.  That risk may be rising, according to some experts, who hold the popular but controversial opinion that factors including discharge of sewage and plastics, overfishing and climate change are creating ideal conditions for the hardy gelatinous animals to proliferate. More than a half-billion years on Earth, they say, has provided the box jelly and its cousins with tools to handle the harshest environments and to exploit the misfortunes of other species that can't. \"Across the world, we're seeing more sinister types of jelly blooms, in oceans that have been under pressures from our own mismanagement and our own pollutants,\" said Yanagihara. Regardless of whether jellyfish are taking over our oceans -- a point of intense scientific debate -- researchers agree that the sea animals are worthy of more attention, research funding and public education.  \"Jellyfish blooms are a problem that needs to be dealt with, pronto,\" writes Lisa-ann Gershwin in her new book, Stung! On Jellyfish Blooms and the Future of the Ocean. \"We are more frequently using the oceans, putting our bodies and industries into the pathways of jellyfish blooms,\" Gershwin adds. \"But despite our increasing use of the sea, we have surprisingly few datasets about jellyfish.\" Every year, some 150 million people are exposed to jelly\ufb01sh around the world, according to the National Science Foundation. Most jellyfish stings are minor, but rare tentacle swipes from some types, such as the box jelly can inject life-threatening doses of poison. In fact, certain species of box jellies have been known to stop the heart of a healthy adult in less than three minutes. Yanagihara described the pain as the \"sensation of thousands of burning needles.\" She was fortunate to survive. An estimated 20 to 50 people annually are not so lucky in the Philippines, with the actual number likely to be far higher due to unreliable data, according to Gershwin. More locals and tourists lose their lives on the tropical coastlines in Australia, Thailand, India, China and Papua New Guinea, among other countries.  Deaths from Irukandji box jellies are particularly difficult to track. The sting itself often goes unnoticed and rarely leaves a mark. But about a half-hour later, a constellation of symptoms may develop, including muscle cramps, vomiting and hypertension. In severe cases that end in heart attack or drowning, a jellyfish may never be suspected.   The effects of jellyfish extend far beyond their sting, of course. Blooms have capsized fishing vessels, shut down nuclear reactors, clogged desalination plants, threatened an Olympic triathlon and devastated fisheries. Since the 1980s, according to the National Science Foundation, blooms of jellies have cost the world's fishing and tourism industries billions of dollars. Many fear the worst is yet to come. Jellyfish are more common than they used to be in many places, noted Mark Gibbons, a jellyfish expert at the University of Western Cape in South Africa. While we can't point a finger at any one culprit, he said, the \"coincidence is too great to be anything other than anthropogenic for most of those systems.\" Perhaps nowhere are box jellies more recognized than the coasts of northern Australia, which entered box jellyfish high season in October. Here, blooms of box jellies have long been an annual occurrence. But a 2012 study suggests rising sea surface temperatures mean an earlier arrival and later departure, and thus a longer season of danger for public health.  Robert Condon, a marine biologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, led a separate study in 2012 that concluded the apparent rise in swarms of jellies may simply be an artifact of natural waxing and waning of global jellyfish populations on cycles of about 20 years. His teams's analysis of data since the 1970s did show a slight increase over time, he said, but more waxing than waning phases were also represented in that time period. The studies call for more monitoring in order to get a better grip on what to expect of the slimy creatures in the decades ahead. \"In a lot of respects, issues of blooms are kind of irrelevant,\" said Condon. \"We know we go through rise and fall periods, so we should prepare for that what's happening during future rise periods.\"   Some South Korean scientists envision that preparation in the form of jelly-slaying robots. They are currently testing prototypes. But critics such as Condon warn that such a technology may actually have the potential to enhance a jellyfish bloom -- releasing the eggs and sperm and creating even more jellies. He recommends a thorough environmental impact study before any robots are set loose on the seas. Condon calls Yanagihara's new technology, meanwhile, \"really clever.\" Yanagihara has developed a dual-acting agent that blocks tentacles from shooting their toxic venom into the skin, while also providing treatment for stings -- just in case. The technology is the first that's designed for prevention, Yanagihara said, which is crucial in the case of fast-acting box jellyfish venom.  \"It's been effective for every species we've tested so far,\" said Yanagihara. The concoction is currently in the pipeline for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. Yanagihara said she ultimately hopes to have various versions, including sunscreen-like lotions and IV therapeutics, available to the public and out on the beaches for lifeguards and emergency care-givers. U.S. Army Special Forces, fisheries and others have already expressed interest, she added. World-renowned long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad used the salve during her record-breaking open water swim from Cuba to Florida in September. She suffered box jellyfish stings three times during earlier, unsuccessful attempts at the crossing. Yanagihara, like other experts, emphasized the importance of basic research and surveillance to help predict when and where dangerous jellies may appear. She has a study coming out soon based on 16 years of data from Hawaii, which she said finds that while waxing and waning, the overall trend has been of an increase in jellies. And she has started field surveys of jellyfish in the Northern Mariana Islands and the Caribbean.  \"Systems need to be in place to detect these things early,\" said Gibbons of the University of Western Cape. suggesting the benefits of someday being able to predict the pending presence of jellies based on, for example, wind patterns. \"But, at the moment, we're in a very poor position to be able to understand enough of the biology and the way jellyfish interact with the environment to build good models.\"  Citizens can help by reporting any jellyfish stings or sitings at JellyWatch.org. Cell phone apps are available. On Sept. 12, one beachgoer reported being stung by box jellyfish 10 days prior in Key West.  \"Wounds are still healing,\" wrote the contributor.

Here's Where To See It.', body='Scientists and space enthusiasts are preparing for a lunar event so rare that it only happens once in a blue moon \u2015 or, to be more specific, once in a super blue blood moon. People living in certain parts of the Western Hemisphere will be able to see a reddish and unusually large moon glowing on the celestial stage early in the morning on Jan. 31. NASA is calling it a \u201clunar trifecta,\u201d since it\u2019s a combination of three distinct events.\u00a0 First, the moon that morning will be a \u201csupermoon,\u201d since it\u2019s occurring near a perigee, or a time in the moon\u2019s orbit when it is closest to the Earth. This means that the moon will be about 14 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA. Secondly,\u00a0it is the second full moon of the month. Full moons are typically separated by 29 days. Usually, every calendar month only has one full moon, but sometimes, a second one squeezes in. When this happens, as it will on Jan. 31, the event is commonly referred to as a \u201cblue\u201d moon.\u00a0 But what will really make the Jan. 31 moon spectacular for some viewers is the fact that it will be happening during a total lunar eclipse. That means the moon will pass through the Earth\u2019s shadow and take on a reddish glow \u2015 which gives it the nickname \u201cblood moon.\u201d This is the second supermoon to light up the sky this January.\u00a0The first\u00a0occurred on Jan. 1, and was the biggest Americans will see year.\u00a0 The last time people in North America were treated to a blue moon occurring simultaneously with a total lunar eclipse was over 150 years ago, according to Space.com. The \u201csuper blue blood moon\u201d will be most visible to people on western part of North America, Alaska, and the Hawaiian islands,\u00a0according to Gordon Johnston, program executive and lunar blogger at NASA. People on the East Coast will not have as great a view, since the eclipse begins just as the moon is about to set and the sky is getting lighter. Johnston advises East Coasters who want to give moon viewing a chance to be outside at about 6:45 a.m. EST. It\u2019s best to head to a viewing point at a higher elevation, with a clear line of sight to the horizon toward the west. Americans living in the Central time zone will have a better view. The Earth\u2019s reddish shadow will be noticeable on the moon by about 6:15 a.m. CST.\u00a0\u00a0 The best viewing will be on the West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska. The eclipse begins at 3:48 a.m.\u00a0PST and will reach a peak between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. \u201cWeather permitting, the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii will have a spectacular view of totality [the eclipse] from start to finish,\u201d said Johnston.\u00a0 While the Jan. 31 lunar eclipse will be tough to see from some parts of the United States, there are other spectacular heavenly displays in store for Americans in the future. Johnston said another lunar eclipse will occur on Jan. 21, 2019, that will be visible throughout the country. Although that one will be a supermoon, it won\u2019t be a blue moon.\u00a0 So if you\u2019re on the West Coast, the \u201csuper blue blood moon\u201d may be worth waking up early for.\u00a0 \u201cSet your alarm early and go out and take a look,\u201d Johnston said.\u00a0\u00a0 Use this site to see when and how long the upcoming super blue blood moon will be visible near you.\u00a0 The Virtual Telescope Project will be livestreaming the eclipse here.\u00a0'}.

The advice stems from new polling provided exclusively to HuffPost from Women\u2019s Voices Women Vote Action Fund, Greenberg Research, and Democracy Corps. The polls, conducted by phone and web panel, surveyed more than 3,000 registered voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin \u2013 all states with contested governor and/or Senate races, as well as competitive House contests. \u201cDemocrats must not be distracted by the macro-economic and jobs-report numbers\u201d Republicans have been touting, pollster Stan Greenberg wrote in a memo, authored with Democracy Corps\u2019 Nancy Zdunkewicz and Page Gardner, president of the Women Voices Women Vote group. \u201cIt is a mistake to accept that GOP narrative and attribute credit to [former] President [Barack] Obama or insist it\u2019s despite [President Donald] Trump and Republicans.\u201d The memo added, \u201cVoters, especially Democratic voters, are genuinely struggling in this economy. They remain in pain because rising costs outpace any pay increases.\u201d The trio wrote that Democratic \u201cmomentum has stalled\u201d in recent months because the party has failed to focus on \u201cthe economic and health care battles that most engage anti-Trump voters,\u201d and because \u201cRepublican base voters, especially white working-class men, could finally point to a signature conservative policy achievement in the new tax cut law.\u201d\u00a0  4.30.18 Battleground Panel WVWVAF Memo by krobilla on Scribd The memo\u2019s authors urge Democrats groups to concentrate on turning out what they call the \u201cRising American Electorate,\u201d which consists of minority voters, millennials and single women \u2014 all key elements of the party\u2019s base. While turnout dipped among these groups in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections \u2015 in which the GOP scored big gains \u2015 the strategists are hopeful a backlash to\u00a0 Trump can spur a surge at the polls by such voters and lead to significant Democratic victories this November. While just 37 percent of members of the Rising American Electorate express heavy interest in voting when first asked in the recent polling, that jumps to 43 percent after they hear progressive messaging. Overall, 51 percent of Democrats said the midterms would \u201cmatter tremendously,\u201d compared with just 39 percent of Republicans. \u201cDemocrats sit at the edge of a landslide repudiation of President Trump and Republicans \u2015 in the Congress and states where they govern -\u2013 in November,\u201d the memo said. \u201cDemocrats have huge opportunities with minorities, millennials, and unmarried women, and even white working-class women, that will allow them to dominate across battlegrounds in 2018.\u201d The polling found that, by 50 percent to 42 percent, Democrats have the advantage in the generic ballot for Senate races on the ballot in 10 of the 12 battleground states surveyed. The results give Democrats smaller edges in gubernatorial and House, where the two parties are essentially tied. But in House races considered DCCC targets, Democrats have a 10-point advantage. Independent analysts give Democrats a good chance of winning a House majority in the midterm elections, while saying the odds are against the party taking control of the Senate.  4.30.18 Battleground Panel WVWVAF by krobilla on Scribd The memo suggests a shift in Democratic messaging as campaigning ramps up for the November vote.

In addition to a preference for city living, most Americans under the age of 35 say they don\u2019t have enough money saved for a down payment, which is about 20 percent of the home sales prices. The good news is that there are a few states that make the dream of homeownership possible. According to a new report from GoBankingRates, West Virginia is the best state for millennials wanting to buy a home. \u00a0Using the median millennial income of $60,932, the personal finance site calculates that young buyers should be able to afford a $150,00 home (the median list price) with a $693 monthly mortgage payment. GoBankingRates predicts that millennials could come up the 20 percent down payment within 2.5 years. Millennials living in Ohio also have a good shot at buying a home. The study predicts that buyers should be able to snag a $154,900 house with a $704 monthly mortgage payment after saving for 2.5 years. Rounding out the top three affordable states is Arkansas, where millennials will need to save for about 2.7 years in order to pay the 20 percent down payment. After that, the median list price for a home is $164,900 with a monthly mortgage payment of $757. As is the case with millennials, what they want is different than what they can afford. Colorado and California are both popular states for people under 35, featuring robust music scenes, good food and legalized recreational marijuana use. At the same time, they are two of the worst places to buy a home. \u00a0 In Colorado, the median list price is $408,068, with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,780. In order to buy a home, the average millennial earning $60,932 will have to save money for 6.7 years in order to afford the down payment. Over in California (the second worst state to buy a home) the median list price for a home is $499,950, with a monthly mortgage payment of $2,168. With prices like this, it will take the average millennial 9.8 years to save for the down payment.Still neither city holds a candle to Hawaii, the worst state for millennials to buy a home. Believe it or not, the median list price for a home is $599,000, making the monthly mortgage payment a whopping $2,584. It will take most young buyers nearly a decade, 9.8 years, to save for the down payment. Tougher financial obstacles mean that more millennials are renting longer in urban environments. Still, there is hope that those under the age of 35 will get their shot at the American dream. According to Ellie Mae, a software company, nearly 42 percent of first-time homebuyers are millennials, the largest group of any generation. \u00a0 Brittany Jones-Cooper is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.\u00a0 Read more from Yahoo Finance: This story was originally published on Yahoo Finance.'}.

But first he\u2019d need to know a little more about how he ended up stranded on a deserted island with an elite QB in the first place: \u201cWhy would I be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback?\u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s my escape route? We flying off? We on a boat?\u201d In the end, the 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee, two-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro Bowler and historically great\u00a0former Broncos running back said he\u2019d have to go with Wilson because \u201che\u2019s mobile\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s all sorts of situations he\u2019s able to get himself out of.\u201d Davis, 45, talked about that, player safety, anthem protests and more in an interview with HuffPost on Thursday morning. Davis was speaking to reporters as part of a promotional push for Verizon\u2019s new rewards program, VerizonUp. (Note: Verizon owns HuffPost\u2019s parent company, Oath.) The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and transcribed below: HuffPost: Let\u2019s say tomorrow you wake up, and you\u2019ve been named NFL commissioner, with the absolute power to change anything in the league. What\u2019s the first thing you\u2019d do?\u00a0 Davis: I would go back to giving teams more time to practice. More time for padded practices, more time to develop players. They\u2019ve really taken it away from the players \u2015 and a lot of that has been done by the NFL Players Association \u2015 but it\u2019s kind of cheating the players in their development. Training camp is important. The way we\u2019re preparing players coming out of college. Especially the offensive linemen and running backs, in trying to get the running game going, you need actual practice in pads. It\u2019s hard to really get that running game going when you\u2019re just doing simulated drills or you\u2019re doing walk-throughs. I know what it meant to me to get those reps in, and I\u2019m sure it would benefit a lot of other players. What\u2019s stopping NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell or the NFLPA from doing that? It all comes back to players\u2019 safety, and I think the one thing that hurts it is you have some coaches who abuse it, and that\u2019s why they installed it initially. You had some coaches who were practicing super long \u2015 two practices a day with pads on. I\u2019m not sure how you could bring that back and try to make sure that it\u2019s not being abused and that it\u2019s being used properly.\u00a0 If you could time travel, what advice would you give yourself before your first preseason game in 1995, when you were pretty sure you wouldn\u2019t make the team? Just be ready for the opportunity. When it comes, it\u2019s going to come. I can\u2019t tell you when, but when it comes \u2015 be ready. I know you fought through migraines in the past. Are you worried about chronic traumatic encephelopathy\u00a0at all and how CTE might affect you in the future? Yeah, I think you certainly have to be.\u00a0This sport is relatively new, and we\u2019re just now starting to see players getting older, getting their brains examined and having signs of CTE, so why would I think that I\u2019m in the clear? There are things that have happened in my life where I might forget something, and, of course, my first thought is, \u201cIs this from playing football or am I getting older?\u201d And I\u2019m not sure. I have a wife and three kids, and you\u2019re always concerned about your health. Are you going to be around when they get older? Yeah, I think about it. I do know that [when I played] 18 years ago, I thought I wouldn\u2019t let my kids play football. I\u2019ve changed my tune for a number of reasons: One, the sport has changed and the awareness is there. If you get dinged and you see stars, you now have to go through the proper protocol, so I like what they\u2019re doing with that. Going back to the grassroots, people growing up playing football are taught differently. The equipment is better. Techniques are being taught differently in terms of where your head should be placed. They don\u2019t hit as much on all levels. Everything they\u2019ve done to decrease the chances of head collisions I\u2019ve been happy with.\u00a0 Both of my sons play flag football, and they want to play tackle. And when it\u2019s time to play tackle, I\u2019m going to let them play. What would you tell NFL players who are concerned about CTE and are looking at their future, thinking of leaving the league early? The first thing to do is look at what their history is. If they have a history of concussions, then I can\u2019t tell anybody to continue to play. It\u2019s really an individual decision. If you don\u2019t have a history of it and you haven\u2019t had any concussions or signs of head trauma, I would tell them the game is safe. And it\u2019s getting safer every day. I don\u2019t tell players whether they should play or not, it\u2019s just up to them. If you were stuck on a deserted island with a QB who\u2019s currently in the league and you had to escape, who would it be, and why? [Laughing] Why would I be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback? Depends on how we\u2019re getting off the island. What\u2019s my escape route? We flying off? We on a boat? Give me Russell Wilson, man. I\u2019m a Russell fan. He\u2019s got all the attacks. He\u2019s mobile, he\u2019s able to deal, there\u2019s all sorts of situations he\u2019s able to get himself out of. He\u2019s a one-man showdown up there in Seattle. I like Russell. You came up with your famous touchdown celebration,\u00a0the Mile High salute,\u00a0as a sign of respect for servicemen and women. Is there any advice you\u2019d give players who are kneeling during the anthem in protest of racial inequality? No. Those players weren\u2019t kneeling because they don\u2019t like the military. I stand. I also understand people who don\u2019t want to stand for the anthem and why they\u2019re doing it: It\u2019s not about our military, it\u2019s not about them not liking America. They\u2019re just bringing attention to an issue in the communities that they come from. And I\u2019m all for that. This is a country where we\u2019re taught to fight for things we believe in and speak for people who don\u2019t have a voice. I\u2019ve spoken to a number of servicemen and women who have shared that they don\u2019t mind \u2015 that that\u2019s what they fought for, for us to have that platform and to have the right to do that. So long as it\u2019s a peaceful assembly in protest, they were all for that.\u00a0 I would say, too, that the first time people were protesting it brought awareness to that. Now, the second thing is, what\u2019s the plan after that? If you\u2019re still kneeling and there\u2019s no plan, then you\u2019re just kneeling to be kneeling. If there\u2019s not a plan behind it after the first couple of times, then that\u2019s probably not the best course of action.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have an issue with it, because I understood why the players were kneeling. Is it foolish to try to keep politics out of sports? I don\u2019t think you can. I understand the NFL doesn\u2019t want to deal with that. Former Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan had some rules with our locker room: Two things we don\u2019t talk about, religion and politics. And I understand, because those issues get heated. But it\u2019s woven into our culture now that when we do something, people [insert politics]. It\u2019s part of where we are now. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s foolish to try and keep it out, I think it\u2019s almost impossible to keep it out.\u00a0 Are you surprised Colin Kaepernick went unsigned? No. I\u2019m not surprised. In this league, they don\u2019t need everybody. They want you, but they don\u2019t need you. Obviously the issues that were happening with him, those owners weren\u2019t willing to take that risk. And then, not really knowing if he\u2019s going to be a good quarterback or not. He\u2019s better than some QBs in this league, but is it worth the risk for them? I\u2019m not shocked he wasn\u2019t signed. If you hadn\u2019t ended up in football, what do you think you would have ended up doing? Oh, my goodness. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t look at life like that. I know my first move, if I\u2019d been cut in training camp, would have been to go back to Georgia and parlay my relationships at Georgia with alumni and maybe work in Atlanta somewhere. Maybe that would\u2019ve been my first move, but other than that, I have no idea what my life would\u2019ve turned out to be. Are you concerned at all with the drop in NFL TV viewership? I\u2019m not. Maybe there\u2019s a few reasons why that happened. NFL viewership has gone up every year, and at some point it corrects. And it may have plateaued this year, may have even shrunk a little bit, but I think that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s such a big industry, and the fan base the NFL has is tremendous. Now \u2015 next year, if it happens again, I think the league be saying, \u201cOK, what\u2019s going on now?\u201d But I think it\u2019s going to go up again this year.\u00a0 What is the future of\u00a0Thursday\u00a0Night Football? It seems like it\u2019s hated by players and fans. Do you see it going away? I don\u2019t see it going away anytime soon. There\u2019s too much money the league is making\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0Night Football, and I know some of the players hate it, but...\u00a0There\u2019s not enough groundswell and enough people pushing back against\u00a0Thursday\u00a0Night Football for it to just go away. I don\u2019t see that happening.\u00a0'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Backers of the internet streaming levy say it\u2019s just another step in governments\u2019 attempts to adapt the tax code to the modern world. Consumers no longer get DVDs at the local Blockbuster Video store, where they paid sales tax. Now, they download movies and shows directly to their devices. Streamers should pay taxes too, the tax advocates argue. But opponents object to the way some jurisdictions are going about the tax. Officials in Pasadena and other cities that have adopted similar rules, such as Benicia and Indio, California, argue that regulatory rules adopted nearly a decade ago give them the right to extend taxes to streaming services. Foes, led by the streaming industry, say the issue needs to go before the voters, or at the very least, city councils or state legislatures, before taxpayers start handing over more cash. The move to impose taxes on internet streaming is another step in an effort by cities and states to tax services that are downloaded from far-flung companies that likely don\u2019t have an office or other facility in that state. The so-called \u201cAmazon tax\u201d that some states are seeking to apply to out-of-state internet sales is one example. Taxing \u201ccloud\u201d services with a business-use levy is another. The taxes are akin to taxing electricity that a utility generates out-of-state, but is consumed in-state, or like cellphone taxes on wireless service.\u00a0 Pennsylvania and the city of Chicago took the lead on what\u2019s known as the Netflix tax, but not without controversy. As part of Chicago\u2019s 2015 \u201ccloud tax,\u201d the city was ready to begin applying a 9 percent tax to digital entertainment. But news reports prompted an uproar and consumers have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the tax, which has been temporarily suspended. And in August, as part of Pennsylvania\u2019s effort to address a $1.3 billion budget gap, the state extended its 6 percent sales tax to cover digital downloads, including music, videos, e-books, mobile apps and games. At least 45 other cities were initially advised that they also could apply utility taxes like those charged for electricity and cable TV to video downloads, including San Bernardino, Glendale, Santa Monica, Culver City and Pico Rivera. The financial firm MuniServices, which helps cities with structuring and collecting utility taxes, worked with the cities on the tax. Their taxes range from 4.5 to 11 percent. Beyond that, streaming video services worry the utility tax extension or a form of entertainment or use tax could spread to other states and municipalities.\u00a0 Now, according to MuniServices attorney Donald Maynor, the cities are reassessing and talking to the video industry about their products and how to fairly apply the tax. \u201cThe whole idea was to treat everybody the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way, we can keep our rates down and nobody gets a free ride.\u201d Joe Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group, says governments are looking at emerging technologies and taking small bites of the tax apple, which stirs up opposition from affected industries or groups. \u201cAs new things emerge, very few proposals are structured as \u2018Let\u2019s tax all services,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey are structured as \u2018Let\u2019s tax this service.\u2019 That makes it a political thing.\u201d Despite the opposition, Henchman said, as the economy moves inexorably in the digital direction, the tax structure will follow. \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d Pasadena Problem In September, a memo from Pasadena\u2019s director of finance, Matthew Hawkesworth, attached to the city manager\u2019s newsletter said his office had determined that \u201call video programming\u201d should be treated the same, \u201cregardless of technology or service supplier.\u201d That meant they would all be subject to a utility users tax of about 9 percent approved by voters in 2008, before streaming video services became so prevalent. The 2008 referendum said the utility tax would apply to any transmission of \u201cvoice, data, audio, video or any other information.\u201d It passed by a 58 to 42 percent margin. In his memo, Hawkesworth specifically mentioned \u201cHulu, Netflix, Sling TV and Fullscreen Media.\u201d He said the tax would take effect Jan. 1. Earlier projections estimated it would raise about $10 million a year. News of the planned utility tax expansion drew quick complaints from Pasadena residents, and city officials said they would review the issue further. A spokesman called Hawkesworth\u2019s memo \u201cpremature.\u201d \u201cThe notion of extending the 2008 voter-approved [utility users tax] to additional cable-like services is under review,\u201d said city spokesman William Boyer. \u201cThere is no timeline for when the issue will be decided.\u201d Robert Callahan, the Internet Association\u2019s California executive director, objected to using a utility tax to put an assessment on streaming video. \u201cUtility taxes have been applied to water, sewer and cable TV. The idea that we are taxing Netflix and Hulu like water doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. Callahan did not dismiss the idea that a modern society might need to change the way taxes are assessed, but said changes in the utility tax are not the way to go. Further, Callahan said that streaming companies would like to participate in any municipal or state discussion over taxation, rather than having administrators simply extend an existing tax to their product with no debate. David Kline, spokesman for the California Taxpayers Association, an anti-tax group, brought up another problem endemic to taxing pixels rather than hardware: pixels are portable. What happens if you subscribe to Netflix in California, but watch \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d while on vacation in Hawaii. Which state gets the tax? \u201cIs the city going to tax all your use of the service when it\u2019s completely out of their jurisdiction?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost impossible to audit.\u201d Chicago Suit In 2015, Chicago announced it would extend the city\u2019s 9 percent amusement tax and personal property lease transaction tax, such as that paid on the lease of a car or other equipment, to cover Netflix, Spotify and other streaming services. Like Pasadena, the decision was made administratively, without council action or a vote. The city estimated the extended tax would bring in about $12 million annually to the cash-strapped city. The nonprofit Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian group that believes in \u201crestraints on government power,\u201d filed a class-action suit against the tax. \u201cIt looked to us like the city didn\u2019t have authority to do this, particularly without city council action,\u201d center attorney Jeffrey Schwab said. The litigation put the brakes on the tax, which was to have taken effect Sept. 1, 2015. The ruling was issued without comment in a routine list of administrative changes. It said that the city would now charge amusement tax on downloaded music like Spotify or \u201cfor the privilege of watching electronically delivered television shows, movies or videos \u2026 delivered to a patron in the city.\u201d A spokesman for the city\u2019s legal department, Bill McCaffrey, said that the city remains \u201cconfident that the amusement tax properly applies to streaming video, music and games, and we will continue to defend against the ongoing litigation.\u201d Recently, the city filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the court rejected it. Schwab said there\u2019s a difference between the city\u2019s amusement tax, which applies to shows and ball games, and the internet streaming tax. \u201cIf you buy a ticket to a Cubs game, you pay a 9 percent tax. But if you buy a ticket to a St. Louis Cardinals game, the city [of Chicago] doesn\u2019t impose a tax on you. However, if you are a Chicago resident and you watch a Netflix movie in St. Louis you are taxed.\u201d Imagine, Schwab said, if there was a \u201cNetflix of Poland.\u201d Would Chicago impose a tax on residents who wanted to watch films in Polish? \u201cThat seems like it goes way beyond the four corners of Chicago.\u201d  '}.

I am proposing a sane world -- I must be crazy.\"\n-- Swami Beyondananda Japan just made reality illegal. Well, maybe I exaggerate just a little.  Reality is still permitted to exist in Japan -- it's just illegal to talk about it. A new -- and thankfully very unpopular -- State Secrets Act makes whistleblowing (and reporting leaks from whistleblowers) illegal, and punishable by 10 years in prison! While this law was ostensibly passed to prevent \"state secrets\" being passed to \"enemies,\" it is far more likely that the current batch of state secrets are to cover up the mega-disaster at Fukushima, and the enemies are none other than the Japanese people, and people everywhere. So while TEPCO can continue leaking radioactive poison into the ocean, reporters cannot leak stories about it. Welcome to the world of institutionalized insanity, where Official Media selling Official Stories insist that we the people ignore our eyes, ears, and senses -- not to mention worldwide reports of raised levels of radiation in Alaska and California, and mysterious die-offs of starfish in the Pacific.  Fortunately, we have organizations like Project Censored to publish a more balanced account, and a respectable ecologist David Suzuki to offer a grim warning. Indeed, many of those who allow themselves to pay attention see the Fukushima meltdown as what may be the beginning of the end of human life on earth, and even more likely the collapse of civilization as we know it. While there are actually people who get some strange \"juice\" from tales of doom and gloom, I am not one of those. And ... I am also not willing to put my head in the sand and pretend that the insane is somehow sane. Here is my sober assessment of the situation: Humanity has just received some alarming lab results that indicate we are suffering from a life-threatening condition that will prove fatal unless we take immediate, collective action.   We can speculate if the world leaders are just dazed and confused, or whether there is a concerted effort to \"run out the clock\" and make sure that the population is appropriately controlled and drugged during the dying process. Either way, it is now up to the people of the world. Do we want to live, or do we want to quietly die? Again, I say none of this lightly. No one wants to face our children and grandchildren and say, \"Sorry about that.  Guess we left you with life-threatening challenges and an increasingly toxified world of scarcity. But no worries. You can still watch reality TV to avoid watching reality.\" Yes, crisis precipitates evolutionary opportunity. And ... the window of opportunity will only stay open so long. When the window is gone, well ... so long. Humanity's Existential Crisis Humanity is undergoing an existential crisis in a very real way. We are in the process of choosing if we want to exist or not. As more and more of us are coming to see, to navigate the evolutionary passage in front of us, we will have to recognize ourselves as cells in one related organism. Having spent the past 5,000 years focusing on survival of the fittest (we all know that Social Darwinism pre-dated Darwin by about 4,850 years), we must now shift to thrival of the fittingest. If we fit into the web of life, we survive and thrive. If we don't fit, we don't survive. And for those of you concerned about the financial costs of making these fundamental changes, I offer this dire warning: If humanity goes extinct, there goes the GDP! Reading about the starfish die-off, the elevated radiation levels on the west coast (where I live) and the increasing dangers of a very poorly managed \"clean up\" at Fukushima, I admit to having dark thoughts this past week. Someone asked the Swami if he believed in the Big Bang Theory and he said, \"Well, I used to. But now I am leaning more toward the Lone Nut Theory.\" How else could we explain the nuttiness we are experiencing now? So ... what would it be like for a critical mass of the uncritical masses to \"go sane\" and declare the physical world our \"sane asylum\"? First, we must face the dire prognosis with clarity, awareness, courage and resourcefulness.  To take a cue from a wise teacher, Jean Houston, maybe our entire species is undergoing a Hero's Journey.  We must now collectively (and individually, of course) face our demons, and work together to overcome steep odds. This means playing an entirely new game, and while the outcome of the new game is still undetermined, we do know that the old game will lead to death. In Spontaneous Evolution, Bruce Lipton and I talk about the phenomenon called \"spontaneous remission.\" A certain percentage of patients who receive a dire prognosis and are told to \"go home and get your affairs in order\" miraculously recover. While their recovery might seem like some anomalous act of grace, it turns out that those who recover have something in common. According to Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona, author of Coyote Medicine, spontaneous remission is often accompanied by what he calls \"a change of story\". When Bruce and I wrote this several years ago, we thought of \"spontaneous evolution\" as a noun in the future. I now see clearly it is a verb in the present. Our positive choice is to write and then live into a new story. The dire prognosis is calling forth evolutionary change, where we gather under \"one big intent\" to use our collective intelligence intelligently and our resources resourcefully. We have the technological wherewithal to mobilize the global village. Now we need the \"aware-with-all\" and the will, and the willingness. One of my colleagues and mentors, Donny Epstein, originator of Network Spinal Analysis says, \"Pain is an invitation to progress.\" Society's institutions and misleaders -- in seeking to protect what must collapse -- are doing everything they can to numb or manage the pain. As Donny says, to transform the pain, we must first feel it, acknowledge it, and accept it. What would it be like to have the conversation about the true state of the natural world in community, in our churches and spiritual centers, in our schools, and of course in our families?  What would it be like to break this conversation through the \"soundless barrier\" so the media has to report it? Donny makes another very powerful distinction that applies here and now. In his 30 years in the healing professions, he has found that patients who declare, \"I want to live\" are far more likely to survive and thrive than those who say, \"I don't want to die.\" Please be with that for a few moments. As a civilization that has lost its spiritual moorings and insists that only the material world is \"real\", there is a profound fear of death. Some sanity in this regard is emerging through the hospice and conscious dying movements. Still, heroic end-of-life interventions are still the costliest and most futile forms of medicine.   And ... along with change of story, one of the markers for overcoming life-threatening conditions is having a compelling future to live for. So what would it be like for Humanity to declare the future it chooses to live into? Seriously. What if there was a positive, proactive mission statement for Humanity, a vector pointing toward greater health, well-being, and sanity? Businesses write mission statements, as do individuals who are \"up to something.\" What if communities, nations and even our entire human community declared what they seek to bring to the world? Doesn't it make sense that every region, every state, every nation has something that it does or creates better than anyone else? What would it be like for a billion or two billion or three billion people to declare they are choosing a world where there is thrival for all? And then, what would it be like to actually create a structure and DO something to demonstrate this? Some 70 years ago, the United States gathered its greatest scientists and resources in a secret project, the Manhattan Project, to build the first weapons of mass-destruction, nuclear power. What if all of Humanity today called forth our current resources in a massive campaign to create renewable, nonpolluting energy so abundant that no armies are needed to defend it? We could call it the Man-Helping Project to create a web of mass-construction, new clear power. Imagine if this were done without the control of any government or single corporation, but simply by a new entity that declared the mission and gathered the resource.   This is an idea whose time has come. And ... it will only happen through our collective awareness, intention, and practical focus. So as we begin a new year, let's recognize that the evolutionary upwising is fully underway. Let's shoot way past apathy and despair, and let's call forth the healing and transformational energy in our community and world. Let's take the bad news coming from Japan and the Pacific Ocean as \"karma fuel\" to propel us toward what the Swami would call Humanifest Destiny ... manifesting our destiny as a healthy and whole species.   Proclaiming and then gathering around this \"sane center\" in the wake of this low point can be the turning point ... and set us on course to the tipping point.'}.

Thumper was homeless and abandoned in a yard. There were three litters stranded in the bushes left to die. Nine kittens were saved that day by PACT, including Thumper.\n\nPACT -- People and Cats Together is a nonprofit rescue organization that has been on a mission rescuing cats, spaying, neutering and finding homes for kittens. They have been rescuing animals for years, but Thumper was a unique case.  \n\nThumper could not keep up with his litter mates. He was falling behind. He couldn't walk or even stand. His back legs were not strong enough to support him. He would get around by crawling and dragging his body across the floor. He wanted so badly to play with the other kittens, but his legs prevented him from being able to.  \n\nPACT took him to the vet and Thumper was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder. He was born with the disease and there was no cure. It is simply that some cats recover and others do not.  The vet did not know if Thumper would ever walk. \n\nIf PACT had not rescued Thumper from the yard that day, there is no way Thumper would have survived. He would have been prey, or hit by a car, or even worse ... he would not even have been able to move to find food or shelter.  \n\nPACT rescuer Jane and Thumper's foster mom Anita brainstormed together to figure out ways to help Thumper rehabilitate, so he could live his life like a regular kitten. The odds of finding a home for a disabled cat would be significantly lower than a healthy one. PACT came up with an idea to have a special walker constructed to help strengthen Thumper's legs. Some people were skeptical that Thumper could recover this way, but once Thumper was given the little extra help he needed, he took his first steps.\n\nThumper was walking faster every day. His legs grew stronger. Soon he was running with the help of his walker. After two weeks of therapy, Thumper had proved all his doubters wrong. A cat has never been so determined to walk before. Soon, he didn't even need it and could stand on his own.  Now, nothing is stopping Thumper. He doesn't use the walker. Thumper plays with his litter mates like all the others. He tackles them, and chases after strings and feathers. He doesn't seem to get tired. He jumps up on laps and loves all the extra love and attention that he gets for being special. Thumper is an inspiration. He was resilient. He just wanted to be like every other cat, and he is! Now, Thumper runs like any other cat, but with a little extra swagger. It would be impossible to know that Thumper was unable walk when he was first rescued, but that's what makes him extraordinary.  Thumper is currently up for adoption and waiting to run, jump, play and be loved in a home somewhere special.

Cooperation. Humility. Honest, caring, open communication. Call it the softer side of oil and gas. Gone may be the image of the big, bad oil producers, muscling their way to dig up the resources below. They no longer want to be on the defensive. Simply, the us-versus-them idea has to go. \"The next 20 years will truly change the world,\" Jerre Stead, CEO of IHS, a global consulting firm, told a packed house at the Colorado Convention Center last week during the Colorado Oil and Gas Association's annual conference. \"Now, the opportunity comes along once in a lifetime, maybe, to make an impact on the world. ... One of the ways we can help each other most is to be very proactive. Stop being defensive. Together, if we're going to create truly long-term national energy policy, we need to be positive and consistent and speak as a single voice,\" Stead said. The theme seemed to override every discussion at the convention last week. Speakers included Peter Kareiva, the chief scientist from the Nature Conservancy, calling for the oil and gas and conservation industries to work together, as neither side will go away anytime soon; and Alex Trembath, policy analyst with The Breakthrough Institute, a California think tank, calling for a new eco-modernism that rethinks traditional environmentalist ideology and rejects the idea that man is ruining nature. As industry officials and employees sat and listened, more than a few raised their eyebrows at what they heard on the stage before them, as speakers ushered in the era of cooperation -- even harmony -- with conservationists, meeting fractivists in the middle, and finding common ground. \"The emphasis at the conference was to change the nature of the dialogue, away from an us-vs-them framework to one where we acknowledge that we are all in this together,\" COGA president and CEO Tisha Schuller said in an email response to questions. \"We all use energy and the products of energy. We all want to protect our family, our community and our Colorado natural environment. Polarization becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where we expect conflict and so further exacerbate the situation. Meeting in the middle is complex, time consuming, trying, and messy. But ultimately, it is the only way to get anything worthwhile accomplished.\" While the industry has grown in the last couple of years, and helped Colorado pull out of the Great Recession, residents have become increasingly skeptical as they organize through social networking, some organizing fracking bans in cities, or calling for moratoriums to study the health effects. Residents have expressed concern about the types of chemicals used in fracking fluids, formulas for which an increasingly competitive industry has been reticent to reveal, lest lose an advantage; residents worry about those chemicals seeping into ground water; they show videos of fugitive emissions pouring from tank batteries, polluting the air. They've called for action, and want sound, scientific proof the industry does not harm the environment or people as the industry encroaches more on urban neighborhoods and schools. While the industry has attempted to answer the myriad questions surrounding their activities that have been ongoing in Weld County for 40 years without dangerous health effects, they've faced increasing skepticism and stricter regulations. Most recently, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission placed tighter setback rules for locating drilling activities near buildings. The state Air Quality Control Commission is looking into stricter requirements on emissions from oil and gas facilities and operations. Stead, speaking about how the industry will be looked at in history, espoused the open and honest approach to dealing with detractors. His method to communication was three-pronged: treat absolutely everyone with dignity and respect; facts are friends; and create a strong educational base for the future. \"We have an opportunity to make a much bigger difference to look back 15 years from now and say we changed the world,\" Stead said. \"If we bring resources together in this room and spend a fair amount of time, treasure and talent creating an education system that helps people understand what we truly are doing, what the facts are, what an incredible difference we can make to the world. We have that opportunity.\" As an example, he said, officials need to tackle emissions head-on. \"Be proactive of measuring, controlling and reducing emissions,\" Stead said. \"That's an example of where we can deliver facts as friends. It will be a great example of activity making a difference on greenhouse gas emissions.\" If we don't solve some of the domestic issues, such as the residents' concerns, the country may lose out, he said. Natural gas prices in India are triple what they are in the United States, because of the increased natural gas production, which is expected to make America a net exporter by 2020. World energy consumption, he said, is expected to increase 52 percent from 2010 to 2040, 60 percent of which will come from Asia. Stead offered reaching for the opportunities will be difficult for an industry constantly on the defense. ___ (c)2013 the Greeley Tribune (Greeley, Colo.)

Most garden-variety disputes are self-advocated either outside the legal system or in court \u2015 the legal term is pro se, which is Latin for \u201cwinging it\u201d \u2015 and sometimes successfully. No one knows the exact number of pro se litigants in the United States, but a 2010 report by the American Bar Association found they were on the rise. \u201cNo book nor DIY method is an adequate substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney familiar with your particular circumstances,\u201d says Joy Butler, author of The Guide Through the Legal Jungle, a statement made without a hint of irony. Yes, there are plenty of resources for people who want to help themselves, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and your state Attorney General. But it\u2019s true, there\u2019s nothing like lawyering up. Reality check: I publish a list of executive contacts that can help you avoid darkening the door of a courtroom. And by way of full disclosure, I usually err on the side of doing everything myself. I\u2019ve only hired a lawyer twice in my life \u2015 once to defend against a frivolous and ultimately unsuccessful defamation suit, and another time to negotiate an employment contract. But when do you say \u201cenough\u201d and call a professional? When it\u2019s complicated Some consumer problems are simple; some aren\u2019t. When things turn complex, you may need to consult a pro, says Morris Lilienthal, a personal injury attorney. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the complexity of the legal issue,\u201d he says. Lilienthal recalls a recent case when a plaintiff gave a recorded statement to the other driver\u2019s insurance company, even though the other driver was the at-fault party. \u201cThe recorded statement he gave to the other insurance carrier was used as a basis to deny his claim,\u201d he remembers. If you\u2019re unsure of yourself, you can make mistakes. A lawyer can help. When you need an expert If your consumer dispute requires someone with a deep knowledge of a subject, you may need to lawyer up. \u201cYou should consider an attorney when expertise is necessary \u2015 for example, certain areas of tax, business law, or intellectual property,\u201d says Evan Walker, a lawyer based in La Jolla, Calif. You can quickly find yourself in deep water in a consumer dispute, and you\u2019ll benefit from the steady hand of someone who knows their stuff. When you\u2019re being threatened If someone is threatening to take you to court, you should talk to an attorney. \u201cA consumer who\u2019s been merely threatened with a lawsuit should at least talk to a lawyer, if not hire one,\u201d says Daniel Watts, an attorney based in Carlsbad, Calif. For example, say you write a negative review of a sandwich shop on Yelp, and the business owner threatens to sue for defamation, consider at least asking a lawyer to review the complaint. \u201cThis takes just a few minutes of a lawyer\u2019s time,\u201d adds Watts, \u201cbut it\u2019s worth it.\u201d When you\u2019re being sued If someone has filed a lawsuit against you, then you need to fight fire with fire. \u201cConsumers should absolutely consult an attorney if they are sued,\u201d says Sara J. O\u2019Connell, a San Diego-based lawyer. And with good reason: In court, you could lose some of your rights if you don\u2019t follow certain rules or meet certain deadlines. So you\u2019ll want someone who knows the ins and outs of the system. When there\u2019s a tricky contract involved \u201cIt\u2019s true, we live in a DIY world,\u201d says J.R. Skrabanek, senior counsel with the Snell Law Firm in Austin, Texas. \u201cBut there is no substitute for an attorney when a consumer\u2019s complaint arises out of a contract, especially one containing a mandatory arbitration clause, a forum selection clause, or a choice of law clause.\u201d These provisions are typically, though not always, enforceable, yet they massively influence a consumer\u2019s options and pathways for actually achieving relief. \u201cEngaging in a fight without an attorney in such a situation is fraught with peril,\u201d says Skrabanek. When you\u2019re confused And that happens more often than you think. You read a contract one way; a company interprets it differently. \u201cEveryone can read a document and understand what the literal meaning is,\u201d says Allie Petrova, the managing partner of a tax and business boutique law firm based in Greensboro, N.C. \u201cA contract may tell you that New York law applies, but will not show on its face how a savvy attorney or a judge would interpret the contract under New York case law and statutory law.\u201d People often miss nuances and details that could work in their favor. A lawyer can help with that. Now that you\u2019ve decided you need a lawyer, there\u2019s just one small detail: the cost. Lawyers are expensive. The average hourly rate for the typical consumer law attorney is $361, according to the National Consumer Law Center. That\u2019s a lot of money. You can either pay up or consider a legal service plan like LegalShield, which could keep your costs down. In a perfect world, lawyers would be affordable to everyone. But then, if they were, there\u2019d probably fewer consumer advocates \u2015 and you wouldn\u2019t be reading this right now. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='What Did AT&T And Novartis Get For The Money They Paid Trump's Lawyer?', body='WASHINGTON \u2015 The world\u2019s largest telecommunications company, an investment firm tied to a Russian oligarch, a pharmaceutical conglomerate and an aircraft manufacturer competing for a government contract all sent money to President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer through the same shell company he used to pay off a porn star who says she had sex with the reality television star turned commander-in-chief. That raises a few questions. But even the most innocent explanation for the transactions \u2014 that companies were paying Trump lawyer Michael Cohen in an attempt to buy access to or influence the president \u2014 represents a form of corruption. Here\u2019s what we know: AT&T paid Cohen\u2019s limited liability company, Essential Consultants LLC, roughly $600,000, according to documents, but claimed that Cohen did no legal or lobbying work for the telecom firm. The company, which was seeking government approval of a merger with Time Warner Inc., said\u00a0the payments were for \u201cinsights\u201d into the administration. Columbus Nova, a New York investment firm with close ties to billionaire Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, paid Cohen\u2019s LLC around $500,000 \u2014 which was a \u201cconsulting fee\u201d that had nothing to do with Vekselberg,\u00a0Columbus Nova\u2019s lawyer\u00a0told The New York Times. Novartis, a pharmaceutical giant, acknowledged paying Essential Consultants LLC $100,000 per month for one year ($1.2 million total) and said that \u201cany agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.\u201d They said\u00a0the payments were for \u201chealthcare policy matters.\u201d A seven-page document\u00a0prepared by Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress, said that Cohen\u2019s company also received money from Korea Aerospace Industries. The company told Bloomberg it paid Cohen one $150,000 payment for advice on what the outlet refers to as\u00a0local accounting standards. A spokesman maintained that their contract with Cohen was legal. We also know that the special counsel team headed up by Robert Mueller has known about all of this for awhile. Novartis told The Wall Street Journal that Mueller\u2019s office contacted the company about six months ago, in November 2017. Cohen\u2019s attorney Stephen Ryan did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s inquiry about the payments, but told The Atlantic\u00a0only that the money Essential Consultants LLC received from Columbus Nova was \u201cnot a payment.\u201d But Tuesday night\u2019s revelations still leave us with more questions than answers. Here are a few of the big ones: Several of these companies had business before the government or a vested interest in legislation the government was considering. But how did they come to pay the same shell company that Cohen used to pay Stormy Daniels? What were they expecting in exchange for their money? Cohen \u2015 the graduate of what\u2019s often called the worst law school in America \u2015 had a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d with the law firm Squire Patton Boggs for about a year, which ended shortly after the FBI raided several locations used by Cohen, including his Squire Patton Boggs office at 30 Rock.  Korea Aerospace Industries has been working with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin to bid for a multi-billion dollar contract with the U.S. Air Force. That contract is expected to be awarded this year, according to The Times. AT&T paid Cohen four installments of $50,000 from early 2017 to January 2018. The telecommunications giant currently has a proposed merger with Time Warner pending before the Justice Department but has denied that Cohen did any \u201clegal or lobbying work\u201d for the company. Some have also noted that AT&T\u2019s payments ended shortly after Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,\u00a0voted to repeal net neutrality.  It\u2019s unclear precisely what services Cohen \u2015 not a man necessarily known for his expertise on health care policy \u2015 provided to the pharmaceutical company Novartis. Novartis and AT&T didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cHow the fuck did Avenatti find out?\u201d\u00a0a source who confirmed the payments did in fact happen\u00a0asked The Daily Beast Tuesday. Avenatti said on MSNBC Tuesday night that he knew \u201cfor a fact\u201d there were three Suspicious Activity Reports filed with the Treasury Department by a bank that handled money paid to Cohen\u2019s LLC. Banks are required to file such reports, also known as SARs, when they know or suspect that transactions \u201cinvolve money laundering or violate the Bank Secrecy Act.\u201d Avenatti said the Treasury Department should release those reports and claimed that officials had rejected his prior requests to do so. Some have speculated Avenatti has already gotten access to those reports and that they were the basis of the document released Tuesday. He pushed that point on Twitter later Tuesday evening, saying there was \u201dno reason why the SARs should not be released.\u201d \u201cDemand it!\u201d he concluded. So far, the White House hasn\u2019t commented and referred questions to Trump\u2019s outside lawyers. Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani said he didn\u2019t know anything about\u00a0Essential Consulting\u2019s work. And Cohen has likewise remained mum. But Cohen has long been Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a trusted fixer. As recently as last month, Trump maintained that Cohen was\u00a0still his lawyer, even though he has moved to\u00a0distance himself from the man in recent weeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One in response to a question about a hush money payment to Daniels. \u201cMichael is my attorney. You\u2019ll have to ask Michael.\u201d At least $4.4 million flowed through Cohen\u2019s LLC between just before Trump\u2019s election through January, the New York Times\u00a0reported. A Washington Post breakdown said there is more money somewhere, but details are incomplete. Avenatti speculated that the answer to this question is the bigger issue. \u201cIt\u2019s where did the money go,\u201d he said on MSNBC before challenging Cohen to release his bank statements affiliated with the LLC. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to hide here and it\u2019s all above board and it\u2019s all legal, then the documents will prove that out. People lie, documents don\u2019t. Period.\u201d S.V. Date and Amanda Terkel contributed reporting.\u00a0This article has been updated with more recently reported figures for the amount paid to Cohen by AT&T.

Investigators hired by the county were looking into the\u00a0May 1 crash of a public website that was displaying returns on election night. In a report released Friday, Sword & Shield Enterprise Security said no election data was compromised in the apparent denial-of-service attack, but that they did discover an attempt to \u201cexploit the backend database behind the Web server.\u201d Officials said the server was only storing data meant for public display, was not connected to any system where the raw votes were being tallied, and no vote tallies were compromised. \u201cIt\u2019s not connected to any live databases,\u201d\u00a0David Ball, the Knox County deputy director of IT, told HuffPost. \u201cNone of it is primary information that\u2019s kept on that server. It\u2019s a repository for being able to report to the public, and we have intentionally kept any primary data extremely isolated.\u201d Investigators traced two of the IP addresses involved in the attack to Ukraine and the U.K., according to the report. They also said IP addresses from an unusually high number of foreign countries \u2015 approximately 65 \u2015\u00a0targeted the website on election night. The most requests came from Canada, the U.K., Chile, France and Italy. Addresses associated with Russia did attempt to contact the network, according to the report, but not as many times as those associated with other countries did. Sword & Shield analyzed web traffic on election night and saw symptoms typical of a denial-of-service attack, a type of cyberattack meant to crash or slow down a website.\u00a0During the same time period, they said, they saw an attempt to breach the public-facing election results website. Investigators re-enacted the attempted breach and discovered a vulnerability in the database behind the public website.\u00a0They were not sure what exactly caused the crash on election night, but did say the website crashed when they were testing the vulnerability themselves. \u201cThere is not a clear indication whether the Web site crash was due to the\u00a0traffic of the [investigators\u2019] scan, the vulnerability being accessed, a combination of both or another external factor,\u201d the report said, adding that further testing would determine the cause. Ball declined to discuss the specifics of the vulnerability, citing security practices, but said officials promptly removed it once they learned of it.\u00a0The attempted breach was similar to the attacks that several states experienced\u00a0during the 2016 presidential election, he said.\u00a0The disclosure comes as states are working to improve their election security after attempted Russian hacking during that election. \u201cIn this case, it was just a matter of, there was a way to get in, to look around, but that was pretty much the extent of it,\u201d Ball said. It\u2019s not clear what the hackers were interested in,\u00a0the IT official said, but there was a range of possibilities. \u201cIt might have been one of those things, had the election data been actually living on that server, there might have been an attempt to alter that. Or there might have been an attempt to redirect traffic from the real website to a phony website somewhere else,\u201d\u00a0Ball said.  After discovering the exploit, investigators reviewed the county\u2019s system for storing election results. They noted that election data is physically transported from polling places to an isolated central repository. Officials use memory cards to physically transfer the data from that central repository to separate computers to upload onto the web.  \u201cThis process provides data integrity. No data is carried back to the isolated master system that contains the official election results,\u201d the report said. \u201cDue to the lack of network connectivity and the fact that all data that goes into the isolated master system can be validated back to each polling station and to each polling machine, no compromise of official election data could have been carried out.\u201d Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley who is an expert on election auditing, reviewed the Sword & Shield report and said questions still remained. \u201cThe assurance that no data could possibly flow from outside the tally system into the tally system is basically, \u2018This is what Knox County told us,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.\u00a0Also missing from the report, he said, was any indication of whether the country reused memory cards and, if so, how often it wiped them,\u00a0as well as confirmation that the voting machines had no wireless functionality. Ball said the county\u2019s election systems don\u2019t have any network functionality at all. The memory cards that carry the results from a central tabulator to a networked workstation are reused, he said, but \u201conly after a low-level format and security scan.\u201d \u201cThe webserver cannot send any data to the workstations,\u201d\u00a0Ball said.\u00a0'}.

You need something you know, and something you have to properly protect your most valuable data: Your money. We recently discovered a cybersecurity incident involving consumer information. Once discovered, we acted immediately to stop the intrusion. Today\u2019s Equifax hack (referenced in the above Tweet) supposedly exposed credit histories of up to 143 million Americans (with a 50 percent chance that you are going to be affected). According to the New York Times, if you have a credit report, you may be affected. Well, that covers all the adults I know. I would say one of the most important things you could do in the next 15 minutes is to add two-factor authentication to all your banking and brokerage accounts.  Your actual passwords are encrypted, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s dangerous here. It\u2019s your social security numbers, drivers license numbers, and previous addresses that can be used to RESET your password that makes this an urgent issue. It\u2019s the best way we, as consumers and users of the credit system, can protect ourselves from these kinds of security breaches. Here\u2019s what to do to increase your protection from today\u2019s (and future) online account identity theft and fraud, in three quick steps:  1. Call your brokerage firm: and ask them to \u201cEnable 2 Factor Authentication\u201d for all your accounts. Make sure to ask if there are other ways to access your account that doesn\u2019t need the two-factor method, such as automated phone systems, and consider disabling access to your accounts there unless they upgrade those systems to offer two factor as well. 2. Download:  a two-factor app that your firm will name. Typical examples of these apps are Symantec VIP, or Authy. After you launch and install the app, they will ask you for a token code displayed on the screen. (If your bank or brokerage doesn\u2019t offer this service, consider moving to a firm that does, like Fidelity Investments, or Charles Schwab. It\u2019s not worth brand loyalty to not have proper security. At least tell them that you are leaving unless they do. If enough customers do that, they will add it.) 3. Log In: you will be required to open the mobile app and enter a dynamic code that appears. If you dont have a smartphone, or, you just want access to this code without needing your phone, you can usually order a credit card sized token card that will do the same thing as the app. This is what I do, as I like having this in my wallet in case my phone is dead, or left at home. For example, Symantec VIP offers one for $35 on Amazon. Don\u2019t worry, if you misplace your phone or your card, you will re-authenticate and repeat the process above through an extensive list of personal questions that hopefully would outreach the data that has been reported stolen. Good luck, and here\u2019s to securing that hard earned savings or retirement account from those who would wish to wire it out of your account without your blessing. #GetTwoFactor Disclaimer: Let it be known, I am not a financial advisor and am necessarily not authorized to recommend how you should manage your financial accounts, or their general security.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Report: College Hoops Corruption Case Poised To Wreak Havoc On Top Programs', body='NEW YORK \u2013 It has been five months since\u00a0the FBI arrested 10 men in a sweeping federal probe\u00a0into the underbelly of the basketball world. As the three ongoing criminal cases resulting from the investigation plod along, it\u2019s increasingly unlikely there will be another wave of double-digit arrests. More legal charges still could come, but what\u2019s becoming increasingly clear as the discovery portion of the case comes to a close is that the breadth of potential NCAA rules violations uncovered is wide enough to fundamentally and indelibly alter the sport of college basketball. The soundtrack to the three federal basketball corruption cases is essentially a ticking time bomb, which will inevitably explode. It will impact every major conference, Hall of Fame coaches, a score of current top players and some of the nation\u2019s most distinguished and respected programs. Multiple sources who\u2019ve been briefed on the case and are familiar with the material obtained by feds told Yahoo Sports that the impact on the sport will be substantial and relentless. Sitting under protective order right now are the fruits of 330 days of monitoring activity by the feds, which one assistant US Attorney noted Thursday was \u201ca voluminous amount of material.\u201d That includes wiretaps from 4,000 intercepted calls and thousands of documents and bank records obtained from raids and confiscated computers, including those from notorious NBA agent Andy Miller. \u201cThis goes a lot deeper in college basketball than four corrupt assistant coaches,\u201d said a source who has been briefed on the details of the case. \u201cWhen this all comes out, Hall of Fame coaches should be scared, lottery picks won\u2019t be eligible to play and almost half of the 16 teams the NCAA showed on its initial NCAA tournament show this weekend should worry about their appearance being vacated.\u201d There\u2019s a general expectation that this information will be released. It could come in trial, pre-trial motions or released by the government at some point. (No one is certain if they\u2019ve agreed to eventually give it to the NCAA if it doesn\u2019t go public.) So how bad could be it? In terms of NCAA rules, multiple sources told Yahoo Sports that the material obtained threatens the fundamental structure and integrity of the sport, as there\u2019s potentially as many 50 college basketball programs that could end up compromised in some way. Among the documents expected to be in the federal government\u2019s protection are the bank records of Miller, who bankrolled middle man, Christian Dawkins, who is at the center of two of the cases. \u201cIf the NCAA is going to get Andy Miller\u2019s bank records, God bless them, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d said another source with direct knowledge of the situation, chuckling at the thought. \u201cYou are better off changing the rules. The crazy part of this business is none of the kids are free.\u201d NCAA officials are staring at the prospect of a tournament with a winner that will likely be vacating its title\u00a0\u2013 and many others eventually vacating their appearances. There\u2019s a lingering mushroom cloud over the sport\u2019s upcoming showcase event that won\u2019t go away. The most fascinating and tricky variable here is time. There\u2019s a protective order on the evidence found in discovery in all three cases. Whether the information gets out in dribs and drabs or released at once, the consequences are expected to be severe. The government is not compelled to release the information, according to Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York who now teaches at Columbia Law School. \u201cSometimes never,\u201d he said when asked generally about the timing of the release of information under protective order. He added: \u201cThe main sources of release will be in the course of pretrial motions and trial, and/or as related investigations go overt.\u201d\u00a0 What\u2019s certain is that there\u2019s enough compromising information to rock the sport to its core. There will be thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of hours of wiretaps with the voices of prominent coaches brokering deals with the middlemen, sneaker executives and talent traffickers. Will it trickle out? Or get released all at once? That\u2019s complicated and procedural. The NCAA\u2019s involvement in this case so far has been minimal. They\u2019ve been in consistent contact with the federal investigators, careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. Whenever the information is released from under protective order, the NCAA will have to continue to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations as they begin their own. Miller\u2019s financial activity is expected to compromise dozens of programs and players, but he certainly wasn\u2019t a rogue agent. Rather, Miller was jockeying for clients in a competitive field where agents consistently exhibited similar behavior. (Miller did not return a call seeking comment.) The routine nature of agents, runners and financial advisors operating in a world rife with payoffs, bag drops and kickbacks leaves the federal investigators at a fascinating crossroads.\u00a0\u201cThe biggest mystery in this case is why more high-profile coaches and agents haven\u2019t been brought in,\u201d said the source who has been briefed on the case. As witnesses paint a picture of the depths of corruption in the basketball underworld, the feds need to make a decision whether they want to expose other sneaker companies, agents and coaches. So far, there\u2019s been no indication that they\u2019re prepared to do that. The basketball underworld is sophisticated and nuanced, a black market forged over decades of moving players.\u00a0Even with all the wiretaps and documents, the feds are still catching up on how it all worked. \u201cThe craziest part of it all is that they could have walked into one of 15 agent\u2019s offices and it\u2019s just as bad,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the situation. \u201cIt just would have been other people and other schools.\u201d There had been a flurry of activity in the case in the past week that had conjured some optimism for the defense attorneys. A Wall Street Journal report about\u00a0an undercover FBI agent under investigation\u00a0and\u00a0a motion filed revealing a paperwork error\u00a0appeared to poke some holes in the case. Those matters will ultimately have to be addressed, but any momentum for the defense attorneys was abruptly and tersely halted Thursday morning. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, presiding on the 26th floor of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan, denied a motion to dismiss one of the cases with the legal equivalent of a Dikembe Mutombo finger wag after a blocked shot. Lawyers for three of the defendants \u2013 Adidas executives Merl Code and Jim Gatto and business manager Christian Dawkins \u2013 had filed for a motion to dismiss the cases based essentially on the notion that the universities in the cases couldn\u2019t be considered victims.\u00a0They were, after all, benefitting from the players and their performances on the court. As Kaplan listened impatiently to Gatto\u2019s lawyer, Michael S. Schachter, argue the motion, the judge\u2019s mood vacillated between annoyed and ornery. His reactions to Schachter\u2019s arguments included, \u201cit would be quite a stretch,\u201d \u201care you kidding me?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve actually read the indictment.\u201d He made one jab about the media attention the case has generated and ultimately dismissed the motion by saying that Schachter\u2019s arguments would be better heard by a jury. (Schachter declined comment.) The trial for that case will begin on Oct. 1, and the case involving former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and clothier Rashan Michel starts on Feb. 4 of 2019. (Another judge set the date for the third case \u2013 which includes the other three assistant coaches \u2013 for April 22.) Until then, the NCAA tournament will be played amid the soundtrack \u2013 TICK, TICK, TICK \u2013 of potential chaos. Maybe the next one will, too. University presidents should be losing sleep. Millionaire coaches should be losing hair and plotting escapes to the NBA. And players should be preparing for their dirty laundry \u2013 or that of their relatives \u2013 to be aired. What would happen if the information under protective order were to be released before the NCAA selection show on March 11? A source who has been briefed on the case laughed: \u201cYou might see Tennessee-Chattanooga as a No. 2 seed.\u201d Read more from Yahoo Sports: A world away, U.S. tragedy brings tears to Olympics Isaiah Thomas: Rondo scuffle was about Celtics beef Radio host fired for ugly comment about underage Olympian This story was originally published on Yahoo News.'}.

It might be all wrong', body='Playing 'Spore' is a good way to explore evolution. 'Spore' screenshot By Alex Leith, Michigan State University You look down from the sky, manipulating the world and seeing how it responds to your changes. You are able to alter vegetation and climate while watching their effects on the surrounding organisms. In this way, and many others, digital games provide excellent opportunities for players to learn about complicated subjects, including the concept of evolution through natural selection. Even games designed for fun and not specifically for education can provide rich, concise, dynamic representations of complex science, technology, engineering and math topics. Since I was young, digital games have successfully supplemented the educational process in a range of topics, including math, science and biology. Research shows that if these games are going to actually teach those concepts, they must represent them accurately. Games that include incorrect depictions teach the wrong lessons. Since Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, evolution has been understood as a process based on genetic differences between individual organisms of the same species. There are three key principles: Some colleagues and I looked into how well current games could serve as educational tools, specifically about evolution. We examined how Darwinian evolution was represented in 22 games, which we located either through game databases like GameSpot or IGN, or through Google searches. Most games got evolution at least partly wrong. Only five accurately represented all three key principles of evolution.  \n\n\nA screen-capture of a Norn interacting with its environment in 'Creatures 2,' developed by Creatures Labs and published by Mindscape.\nWikipedia\n\n \"Creatures\" provides a rare example of the three principles. In that game, players create cartoon-like creatures called \"norns,\" through a process that allows norns to be altered not just in terms of appearance, but at the genetic level. For the most accurate representation of evolution, the game offers a play mode called \"wolfling run.\" In that mode, players cannot directly affect their norns, but can observe their relative fitness for a particular in-game scenario. The potential variations in both norn creation and the environment they must survive in provide for an astonishing number of evolutionary possibilities. Maxis, best known for creating the \"SimCity\" game series, and its spinoff \"The Sims\" collection, also made a set of games called \"SimEarth\" and \"SimLife.\" Like \"SimCity,\" both give players top-down control of a world. \"SimEarth\" was designed for players to make major changes to the weather, landscape and animals to create an environment. Players were then able to see how the animals would fare in this created environment. \"SimLife\" was more specific: it has players engage with the animals (rather than merely creating them) to learn about the biology surrounding their survival. \n\n\nA screen-capture of 'Who Wants to Live a Million Years,' playable on the Science Channel website.\nfrom sciencechannel.com\n\n We also found two academically oriented games that loosely presented the three mechanics of evolution: \"Selection Game\" and \"Who Wants to Live a Million Years\" (which was later renamed \"Charles Darwin's Game of Survival\"). The two games were designed to be simple tools that could be played quickly in places like museums. Despite the limited mechanics present in such games, they still clearly show each element of the evolution process.  The most commercially popular game we found didn't quite get evolution right. \"Spore\" left out something many other games did, too: Organisms' genetic differences didn't affect their survival rates. Instead, organisms whose genes were unfit for the environment would not necessarily die more often, in keeping with evolutionary principles. Rather, players could intervene and increase an organism's likelihood for success by, say, helping it move more intelligently and strategically, beyond the scope of its genetically predisposed movements. Nevertheless, \"Spore\" does a reasonable job presenting the broader concept of evolution to players, and is the best such game made this century. (\"Creatures,\" \"SimEarth,\" and \"SimLife\" are all from the 1990s.) \"Spore\" is also still available for purchase, so it is the only game readily usable by the average educator or student. But other findings were disappointing. Most games inaccurately portrayed evolution, usually in the same way Spore did - allowing player intervention to save organisms that were unfit for survival. For these other games, evolution becomes more akin to mutation during a single organism's life than a process that occurs through generations. In \"E.V.O.: Search for Eden\" and \"L.O.L.: Lack of Love,\" players earn points they can spend to modify their organisms. In \"Eco,\" at the end of each level, the player arbitrarily changes an attribute, though not necessarily one that affects an organism's survival prospects. In each of these cases, what the game calls \"evolution\" is actually external genetic manipulation, rather than inheriting particular traits. These inaccuracies may confuse those unsure of what evolution actually is. If other scientific subjects are similarly poorly depicted in video games, the potential educational benefits of these games could be lost. However, as game designers become more adept at modeling scientific themes, it could herald an educational revolution.

Now Blankenship Wants His Vote.', body='SHREWSBURY, W.Va. \u2015 Don Blankenship had been out of prison for only seven months when Tommy Davis started seeing his face and hearing his voice everywhere. Blankenship launched his bid to become West Virginia\u2019s next Republican senator late last year and started buying advertisements on local TV stations. They all began with a line that nauseated Davis: \u201cI\u2019m Don Blankenship, candidate for U.S. Senate, and I approve this message.\u201d  Davis stopped watching the local news to avoid the ads, retreating to the reliably Blankenship-free zones of hunting shows and Netflix. But then Blankenship\u2019s voice was there in Davis\u2019 pickup truck, via Pandora radio advertising. Davis had to limit his use of that, too, lest driving around town become its own form of torment.  \u201cIt seems no matter where I go or what I do, it\u2019s Don Blankenship,\u201d Davis, 50, said recently, driving along the Kanawha River in his Toyota Tacoma. Blankenship is the former Massey Energy chief executive who presided over the Upper Big Branch mining disaster, in Montcoal, West Virginia, in 2010. Davis was a miner at Upper Big Branch with his eldest son, Cory Davis; his only brother, Timmy Davis; and a nephew, Joshua Napper. Davis was making his way out of the mine during a shift change when the explosion happened. He bolted to the exit, wind and rocks tumbling around him, and made it out alive.  Twenty-nine men did not, including his three loved ones. The bodies of his son, brother and nephew were recovered together days after the blast, once it was safe to do so. Cory was the youngest of the dead at 20 years old. Various investigations faulted Massey officials for systematically cutting corners on safety and putting profits before their workers\u2019 lives. They found that Massey, under Blankenship\u2019s helm, had fostered a culture of fear and intimidation inside the mine and hidden safety lapses from regulators. Blankenship served one year in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. He has continued to deny responsibility for the worst mining catastrophe in four decades.\u00a0 The particular void left by Cory Boy, as Davis still refers to his son \u2015 \u201cmy hunting partner, my fishing partner, my all-around go-to buddy\u201d \u2015 has made the Blankenship redemption tour an unbearable spectacle for Davis, just as it has for other Upper Big Branch families. \u201cI actually thought he would stay the hell out of West Virginia,\u201d Davis said of Blankenship. \u201cHe just won\u2019t leave it alone.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s trying to put it back in our face. I call it harassment,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is: It\u2019s straight-up harassment.\u201d Blankenship has spent $2 million of his own money\u00a0on the campaign and has savaged his main Republican primary opponents, Congressman Evan Jenkins and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, in hopes of facing off in a general election against incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin (D), whom he personally blames for his prison sentence. Blankenship\u2019s campaign did not respond to several interview requests for this story. Although Blankenship has slipped\u00a0behind Jenkins and Morrisey in recent polls, buried in attack ads the GOP establishment is funding to keep him off the ticket, his candidacy is not a joke. For all his infamy, plenty of voters still associate him with good-paying blue-collar jobs in hollows without a whole lot of them. As Davis put it, \u201cThere are still people around here who worship the ground he walks on.\u201d The prospect of Sen. Don Blankenship, however unlikely, has polluted even the most solemn customs for Davis.  On April 5, he and other Upper Big Branch families made the drive up to the mine to observe the eighth anniversary of the disaster. Davis carries out the same ritual each year. He picks up 29 balloons \u2015 26 black and three orange, the latter signifying his family members \u2015 then heads to Cory\u2019s grave with his ex-wife, Cindy; their two sons, Seth and Nathan; and their grandson, Cory Tripp. There they release the balloons and talk. Then it\u2019s on to the mine site, where each of the dead has a cross. Davis hangs a wreath for all the miners and lays out three white roses for his family members.\u00a0He ties a white bandana to Cory\u2019s cross. He looks up to the spot on the mountain where he and the other miners would punch out at the end of their shifts. Then they drive down Coal River Road to the 48-foot granite memorial that was erected in 2012, showing 29 miners\u2019 silhouettes.  It was at the memorial where things got unpleasant at this year\u2019s anniversary gathering. Among the families, politicians and news crews was Gwen Thomas, the sister of Grover Skeens, one of the miners who was killed. Thomas has taken an unusual position among Upper Big Branch family members: She has called the disaster an act of God and praised Blankenship, who in turn has featured Thomas in a television ad and on the campaign trail.  The presence of an outspoken Blankenship supporter at the memorial was too much for Davis and other mourners. She defended the former CEO;\u00a0they gave her a piece of their minds.\u00a0A state trooper intervened. Davis has tried to curb his Facebook time during the Senate race. The night before the anniversary, he visited Blankenship\u2019s campaign page, where the candidate posts videos and says he\u2019ll bring jobs back to West Virginia. Davis uploaded a photo of Cory\u2019s gravesite onto Blankenship\u2019s page. \u201cHere look at my Cory boy 20 years young,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cTell him why you chose production over safety.\u201d  The next time Davis visited the page, his post was gone. \u00a0 *** On a recent Friday morning, Davis steered his ATV up a gravel road to a former strip-mining site, the back of his vehicle loaded with turkey decoys, spare camo clothes and a 12-gauge shotgun. What had once been a mountaintop now felt more like prairie, with long, flat stretches of grass and brush lying between hills. Davis used to work on sites like this one as a surface miner as they were stripped. Now he comes here to run his dogs, call for turkeys, or climb a treestand and wait for a buck. The time in the woods is bittersweet. It was his brother, Timmy, who taught him how to hunt, and Davis passed everything he knew on to Cory, who shot his first whitetail when he was 9. Now he mostly hunts alone, but he appreciates the quiet of the woods more than ever. Besides, any time spent in a treestand is time spent not drinking.  \u201cIf I sit at home and dwell on things,\u201d he said with a turkey call in his mouth, \u201cit\u2019ll just fuck me up.\u201d A few months after the disaster, Davis went back to work at a mine run by Alpha Natural Resources, the coal giant that would go on to acquire Massey. He still had a ringing in his ears from the blast and what would turn out to be post-traumatic stress disorder. He struggled with loud sounds. He had panic attacks. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think. I couldn\u2019t function. I was getting lost. I was having problems.\u201d He accepted a settlement for his son\u2019s death and stopped working.\u00a0Some families used their money to leave the state and start new lives. Davis stayed in West Virginia but as a slightly different person. He covered his body in tattoos, including 29 crosses along his back and the words \u201cCory Boy\u201d across his shoulders. He customized a Harley as a rolling memorial to Upper Big Branch.  A couple of years ago, he sold the house where Cory grew up because the memories were too painful. He bought a small ranch house at the end of a street of trailers that backs up on the Kanawha, far enough from the highway that all he hears at night is the river. He started an annual scholarship at Cory\u2019s high school in his name. The unofficial mission is to give kids better options than hoping for a coal resurgence. The lack of good-paying work is why people cling to someone like Blankenship, Davis said.  \u201cJust look around you. There ain\u2019t a hellacious lot to do here if you didn\u2019t go to college,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys who support [Blankenship] \u2015 they don\u2019t have other options as far as jobs go.\u201d Moving on has not been easy. He ends up at Cory\u2019s grave every other night or so, drinking a beer and turning one upside down for his son. Cory\u2019s friends are at the stage where they\u2019ve started families, and Davis finds himself wondering if Cory would have had a son, too: \u201cWould he have been tall or short, fat or skinny, would he have looked more like him or more like her, and other questions we\u2019ll never know the answer to.\u201d  Blankenship\u2019s visibility and lack of contrition have made it all the harder. He has maintained, contrary to official investigations, that the root cause of the blast at Upper Big Branch was a sudden influx of natural gas in the mine, rather than an excessive amount of coal dust, which is highly explosive. The distinction is crucial. Coal operators have an obligation to keep coal dust levels in check, through sufficient ventilation and rock-dusting, a process that neutralizes coal dust with pulverized limestone.  What happened at Upper Big Branch was investigated by\u00a0federal regulators,\u00a0state regulators, the United Mine Workers of America union, and an independent panel established by Manchin, who was West Virginia\u2019s governor at the time. To varying degrees, they all faulted Massey for poor ventilation and inadequate rock-dusting practices in the mine.  The explosion likely started when the shearer on a mining machine ignited a methane fireball, thanks in part to poorly maintained equipment. But it would have been the high levels of coal dust that sent it ripping through more than 2 miles of the mine shaft, so that even men far from the blast couldn\u2019t escape. (The UMWA went so far as to title its report \u201cIndustrial Homicide.\u201d) Davis remembers the dust being so thick that day he could see it. Other miners recalled the air belowground flowing in odd directions before the explosion. Blankenship\u2019s natural gas theory conveniently absolves him of the chronic failures investigators found. \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just not substantiated,\u201d said Celeste Monforton, a safety expert who was part of the independent panel, which also faulted federal and state regulators for not adequately policing Massey. \u201cIt was a coal dust explosion. The fingerprint mapping that was done to find a cause \u2015 all of that evidence indicated that,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the analytical work that was done, taking all the dust samples, an extraordinary amount of evidence showed that.\u201d Blankenship has also claimed that the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration forced Massey to change its ventilation plans before the explosion, suggesting MSHA may be to blame for the disaster. The independent panel found no evidence of that. However, it did find regulators failed at Upper Big Branch \u2015 by not cracking down hard enough on Massey. As Blankenship has blamed natural gas and MSHA for the disaster while on the campaign trail, Robert Atkins has been there to fact-check him. Atkins lost his son Jason at Upper Big Branch. He has made a point of showing up at Blankenship\u2019s town hall meetings to speak directly to undecided voters and rebut Blankenship\u2019s telling of events. He estimates he\u2019s gone to five campaign events and has spoken one-on-one with 50 voters, urging them to vote for anyone but Blankenship. His wife joined him for the first event, but couldn\u2019t do any more.\u00a0 \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Atkins said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve got in my head, and I feel I\u2019m right, that that man killed my son. And when he killed my son, it took the life out of me, out of his mom, and out of his brother. ... The man has no remorse.\u201d\u00a0 According to the independent panel, the deeper cause of the disaster was what they called \u201cthe Massey Way.\u201d Under Massey\u2019s corporate culture, miners were to run coal at all costs. The mine continued operating even when airflow was dangerously low. Workers lacked basic safety equipment while having to file regular production reports. Methane detectors were disabled to avoid having to shut down the mine if levels got too high. And workers were instructed to tip off colleagues belowground when federal safety inspectors showed up. Massey enforced this system through intimidation, investigators found. Workers testified after the explosion that they did what they were told because they feared for their jobs. Managers belittled miners who couldn\u2019t get with the program. The company had a slogan: \u201cS1 P2,\u201d for safety first and production second. According to Davis, the joke among miners was that it was really \u201cP1 S2.\u201d  As his ATV lurched up and down the ravines, Davis tried to explain the grip Blankenship had on his mines. He had worked at other Massey properties before Upper Big Branch. He remembers eating lunch out of his pocket as he worked, reluctant to slow production with a proper break. He didn\u2019t speak up about hazards, either, fearful of losing the job that he desperately needed. He recalled the pressure workers felt whenever Blankenship showed up in his car or helicopter. Someone would shout to him as he cut coal with the highwall miner machine: \u201cTommy, whatever it is you\u2019re cutting, keep it rolling. Do not stop. Do. Not. Stop.\u201d  \u201cThat money was feeding their kids and paying for their trucks. They were proud of that and didn\u2019t want to lose that,\u201d Davis said. \u201cDon Blankenship scared those people to death.\u201d\u00a0 *** Three Upper Big Branch managers went to prison before Blankenship, all found to have deceived regulators or investigators in covering up safety problems. Blankenship was charged with three counts: securities fraud, making false statements to officials, and conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found him guilty only of the latter charge.  Davis attended every day of the two-month trial that he could, making a point to sit near Blankenship\u2019s supporters. He wore the same outfit each day so Blankenship could better recognize him: a plaid shirt with a green jacket and an Under Armour hat. The one-year sentence handed down \u2015 the maximum the judge could impose under the misdemeanor conviction \u2015 infuriated Davis, considering Blankenship had been facing up to 30 years under the original charges. (The conspiracy charge was not directly linked to the disaster itself.) Outside the courthouse, a television reporter asked Davis why he was so frustrated. His raw and eloquent response, delivered with a quaking voice, would be viewed over a million times online: \u201cIf you was where I was that day, and you seen my son after laying in there for five days, and seen what he looked like \u2015 if you worked on them men like we did when they come outside, if you smelled them, and you looked at them, then you\u2019d know where I come from.\u201d  The 12-month sentence didn\u2019t make Blankenship any more penitent. He declared himself a political prisoner. He published a 67-page booklet from his low-security prison in California, proclaiming his innocence and propagating conspiracy theories about a government cover-up. He promoted a 2014 \u201cdocumentary\u201d he\u2019d funded, called \u201cUpper Big Branch \u2015 Never Again,\u201d faulting the feds for the disaster. He blamed Manchin personally for his prosecution, taking his feud to Twitter.  As West Virginia\u2019s governor, Manchin was at Upper Big Branch in the days following the explosion.\u00a0He and Davis have since become friends. Davis said he often gets a call from a number he keeps in his cell as \u201cSenator Joe,\u201d and it\u2019s Manchin asking how he\u2019s doing. They talk about motorcycles, Blankenship and whatever else Davis has on his mind. (Manchin\u2019s uncle died in the Farmington Mine Disaster, along with 77 others, in 1968.) Davis said Manchin\u2019s campaign has never asked anything of him, though he would happily oblige if it did, particularly if Blankenship wins the Republican nomination on May 8. \u201cHe\u2019s the only politician who\u2019s been there the whole time,\u201d Davis said of Manchin. \u201cHe won\u2019t say it, but I will.\u201d On a Thursday in mid-April, Davis learned that Blankenship would be attending a meet-the-candidates forum that night in Chelyan, just across the river from Davis\u2019 home. He was surprised the Senate hopeful would have the nerve to show up to a public event so close to Upper Big Branch, an area where Blankenship campaign signs appear to be sparse. Davis had told himself that he wouldn\u2019t attend town hall-style events, knowing he might lose control in an encounter with Blankenship. He decided to bend his rule. He removed the gun from his truck and told his buddy Gary Price to meet him down at the community center, where Blankenship would be. When Davis got there, a handful of police officers who already knew him came outside to greet him. They told Davis he could say whatever he wanted to Blankenship, so long as he kept some distance and didn\u2019t threaten him.  Davis took a sign from his truck and laid it across his windshield. It said: \u201cCory Davis 5/22/89 - 4/5/10. Don Blankenship murdered him over coal and money.\u201d Price parked his truck in front of the building\u2019s main exit, dragging a custom trailer that has a dedication to Cory on one side and the names of every miner killed at Upper Big Branch on the other. Davis waited outside to confront the candidate as he left the event. He saw Blankenship walk to the glass doors and stop, the memorial display laid out in front of him. Then he watched Blankenship turn and head toward another exit, accompanied by what appeared to be an aide. They hopped in a car and left, before any words could be exchanged with Davis. Another Republican candidate, Jack Newbrough, came out the doors to take a break. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, Tommy,\u201d he said, shaking Davis\u2019 hand. \u201cI sure would love to have your support.\u201d Davis let the invitation hang in the air. He thanked his friend Price for coming out, then headed to his truck and off to the bar to have a beer. Although there was no confrontation, he considered his trip to the forum a success. He felt he\u2019d shamed Blankenship for coming into his end of the valley. He noted that Blankenship never looked him in the eye. He believes the man feels guilt, despite everything he\u2019s said to the contrary. \u201cThat boy of mine, he can\u2019t speak out no more, so I speak out for him,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do it \u2015 to make sure Blankenship doesn\u2019t forget it. Just like I\u2019m sitting here thinking about him, now he\u2019s driving home thinking about Cory and those men.\u201d\u00a0'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

This blog addresses that question. For entrepreneurs, understanding what is constant and what is changing can give you an enormous competitive edge on those who don't. I'd love to know what YOU think won't change. Tweet your ideas to me @peterdiamandis with the hashtag #notchanging. The first time I heard this question answered was from Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos. Jeff was on stage at a press event, and a reporter asked him, \"Jeff, what do you think is going to change most in the next 10 years?\" Jeff replied, \"That's a good question. But a better question is: What's not going to change in the next 10-20 years?\" He went on to say that, from his perspective at Amazon, what won't change is people's desire for lower prices and faster delivery. Accordingly, Jeff built Amazon to focus on and invest billions into figuring out how to lower prices and increase the speed with which items are shipped to you. \"When you have something that you know is true,\" says Jeff, \"even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.\" My friend Tony Robbins often speaks about the six fundamental human needs. My guess is that these too will remain constant as long as we humans retain our current neurochemistry. The six basic human needs include: 1. Certainty: We need assurance that we can avoid pain and gain pleasure 2. Uncertainty/Variety: We have a need for variety, continuous change, and stimulus 3. Significance: We have a need to feel unique, important, and special 4, Connection/Love: We need a strong feeling of connection with people and we need to feel loved 5. Growth: We need to expand each of our own capabilities and capacities 6. Contribution: We need to contribute, and we need a sense of service and focus on giving back. I\u2019d also add a 7th to this list: 7.\u00a0The individual\u2019s desire for more freedom: We will constantly be looking for ways to achieve more freedom in our lives. One great example of this is the shift that\u2019s happening in freelance work. From designers on 99Designs to Uber drivers to independent consultants, more and more people are choosing \u201cfreelance\u201d career paths because doing so affords them freedom of time, location and association. While these needs will remain constant, the way we fulfill them will change. For entrepreneurs, to the extent that you can make achieving these basic needs easier or more fulfilling, people will preferentially adopt your approach. Which leads me to another key idea\u2026 As consumers, we will always adopt products and services that make our lives 10x better, easier or more fulfilling. Despite the fact that we are generally resistant to change, when the perceived change of a new product is an order of magnitude better, we predictably make the jump and never look back. This means that solving problems and creating value will always be in demand \u2013 and entrepreneurs are primed to do just this. If you've followed my blog or any of my work, you know that I believe that a LOT is going to change, driven by accelerating technologies, in the very near future. I'd love to know what YOU think won't change. Tweet your ideas to me @peterdiamandis with the hashtag #notchanging.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The new policy is meant to shine light on the previously undisclosed ways that politicians and other groups aim to shift public opinion on elections and political issues. But the self-regulatory approach will occur at Facebook\u2019s direction and without any public oversight. The social media giant will require all election-related ads and many issue-related political ads placed on its platform and on Instagram to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity, the advertising budget, how many people saw the advertisement and their demographic information \u2015 age, location and gender. Starting from May 7, 2018, all ads will remain in a searchable archive for seven years. Users will also be able to report advertising that they believe should be disclosed as political. The company says it will hire 3,000 to 4,000 content moderators to review these complaints, and will deploy machine-learning algorithms when possible. (You can read more about this plan on Facebook\u2019s blog.) In addition to ads that explicitly call for the election or defeat of a candidate, Facebook is also targeting issue-based advertising. The company explained in a blog post that it worked with the nonpartisan Comparative Agendas Project to select 20 issues that will be covered by the disclosure policy, ranging from abortion to foreign policy to Social Security. An ad calling for the Department of Education to ban the use of public student loans at for-profit colleges, for example,\u00a0would need to be disclosed. An ad run by a specific for-profit college that simply promoted the school would not. Facebook\u2019s new policy follows the company\u2019s revelation to Congress in 2017 that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian digital propaganda company that works with both the public and private sector in the country, purchased advertisements for a range of pages that sought to inflame American racial tensions and that, depending on the page, advocated for the election of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders. In some cases, these pages bought ads to gain followers in the U.S. and later called for voters to boycott the election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced plans to require political ad transparency in a speech from Facebook headquarters in September 2017. While Facebook\u2019s moves are supported by advocates of online political advertising disclosure, the new policy also highlights how the failure of elected officials and regulatory agencies to impose actual disclosure rules through the democratic process is enabling the private sector to assert its authority over the conduct of U.S. elections. Facebook\u2019s new disclosure plan is not bound by federal regulations and will not be overseen by the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. In 2014, Ann Ravel, then the chairwoman of the FEC, proposed a meeting to discuss the disclosure of online ads. Her Republican colleagues pilloried her for the suggestion, and conservative news sites claimed she was trying to destroy free speech and censor their views. Ravel received a torrent of anti-Semitic death threats, and the three FEC Republicans voted against a rule to mandate online ad disclosure. \u201cThe failure to regulate this space all together is a pretty abject failure,\u201d John Wonderlich, executive director of the pro-transparency nonprofit Sunlight Foundation, told HuffPost. \u201cSo, now we have private sector campaign finance regulation. That\u2019s a pretty dystopian present.\u201d The public is now left with the Facebook Election Commission \u2015 and maybe the Google Election Commission and the Twitter Election Commission. Both Google and Twitter have proposed some form of online ad disclosure on their respective platforms after they were also used by Russian trolls in 2016. For now, online political ad disclosure will be balkanized, as digital platforms will have different policies due to a lack of federal enforcement. In some cases, that may result in stronger disclosure requirements than Congress or the FEC would mandate, as seen with Facebook\u2019s broad issue-advertising disclosure approach. In other cases,\u00a0though, the lack of public enforcement will likely result in worse outcomes. Indeed, that is also the case with Facebook, which launched a searchable archive of political ads that is only accessible if you have a Facebook account. This means a person must submit to Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions, including the collection of personal data, if they want to learn about the election ads purchased by U.S. politicians. Rob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product, said on Twitter that the company is considering ways to open the archive to non-users. A Facebook spokesman said the company would not collect data on what people search for in the political ad archive in order to better target ads at them. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a lead sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill to officially mandate online ad disclosure, praised Facebook\u2019s decision in a tweet but noted the underlying problems of industry self-regulation. \u201cBig step in the right direction \u2015 and I\u2019m glad Facebook followed through on my recommendations to improve upon earlier proposals,\u201d Warner tweeted\u00a0Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ll be pushing other companies to follow suit. But until we pass the #HonestAds Act, there\u2019ll still be a patchwork of disclosure across social media.\u201d So far, the Republican-controlled Congress has refused to move the bill through committee or to the floor for a vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is a notorious opponent of any and all campaign finance regulation or disclosures. Meanwhile, commissioners on the FEC, the nation\u2019s actual election disclosure regulator, spent Thursday arguing over whether they should release a report on their 40th anniversary. That 40th anniversary was three years ago.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

According to a complaint filed by the FTC and the attorney general of New Jersey, Vizio began making TVs in 2014 that automatically tracked what people were watching. Older devices were retrofitted remotely through software updates, and all of the data was gathered without telling consumers and without their consent.\u00a0 Vizio eventually accumulated \u201cas many as 100 billion data points a day from millions of TVs,\u201d which it then sold to advertisers. \u201cConsumers didn\u2019t know that while they were watching their TVs, Vizio was watching them,\u201d the FTC wrote in a blog post following the settlement. The FTC detailed how the electronics giant used hidden tracking software to spy on its customers: On a second-by-second basis, Vizio collected a selection of pixels on the screen that it matched to a database of TV, movie and commercial content. What\u2019s more, Vizio identified viewing data from cable or broadband service providers, set-top boxes, streaming devices, DVD players and over-the-air broadcasts.

Vizio\u2019s contracts with third parties prohibited the re-identification of consumers and households by name, but allowed a host of other personal details \u2013 for example, sex, age, income, marital status, household size, education and home ownership. And Vizio permitted these companies to track and target its consumers across devices.

Then It Might Also Feel Like A Triangle.', body='A painter who hears\u00a0noise in colors. A musician who sees sounds in shapes. People who taste words.\u00a0These are just some examples of what it\u2019s like to have synesthesia \u2015 a condition where input received via one sense triggers a response from another sense, causing people to experience reduced boundaries between vision, hearing and other types of perception.  Now, a\u00a0study published Sept. 15 in the European Journal of Neuroscience suggests that simply having one type of synesthesia \u2015 for example, seeing colors in letters of the alphabet \u2015 is enough to blur the lines between other senses as well. \u201cIt shows that something about their synesthesia is spilling over into another domain,\u201d Dr. Krish Sathian, a neurologist at Emory University, said in a press release. The findings may help researchers pin down the exact cause of synesthesia, which remains mysterious. Are the brains of people with synesthesia wired differently from everyone else\u2019s?\u00a0Or are they simply ordinary brains doing what ordinary brains do, only more intensely? We don\u2019t yet have enough data to say for sure, but the new research suggests it may be the latter.\u00a0Most people, even those without synesthesia, make some implicit associations between different sensory features. We describe people\u2019s voices as \u201csharp\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d as if they\u2019re things we can touch.\u00a0Or we talk of painting a room in \u201cwarm\u201d colors. One famous example of these so-called cross-modal correspondences is the Bouba-Kiki effect, first observed by the psychologist Wolfgang K\u00f6hler in 1929. Experiments have shown that no matter what language someone speaks, he or she is more likely to assign the name \u201cbouba\u201d to a round-cornered shape and the name \u201ckiki\u201d to an angular shape than the other way around. \u201cSome argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences,\u201d the researchers note in this week\u2019s paper. \u201cOthers contend that the two are quite different.\u201d\u00a0 The people in the study had the most common form of synesthesia \u2015 a type known as grapheme-color synesthesia, which causes people to perceive colors in letters and numbers. But during tests, the researchers found that these people are also more likely than their non-synesthete peers to make associations between shapes and meaningless words. \u201cWe conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences,\u201d the researchers said. Synesthesia is thought to be rare, but estimates are highly variable and unclear. Anecdotally the condition has been linked to creativity, with some research backing it up.\u00a0One study in Australia\u00a0found 24 percent of synesthetes to be involved in an artistic profession. Among the general population, this figure falls to just 2 percent. It may be possible to learn synesthesia, by consciously trying to associate different sensory modalities, to improve your memory and creativity. And some researchers argue that true synesthetes, too, have learned the associations during childhood. One study last year found a link between the colors that some people see in letters and the colors of a popular brand of refrigerator magnets.\u00a0 That might be hard for synesthetes to believe, however, since they often perceive the letters in highly irregular, complex and almost otherworldly hues.\u00a0'}.

Dudzinski, who has studied the behavior and communication of the marine mammals since 1990, argues that more is needed for the verbal exchanges to be deemed a language. \u201cThis is an interesting study,\u201d she said of the Russian report in an email to The Huffington Post on Monday, \u201cbut the described experiment does not show that dolphins are transmitting complex semantic information to each other like what we see for human language.\u201d Dudzinski said the study instead showed similarities between dolphin communication and human language, which has long been seen. \u201cThere are a number examples of this in the scientific literature. However, the current weight of evidence suggests that dolphins do not have a language that functions in the same way as human language,\u201d she continued. \u201cThus, we feel this recent publication is not really a novel item and is unlikely to gain much traction with scientists/academics.\u201d\u00a0 One such article Dudzinski believes backs her argument is a 2013 piece published in the International Journal of Comparative Psychology, titled\u00a0\u201cAre Conversations Between Dolphins and Humans Possible?\u201d\u00a0The article addresses how communication and conversation aren\u2019t always the same thing. Justin Gregg, a senior research associate with the Dolphin Communication Project, similarly examined such a discussion in a 2006 article titled, \u201cDo Dolphins Have A Language?\u201d \u201c\u2026yes, language is a form of communication, but communication can happen in so many different ways \u2015 not just through language,\u201d he stated. Gregg went on to point out physical gestures and vocalizations used among animals, and humans, for communication, which don\u2019t necessarily form a language. Researchers studying dolphin communication in 2007 reported distinguishing nearly 200 different whistles from bottlenose dolphins. Some of the sounds were linked to specific behaviors. That led the lead researcher, Liz Hawkins, to conclude that dolphins do have their own language. \u201cThis communication is highly complex, and it is contextual, so in a sense, it could be termed a language,\u201d she told New Scientist at the time.'}.

In doing so, the IOC clearly showed its preference for the country that elected Emmanuel Macron to preside over the games, instead of the one that chose Donald Trump, despite a strong bid by L.A. and the city\u2019s history in hosting successful games. On paper, the City of Angels had the stronger bid than the City of Lights. Los Angeles had hosted two successful Olympic Games: 1932 and 1984. In fact, unlike so many recent financial failures, cost overruns, abandoned facilities and inadequate venues, the California city demonstrated that it is a perfect site for the 2024 Olympics. \u201cLos Angeles, however, is almost a model Olympic city,\u201d wrote Travis Waldron on HuffPost. \u201cIt turned a small profit in 1984, and even Olympic skeptics have said that the city\u2019s bid is financially sound and unlikely to lead to the kind of massive cost overruns that so many other hosts have experienced.\u201d Paris, meanwhile, has not hosted an Olympic Games since 1924. It had lost out on several earlier Olympic bids, and was beginning to look like a persistent \u201calso-ran\u201d or \u201cfrequent candidate\u201d in the race to host the international games. Yet Macron is the one flashing the thumbs up, while Trump, who tweeted about his work to land the 2024 Olympics, isn\u2019t. And their politics may have a lot to do with that. As Adam Taylor with The Washington Post noted, Macron touted his country\u2019s values at the Olympic meeting in Lausanne, something Trump skipped. \u201cWe need multilateralism, the structures that provide agreement among nations\u2026and tolerance, which the Olympic movement illustrates well,\u201d the French President said. \u201cOlympic values are our values.\u201d If he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019ll play the host to the 2024 Olympic Games. As Michael Bastasch with The Daily Caller added, \u201cMacron is determined to bring the games to a country that embodies \u2018openness, tolerance and respect for the environment,\u2019\u201d an open reference to his country\u2019s support for the Paris Agreement, something President Trump openly rejected, claiming he was dedicated to protecting Pittsburgh, and not Paris. Trump\u2019s verbal attacks on Mexico and his decision to build the wall and put travel bans on several countries, is unpopular worldwide, and even in America as well. He has clashed with many world leaders, even backing Macron\u2019s ultranationalistic rival. His \u201cAmerica First,\u201d slogan might play well in Ocala, Florida, might not in the Olympic Committee, which likely cringed at the prospect of a Trump in his last year in office (if reelected) giving a long speech similar to the Boy Scout lecture in July. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti seemed to understand the importance of international cooperation in his city\u2019s bid to host the Olympics. As Taylor with the Washington Post reported \u201cGarcetti stressed that the city aims to make the games economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers\u2019 money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children throughout the city.\u201d And Garcetti noted his city\u2019s support for the Paris Climate Agreement. As a result, L.A. was awarded the 2028 Olympics, much earlier than many such bids are usually given. It seems as though the IOC really wanted the Olympics to return to Los Angeles as soon as possible, on the anniversary of the highly successful 2024 games. But they couldn\u2019t swallow the specter of Trump calling for the crowd to boo domestic rivals, bragging about this big electoral win, and making inappropriate references or nationalistic appeals.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='Main Streets, Malls And Sustainable Consumption', body='We are in the midst of a number of fundamental changes in the nature of work and in the way we spend our time when we\u2019re not working. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce now accounts for about 8.9% of all retail sales, a number that continues to grow; second quarter 2017 e-commerce sales were about 5% higher than first quarter sales. More of what we buy is bought online, but we are also buying less merchandise. Rents for commercial real estate continue to decline and it is obvious that we have a lot of empty storefronts in well-off parts of New York City and in shopping malls around America. More and more of our time is spent doing things rather than accumulating things.  About 80% of the U.S. GDP and the U.S. employment market is in the service sector of the economy. In fact, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: Americans spend a growing amount of their time making and consuming services. From physical therapy to movies, from concerts to nail salons, American\u2019s consumption patterns are changing. As a proportion of our total consumption, food, clothing and other merchandise are declining while services are growing. It\u2019s not that we no longer require material possessions, but that the nature and style of consumption is changing. Real estate development is beginning to reflect the growth of e-commerce and the service economy. One victim of this change is the suburban shopping mall. This past spring, Hayley Peterson of Business Insider observed that: The real estate industry has taken note of these changes by repurposing existing malls and cancelling or scaling back new ones. In a Wall Street Journal article published last week, Keiko Morris reported that: While many people remain attracted to single family, detached homes and separation of residential and commercial space, a growing number of young people are attracted to more walkable environments where they can live, work and shop in a single area. Walking, biking or hopping on a train seem to be viable alternatives to sitting in endless and growing traffic jams. Hanging out in a public park seems to be a reasonable alternative to mowing the lawn. With the growth of global commerce and communication, we have seen a degree of homogenization of material goods and commercial experiences. One reaction to that trend is a desire to find or build local communities of distinct character. A \u201cMain Street\u201d style of commercial development doesn\u2019t require two big anchor department stores and dozens of national chains. It can evolve over time and adjust its mix of residential, commercial and business spaces. Commercial space can be priced to enable small, distinct local retail shops. A sense of place is difficult to convey within a giant enclosed space surrounded by acres of parking lots. Malls tend to all look the same because their economic function and business model dictate a particular design. Main street type developments, like cities, can evolve over time and take into account local needs, markets, culture and geography. The density achieved through these Main Street developments makes it possible to achieve the economy of scale required for new infrastructure that is environmentally sustainable. Microgrids can be installed to permit the use of renewable energy and ensure energy efficiency. This can reduce the cost of a development\u2019s operation and maintenance.  Microgrids also provide resiliency because they can operate when the central grid is blacked- out. The use of permeable surfaces such as plantings in street medians, green roofs and unpaved parklands can reduce flood impacts while creating an amenity. The development\u2019s design can take drainage into account and take advantage of the natural contours of the land. The cost effectiveness of water supply, sewage treatment and waste management can be enhanced by carefully designed, concentrated urban developments. The trend toward a sharing economy is also facilitated by urban density. Sharing clothing, cars, furniture and other material goods is easier when people live close together. The cultural switch from material consumption as a means rather than an end is well underway, and sharing material goods enables a less resource intensive economy. It is gradually becoming less socially desirable to be seen laden with shopping bags at the mall. That sort of Kardashian-like behavior is seen by some as a form of gluttony. If the goods you really need are delivered to your home in over-packed Amazon boxes, then the act of \u201cshopping\u201d is no longer recreation, but simply a less notable chore required to obtain a commodity.  This social change toward urbanization and different forms of consumption is never uniform and older people in particular cling to their familiar and comfortable lifestyles. In the United States the price of housing remains the one material possession that still requires a substantial part of a family\u2019s annual income. In many parts of the country, the best housing buys are in the outer rings of suburbia where single family development and the auto culture is the norm. That pattern will persist and will probably be reinforced once electric cars become cheaper and more reliable than internal combustion powered vehicles. But even in these areas we are seeing multi-story condo-style development and Main Street-alternatives to traditional malls. The pull of a new cultural norm, experiencing rather than consuming, could be long lasting. Its physical manifestation in patterns of land use development is difficult to predict. Environmentalists and climate activists often make the case that consumption of some material goods must be sacrificed on the altar of environmental sustainability. SUVs, motorboats, and red meat are typical targets. Opposing consumption that people like is politically perilous, particularly if that case is being made by well-educated coastal elites. It can come off as particularly arrogant when seen through the eyes of an out-of-work or underemployed Midwestern factory worker, who would love to have the problem of over-consumption. The issue is avoided if the trend toward different rather than less consumption holds.  While it\u2019s never a good idea to predict the future, the growth of the service economy, the impact of e-commerce on real estate development, and the growth of the sharing economy are each undeniable. New technologies will continue to change consumption patterns, land use and social norms. We don\u2019t know what shape it will take, but I believe we have an opportunity to ensure these changes result in an exciting sustainable life style in a new type of sustainable city.'}.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an article classification bot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is the title and body of an article {title='The Euro May Already Be Lost', body='This entry has been co-written with Dr. Heikki Koskenkyl\u00e4 and Dr. Peter Nyberg.  The 1st of January 2017 marked the 18th anniversary of the European common currency, the euro. Despite its success from 1999 to 2007, after 2008 the euro has become a burden for many of its members. For example, living standards in Italy and Greece are below the levels when they joined the euro. Finland is the only Nordic country using the euro and it is also the only Nordic country which has not yet recovered from the financial crash of 2008. There have been many proposals on how to fix the euro and the EMU, but they are politically unpopular and unrealistic. In this blog-entry, we will argue that the euro will almost surely fail; we just do not know the exact timing of its demise.  Problems of the euro are structural and persistent The problem of the euro can be visualized in the development of the GDP per capita (see Figure 1). Germany has been successful in the Eurozone, while Greece and Italy have not. France is not doing well either. The jury is still out for Finland.  The different growth paths are a symptom of a general problem that has haunted currency unions for centuries. Competitiveness and productivity develop at a different pace in different countries. Over time, this leads to large competitiveness differences among the members of a currency union. These differences do not usually pose a problem during economic booms, because strengthening aggregate demand supports ailing fields of production. However, when a currency union faces an economic downturn or a crisis, falling aggregate demand hits less competitive industries and countries hard and the financing costs of less competitive countries jump. This is an asymmetric shock. The detrimental effects of asymmetric shocks can be mitigated by transferring funds from prosperous to declining member states. When the dollar union of the US threatened to fall apart during the Great Depression, federal government enacted federal income transfers from prosperous states to aid ailing ones.  The federal budget also increased rapidly and, in practice, income transfers became permanent. The no bailout policy of crisis-hit states had already been enacted earlier.  According to the ECB, competitiveness of the German economy has improved by around 19.3 percent, Greece\u2019s competitiveness has improved by around 6.5 percent, France\u2019s around 3.9 percent, Finland\u2019s around 1.7 percent and Italy\u2019s around 0.9 percent since 1999 . Thus, the differences in competitiveness are large. For survival in its present form and size the Eurozone needs a similar income transfer system, that is, a full political union as in the US.  There is no European-wide polling data on a political union, but it appears that the support for the EU is diminishing in its core. In a recent survey, 40 percent of Finns wanted to leave the EU. Also, only 53 percent of Dutch are against a new referendum on the EU, which means that 47 percent are either for it or do not know their stand. For permanent income transfers, you would need to change the Maastricht Treaty and ratify it in each member country or to negotiate several bilateral agreements. There is only a very small likelihood that these would go through, for example, in Finland and in the Netherlands.  Funds, unions and reality Because there is no public support for a federal European Union, many have envisaged alternative ways to fix the euro. The CEO of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Klaus Regling has proposed that euro could be saved by a combination of the banking and capital market union and a rainy day fund. This fund would allegedly be used when asymmetric shocks occur. The fund would be financed jointly by all euro countries. However, because of the persistent differences in competitiveness, its transfers would become permanent, like in the US. Only the most competitive members of the Eurozone would have sufficient income to finance the fund. Any financing through the European Central Bank (ECB), would need to be covered by European tax-payers later, when it would become evident that weaker countries are unable to pay back their loans and when seigniorage revenues would be unable to cover the losses of the ECB.  Thus, in practice, there are only two ways to fix the euro: A far-reaching political union proposed in the Five President\u2019s report in 2015 or returning to the system described in the Maastricht Treaty, where member states would be responsible for their own economies only (no bail-out).  In a full political union, there would be concentration of economic policy decision making and it would require major structural changes in the Eurozone and its member countries. Tax and social policies would be unified, labor unions would be dismantled or unified as a European-wide system, a European debt relief system and banking union would be set up. These would ensure the flexibility of wages, prices and labor agreements and guarantee convergence of competitiveness and living standards. This could work, in theory. But, the likelihood of getting all the member states to agree that their wages, debt and living conditions would be negotiated at the European level is extremely small.  Returning to the Maastricht Treaty and to the no bail-out rule would mean that persistent differences in living standards and market based debt restructurings would be enacted. ESM and the European Financial Stability Facility would be wound down after their current programs would end. ECB support (QE and OMT) programs would stop. This would lead to the default of Greece and its likely exit from the euro. In the long-run, asymmetric shocks and persistent income differences would be likely to force several additional countries to leave the euro.  The Eurozone is in a stalemate. A federal union would be needed to fix its problems, but there is no public support for it. Returning to national fiscal responsibility would lead to defaults and exits. Half-way solutions will prove insufficient but expensive and obfuscate the issues. Therefore, there may be no way to avert the partial or complete break-up of the Eurozone in the years to come. The fate of the euro may already have been sealed.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

This Player Is Focused On What Happens Next.', body='\u201cI tell all the guys: The NFL stands for \u2018Not For Long,\u2019\u201d says defensive end Ricky Jean Francois, who recently signed with the Green Bay Packers. Jean Francois wasn\u2019t supposed to be an exception to that rule. A seventh-round draft pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2009, Jean Francois \u2015 now on his fourth contract with his fourth team \u2015 just completed his seventh season. Sustaining a career in the NFL is not easy.\u00a0The average career lasts just over 3 years, the lowest of any of the four main sports in the U.S., and that includes practice squad players who never even play in a game. Also, NFL contracts are not guaranteed, meaning players \u2015 even stars \u2015 can be cut at any time. Before inking a deal with the Packers, Jean Francois enjoyed two productive seasons with the Washington Redskins, playing in all 32 possible games, seven of which he started, while recording 57 tackles, including 3.5 sacks. Just how rare is such production from a seventh-round selection? According to a 2015 study by Forbes, the median of \u201cpercentage of games started\u201d by seventh-round picks from the 2010 draft from 2010-2015 is 0 percent. In other words, the mere fact that Jean Francois has become a starter while more than doubling the NFL career average is almost unheard of. As a result, the tech-obsessed 30-year-old \u2015 who was cut by Washington despite having one more year on his contract \u2015 has a unique perspective when looking ahead to life after pro football. Despite being a star player and winning a national title at college football powerhouse Louisiana State University, he knew the odds of a career weren\u2019t especially high.\u00a0 Developing his business acumen became a priority for him early on. \u201cDuring my rookie season, I spent a lot of money,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Do I really want to be this type of guy?\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to just spend money, because you won\u2019t get it back. ...\u00a0The next year you couldn\u2019t pay me to spend a dime. \u201cAfter I signed a contract with the Colts [in 2013], I realized that I needed a retirement plan.\u201d\u00a0 According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, 78 percent of NFL players go broke within three years of retirement and 15.7 percent file for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement. The 6-foot-3, 313-pound Jean Francois \u2015 this year\u2019s proud recipient of the Redskins\u2019 Media Good Guy Award \u2015 did not want to become one of those statistics. So Jean Francois started to ask around the league \u2015 talking to veterans, coaches and anyone who would offer advice. He started to educate himself, going through an assortment of different business and economic publications.\u00a0Forbes, Fortune and Bloomberg are his favorites. With the help of his financial manager, he then purchased a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts location in Georgia.\u00a0Before long, he owned 25 franchises throughout the South, and he still has plans to expand to Houston.\u00a0He committed himself to the business in every offseason, understanding the nuances of the business as he would an NFL playbook. At first, it was a grueling process, learning about projections and parsing through spreadsheets.\u00a0But soon, it became second nature. He still feels a thrill every time one of his stores beats the sales projections. \u201cIt opened up another world I didn\u2019t know existed,\u201d Jean Francois adds.\u00a0 \u201cI have to be hands-on so I can see everything grow. I gotta learn how to do it myself.\u201d When challenges \u2015 such as consistency in the product and service \u2015 presented themselves, Jean Francois leaned on his football background and his experience working with a team. But he\u2019s never had a problem with a single employee. \u201cFootball helped me mentally, because I had to get my mind right,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking sure everybody has a positive vibe,\u201d Jean Francois says, is paramount. \u201cI gotta make sure that I set the mindset of people in there to be happy. Teamwork is the most important thing. It can make things work better.\u00a0In other words, if football is a brotherhood, business is a community. \u201c[Business] helped me become a better person,\u201d he says. \u201cBusiness makes you open up as a person, because now you\u2019re more well-rounded. Early on in the NFL, you get influenced by the Rolls-Royces, the Ferraris, the Lambos. The next thing you know, you\u2019re broke and out of the league.\u201d And while business has made Jean Francois smarter and more focused, it was the birth of his son six months ago that changed his perception of life.\u00a0 \u201cMy son \u2015 when he looks at me, I want to be the right father figure,\u201d Jean Francois says. \u201cHe inspires me. I thought I grew up already, but when he came along, I was like, \u2018Okay, I really didn\u2019t grow up.\u2019 When I look at him, it all makes sense.\u201d These days, Jean Francois \u2015 who is of Haitian descent \u2015 sees inspiration everywhere, including in frequent trips to the small Caribbean island nation as a means of giving back to local communities in need. But the question still remains: What will life after football look like? His $3 million deal with the Packers is only for the 2017-18 season. Then,\u00a0he\u2019s not sure where he\u2019s headed, but he does have one big idea, despite lacking any tangible experience within the stock market. \u201cI\u2019d like start a hedge fund,\u201d Jean Francois says. Another option, though, is heading back to school. He wants to earn an Executive MBA in his hometown at the University of Miami, through a new Artists and Athletes program that has drawn rave reviews. Created in 2015 and aimed in large part toward football players, it employs a schedule that allows players to train early in the morning before going to nine hours of classes complemented by late-night study sessions. To be sure, it\u2019s no easy task, but Jean Francois certainly thinks it can be done. Fellow defensive end Carlos Dunlap for instance, earned Pro Bowl honors for the Cincinnati Bengals this year, while also completing his MBA.

The nagging mystery would send Robinson walking over 2,000 miles from Austin, Texas, to Boston with his other two dogs to raise awareness for canine cancer. It would also inspire his launch of an organization devoted to finding an answer -- through the discovery of links between dog and human tumors.  \"Breast cancer was the first cancer we funded,\" said Robinson, co-founder of the nonprofit 2 Million Dogs. \"Under a microscope, a mammary tumor from a dog and from a person look the same.\" As the prolific pink ribbons seek to remind us this month, breast cancer's grip remains strong and its reach ever-expanding. One in eight women in the U.S. will now face the diagnosis -- a rise of 40 percent in just one generation.  Perhaps less well-known, however, is that most breast cancers are not hereditary and that cancer is the leading disease-related killer of dogs, with mammary tumors the most common type afflicting females. (Early spaying significantly reduces the risk of such tumors.) These facts, combined with mounting evidence of harm posed by  certain chemicals -- used on carpets, couches, food bowls, squeaky toys and manicured lawns enjoyed by people and pets -- has led some experts and advocates to recommend a shift in breast cancer research and funding.  Only about 10 percent of breast cancer research dollars are devoted to its environmental causes, according to a federal interagency report published in February. \"Dogs drink our same water, they are exposed to the same toxins,\" Robinson said. \"The logical assumption is that indeed there is an environmental basis for these cancers. But a lot of research and funding comes from pharmaceutical companies. And there's no money in cause and prevention.\" Overall, growing interest in canine cancer has led to new comparative oncology research at the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University, with financial help from 2 Million Dogs. Investigators are treating shelter dogs that have developed mammary cancer, while gleaning information about the progression of the disease. The researchers hope to identify treatments that will benefit both dogs and humans. Penn veterinarians previously studied dogs involved in Sept. 11 search and rescue missions thought to be exposed to chemicals in the rubble. They found no elevated rates of major health problems in the decade after the attack.  Dr. Rodney Page, director of the Flint Animal Cancer Center and professor of medical oncology at Colorado State University, said his canine research is the only U.S. study underway aimed at identifying potential environmental risk factors for cancer and other diseases. The study, which began in September 2012, is attracting interest from federal agencies, including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study will eventually enroll 3,000 puppies from across the U.S. and follow them for several years. Investigators will collect DNA, urine, feces, fur and toenail clippings from the dogs that may show chemical exposures, and will ask owners questions about their pets' reproductive cycles and living habits. Page noted that his team has been enrolling spayed and unspayed dogs in order to better tease out the role of hormones in breast cancer cases and to ensure enough cases of breast cancer in the study.  \"This is a unique opportunity and could provide a wealth of information,\" said Page. Owner questionnaires are quite detailed, asking such things as dog chew toy descriptions, sleeping material details, dog food ingredients and food bowl composition. Page said time is a key advantage of studying dogs. While humans may develop cancer at an average age of 60, the average age of diagnosis for a dog is age 6. And, of course, there are a lot of dogs around to study: about one mutt for every four Americans. \"By combining -- on any environmental exposure issue -- humans and dogs in the same location, you can make a bigger case for the potential impact or abatement of a particular thing,\" said Page, who once mapped cases of pet cancer in Long Island during an investigation of a potential human breast cancer cluster.  Another surprising benefit of studying dogs is their mouths, according to Sharima Rasanayagam, director of science for the nonprofit Breast Cancer Fund. Both dogs and humans can absorb chemicals under the tongue. Lab animals, such as the mice commonly used in studies of toxic chemical exposures, only absorb through their stomachs. The sublingual route results in far higher levels of exposure, reported authors of a study published in June on dogs exposed to bisphenol A, a hormone-disrupting chemical known as BPA.  BPA and phthalates, key ingredients in many plastics and vinyls, may readily leach from some dog toys, according to a separate study published in November.  \"We're really living in a soup of chemicals,\" said Rasanayagam. \"Not only do you have carcinogens that can directly cause cancer, but you also have endocrine disruptors that can set you up for an increased risk.\" Last month, the Breast Cancer Fund published a report linking prenatal exposure to BPA to later-life diseases, such as breast cancer.  This month, the organization launched a Beyond the Pink campaign to prioritize prevention.  \"The pink movement has been fantastic in raising awareness and helping people who get breast cancer to move towards a cure and give them hope,\" said Rasanayagam. \"But what we would love would be for fewer people to get that diagnosis in the first place.\" \"I think we have a lot to learn from our companion animals,\" Rasanayagam added. Virginia McPhail participated in one of 2 Million Dogs' Puppy Up! fundraising walks last year in Kansas. Her Alaskan Malamute, Storm, was diagnosed with cancer at the same age as Robinson's Malcolm -- and the same week that McPhail's daughter, Mandi Steele, also received the dreaded diagnosis. That Christmas, in 2005, she recalled Storm and Mandi commiserating.  \"Both didn't feel good. Both did hurt,\" McPhail said. Mandi died less than a month later from a neuroendocrine carcinoma. Despite a prognosis of six months to a year, Storm went on to live another five years with multiple myeloma. \"He was my lifeline,\" said McPhail. \"I think Storm was left there for me.\" McPhail shared her suspicion that chemicals in the environment may have played a role in both illnesses. Storm would play in the ditches and run through the local farm fields, she said.  Dr. Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, a cardiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, devoted a chapter of her book, Zoobiquity, and much of an upcoming conference, to comparing cancers and possible causes across species.  Breast cancer has been found in animals ranging from kangaroos and koalas to water buffalo and beluga whales, Natterson-Horowitz said. \"Unfortunately, almost all physicians are quite unaware that nonhuman animals suffer from most of our human problems,\" said Natterson-Horowitz. \"And there could not be a bigger medical problem than breast cancer.\" Dr. Larry Norton, one of the nation's foremost breast oncologists, may be an exception.  He said he keeps an eye on mammary cancers in our mammalian cousins -- including our domestic four-footed friends -- and believes the information these creatures provide may be \"potentially transformative\" for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. He will participate in a panel on the topic at the Zoobiquity conference next month in New York. Not only do mammary tumors in dogs and humans look much the same, but they behave \"identically,\" forming masses, building blood vessels, spreading through the body and destroying normal functions, said Norton, deputy physician-in-chief for breast cancer programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,  \"Mammals are mammals are mammals,\" Norton added. \"We learn a lot from observing the whole collection of animals, and life on earth in general. One is relevant to the other.\"'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Apple Inc and the FBI returned to Washington to testify before lawmakers about their heated disagreement over law enforcement access to encrypted devices, highlighted in the case of an iPhone used by a gunman in last December's Islamist militant-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, California. The Federal Bureau of Investigation retreated last month from its high-profile pursuit of a court order that compelled Apple to help the agency unlock an iPhone 5c phone used by shooter Rizwan Farook. A still secret third party helped the government hack into it. But the U.S. Department of Justice redoubled its efforts last week to use the courts to force Apple's cooperation in cracking encrypted iPhones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in an unrelated New York drug case. The problems posed by increasingly prevalent strong default encryption are affecting federal and local law enforcement investigations across the country, Amy Hess, executive assistant director for science and technology at the FBI, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Tuesday. Law enforcement officials and Apple executives previously testified to Congress on March 1. Thomas Galati, chief of intelligence at the New York Police Department, said his investigators had been unable to open 67 Apple devices in a six-month period from October 2015 to March 2016. Those phones were implicated in 44 violent crimes 23 felonies, including ten homicides, two rapes, and an episode where an on-duty officer was shot, Galati said. Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell was testifying on a separate panel before the committee, in which he would argue that any vulnerability built into its products would harm all of its users. The shroud of secrecy still cloaking the method used on the San Bernardino phone has prompted criticism from security researchers who said Apple and others should be made aware of the flaw, in accordance with a White House vulnerabilities review process that favors disclosure. But Obama administration sources have told Reuters the group that helped unlock the device has sole ownership of the method, making it highly unlikely the technique would be disclosed by the government to Apple or any other entity. \"I don't think relying on a third party is a good model,\" said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the committee's top Democrat. The FBI relies heavily on the \"services and specialized skills that we can only get through the private industry, and that partnership is critical to our success,\" the FBI's Hess testified.

Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned. When asked if Whole Foods will add \u201cconsumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola,\u201d Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, \u201cAs you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don\u2019t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there\u2019s always that consideration.\u201d Amazon declined to comment. In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, \u201clove at first sight.\u201d And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members. But the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear? Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods \u201cfree of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats,\u201d according to its\u00a0website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version. Amazon\u2019s plan to change Whole Foods\u2019 shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant\u2019s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon\u2019s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier \u2014 the biggest in two years. While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart\u2019s 25% and Kroger\u2019s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June. Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks. \u201cWhole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can\u2019t scale and be profitable,\u201d says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t want to maintain the status quo. They can\u2019t see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.\u201d Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter. \u201cIf that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers,\u201d a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.\u201d But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods.

Here are the highlights.\u00a0 The statistic Trump cited comes from the Crime Prevention Research Center, which claims that,\u00a0in a span of more than six decades, 98 percent of mass shootings occurred in \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\u00a0 Take it with a big grain of salt: The study was authored by John Lott, a gun rights advocate and author of a recent\u00a0controversial\u00a0New York Times op-ed on background checks. The meaning of the statistic heavily depends on how both \u201cmass shooting\u201d\u00a0and \u201cgun-free zone\u201d are defined. An official definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d doesn\u2019t exist, and there\u2019s a lot of debate over which incidents count and which don\u2019t. The FBI stipulates that\u00a0three or more people must be killed for the term to apply, but Lott defined it as four or more deaths in public. By doing so, he discounted private residences where domestic violence-related shootings have occurred. He also did not count shootings that were \u201cpart of another crime,\u201d such as a robbery.\u00a0 There\u2019s also no official way to define \u201cgun-free zone,\u201d which may apply to places where civilians can\u2019t carry firearms but officials can. The way Lott chose to define it in his research is questionable; for example, he considered military sites like Fort Hood to be \u2018gun-free zones,\u2019 even though guns are clearly present there. That gun-carrying civilians lead to crime prevention is an old NRA talking point: A good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. Experts\u00a0strongly dispute\u00a0this idea. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded in 2005 that \u201cno link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data.\u201d PolitiFact deemed the statistic Trump cited Friday only \u201chalf-true.\u201d \u201cThere is no sign more inviting to a mass killer than a sign that declares that this school is a gun-free zone,\u201d Trump said at the convention, repeating his proposal to arm some teachers\u00a0and school security guards. HuffPost\u2019s Rebecca Klein spoke to teachers and law enforcement officials about Trump\u2019s idea and found many of them were against it, including the national teachers unions. Many worried that such a policy would do more harm than good and lead to a lot of students being injured by accident at school.\u00a0 \u201cAnyone who hasn\u2019t received the extensive training provided to law enforcement officers will likely be mentally unprepared to take a life, especially the life of a student assailant,\u201d Mo Canady, the executive director of the National Association for School Resource Officers, said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on in Chicago, but Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country,\u201d Trump said Friday. Trump and others in the pro-gun crowd have long held up crime rates in Chicago as evidence that gun control doesn\u2019t work. Although both Illinois and its largest city do have strong gun laws,\u00a0Chicago is a short drive from both Wisconsin and Indiana, where laws are significantly weaker. Studies have found that most of the guns used in crimes in Chicago come from out of state, with many coming from much farther away. Beyond that, Trump\u2019s comments ignore the fact that homicides and shootings in Chicago have actually been on the decline for more than a year. In 2017, Chicago had the ninth-highest homicide rate of any U.S. city. \u201cParis, France, has the toughest gun laws in the world,\u201d said Trump, going on to explain how a small group of terrorists armed with AK-47s \u201cbrutally killed\u201d more than 130 people in the French capital in 2015. \u201cIf one employee or just one patron had a gun \u2026 the terrorists would have fled or been shot, and it would\u2019ve been a whole different story.\u201d This is another of Trump\u2019s favorite talking points, which he\u2019s been using since the November 2015 Bataclan massacre. Putting aside for a second the absolute chaos that might have ensued if an arena full of armed concertgoers had decided to open fire on their assailants in the pitch dark, Trump is also leaving out some broader context.  With its strong gun laws, the overall firearm death rate in France is about one-quarter of what it is in the U.S. Although violent crime is not unheard of in Paris, the city experiences just a fraction of the homicides that an American city of a comparable population does. Gun homicides also appear to be primarily an issue among rival criminal gangs. \u201cI recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle, is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,\u201d said Trump. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right, they don\u2019t have guns, they have knives, and instead there\u2019s blood all over the floors of this hospital.\u201d We\u2019re not really sure what Trump\u2019s point is here. If he\u2019s noting that all violence is not gun violence, then sure. But the fact that Londoners are making it to hospitals to receive care is significant. Knives tend to be less lethal than guns, and it\u2019s far easier to injure or kill larger numbers of people, often indiscriminately or unintentionally, by shooting than it is by stabbing. A recent study in the U.S. found that more gunshot victims are dying before reaching the emergency room than they were a decade ago, even as trauma care has improved. One theory for this trend is an increasing \u201cintensity\u201d of violence, suggesting people may be getting shot more times, at closer range, with higher-caliber rounds, or simply while farther from the nearest hospital.

But President Donald Trump\u2019s caravan prosecutions are already hitting roadblocks. Lawyers are challenging most of the normally open-and-shut misdemeanor immigration prosecutions and using the president\u2019s tweets and public statements about Central Americans to do it.\u00a0 The severity of the cases hardly matches the outsized pronouncements from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Prosecutors have offered to release most of the 11 migrants based on time served if they agree to plead guilty. Then they would then take their claims to immigration court, having their currently clean criminal records stained with a conviction.\u00a0 In an unusual step, though,\u00a0at least six of the 11 alleged caravan members are seeking to have their cases dismissed entirely, contending the Trump administration selectively prosecuted them based on their national origin as it sought to deter Central American asylum seekers. Some secured reduced bonds, which may allow them to fight their cases without being jailed.\u00a0 Run-of-the-mill immigration prosecutions are rarely celebrated with press releases and statements from the attorney general, as these were. Sessions\u2019 actions have done something he likely didn\u2019t intend: He\u2019s given them the right to a court-appointed attorney and new legal defenses for cases that have historically been extremely difficult to win.  The 11 migrants, three women and eight men, were arrested in late April\u00a0and accused by Border Patrol agents of taking part in a caravan of hundreds of Central American asylum seekers. The caravan organizers dispute that, saying the 228 people who had crossed through the port of entry at San Ysidro in San Diego to make asylum claims were the only ones officially affiliated with their group. The Department of Justice filed criminal charges against the 11 on April 30. The prosecutions were unusual because three involved mothers traveling with their children, and at least five plan to seek asylum \u2014 two categories the government had typically put directly into civil immigration proceedings rather than filing criminal charges.\u00a0But they promise to become more common after Sessions implemented a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy this month, calling for the referral of all migrants arrested at the border for prosecution, with the express intent of separating families who cross illegally.\u00a0 Although immigrants are deported on the orders of immigration judges in civil courts, crossing into the United States illegally is a crime. The first offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison; subsequent offenses can be punished with up to 20 years in prison, depending on the person\u2019s criminal history. Because of the threat of long sentences and the ease with which prosecutors can win at trial \u2014 all they need to secure a conviction is an affidavit signed by a Border Patrol agent or documentation showing a previous deportation \u2014 defendants almost always plead guilty. And public defenders rarely urge immigration defendants to go to trial, knowing that their clients would likely remain jailed while their cases play out because they often can\u2019t afford to post bond.\u00a0 But the original $10,000 bonds sought by the government have already been reduced in several of the \u201ccaravan\u201d cases. A judge ordered Thursday that Olga George of Honduras could be released on an unsecured $5,000 bond without requiring a deposit \u2014 just her signature. In another case, Morena Mendoza\u2019s bond dropped from $10,000 to $5,000, and the judge allowed her to be freed with a $500 deposit, according to court filings.  In both of those cases, lawyers argued that their clients are not flight risks because they are seeking asylum in the United States. Judges had lowered bond for three others by Thursday. In some cases, the judges allowed the migrants to be freed with a co-signature from someone with enough money to pay a lowered bond of $5,000,\u00a0instead of requiring a deposit.\u00a0 In all of the contested cases, court-appointed lawyers argue that the judges should dismiss the charges based on what they say is selective prosecution by the government. Five of the migrants being prosecuted were traveling in a group of 18 people, including three Indian nationals, and the Border Patrol arrested all of them. But only four Hondurans and a Guatemalan in that group were charged \u2015 and none of the Indians \u2015 becoming part of the group of 11 publicized prosecutions. (The government has not revealed the identities of the others in the group, although attorneys asked them to do so as part of discovery.) All of the 11 alleged caravan members being prosecuted are from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\u00a0 \u201cThis kind of invidious discrimination based on alleged country of origin is forbidden by the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause,\u201d Eric Fish, a federal public defender in San Diego representing several of the migrants, wrote in one of the court filings.  To prove that there is selective prosecution, Fish and another court-appointed attorney, Richard Boesen, pointed in court filings to the words of Trump condemning the caravan and the U.S. asylum process.\u00a0 Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. \u201cCaravans\u201d coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! They listed several of Trump\u2019s tweets raging against the asylum-seeker caravan,\u00a0composed mostly of Central Americans, and ones singling out Honduras and Mexico, which the filings characterized as \u201ctwo of the countries whose migrants he desired to keep out of the United States.\u201d'}.

We were there as Miami's culinary entrepreneurs, speaking to other women who have or are looking to start their own business. There I was, soulful plant-based food writer and advocate, with Dena Marino of MC Kitchen, Feverish Ice Cream's Felecia Hatcher, Chef Adrianne Calvo, Misha's Cupcakes creator Misha Kuryla-Gomez, caterer Joy Wallace and cookbook author and radio host Linda Gassenheimer.   The event, emceed by branding goddess Michelle Villalobos, sold out, and the room was buzzing with happy, nervous energy. People sat forward in their seats or texted like their lives depended on it, ready to take on the world, ready to soak up any advice we could offer. We offered this -- you need to have a plan. Winning the lottery or appearing on \"Oprah\" helps position you for success, but you can't, you know, count on it. We mean business plans, financial plans, basic tools you really need to make it. I want to succeed in my business, I want to make money, (buy my book, be my next VegTherapy client, book me on your show), but money and Facebook \"Likes\" aren't the only metrics. They're not the only things worth valuing. Make a business plan, get the website up and running, but align yourself with something beyond your business, too, something that matters to you so much it keeps you going when your server, numbers and spirits are down. Call it a mission statement. My mission statement -- and my mission -- is to create plant-based recipes to delight you now but also get you thinking long after a great meal about the impact of what we eat.  We need to lighten up on the planet that's already feeling our weight. For starters, there's seven billion of us, more of us than ever in the history of mankind. A good chunk of us -- a third, in fact -- are chunky. Dangerously so. We're also heavy in terms of the resources we use to produce our food. Livestock production generates sky-high amounts of greenhouse gases and consumes and pollutes oceans of precious water. It's also heavy on bad karma. Ten billion animals are killed every year in America alone just to feed our outsized appetite for meat. If we eat less meat and more plants, there'll be food enough to feed all of us and land aplenty to grow it. Our challenge now in the food industry -- and out of it -- is realizing we don't live in a vacuum, that our actions, right down to what we eat, have an impact -- politically, environmentally, ethically, on our health and even on our business.  It's good to have a business plan. It's vital. We need a business plan for life on Earth. Right now, we don't have one. We don't even have a plan B. Get out there and show the world what you're made of, but don't forget the world, either. The fattest bank account won't matter in an unsustainable world -- that's the real bottom line. \n(Collard) Greens Rolling in Dough Greens, rolling in dough, all terms for money, which we want to make.  But we also want to make dinner, so I went literal here, with these collard tortillas.  Serve with black beans, guacamole and chopped jalape\u00f1o. 1 fresh bunch of collard greens \n4 tablespoons fresh lime juice\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 pinch chili powder\n4 to 6 soft tortillas, whole wheat, corn or GF   Wash the collards well. Blot dry. Slice out the thick stems and discard (you could use them to make broth later -- I do it all the time). Place the collard leaves on on top of each other and roll them up widthwise, forming a tight collard cigar. Using your sharpest knife, slice across as thinly as possible, forming skinny ribbons -- collard tinsel, or to use the correct culinary term chiffonade. You'll have about 4 cups of greens. Congratulations, you've just done the toughest bit of the recipe. Scoop the collards into a large bowl. Add the lime juice and olive oil and toss to combine. Sprinkle in the cumin and chili powder and toss again. Spread a good spoonful or two of greens (1/3 to 1/2 cup, depending on tortilla size) on each tortilla. Roll up and enjoy. Serves 4 to 6.\n'}.

The SEC also named former Theranos President Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani in its complaint, accusing Holmes and Balwani of raising over $700 million from investors \u201cthrough an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company\u2019s technology, business, and financial performance.\u201d Per the SEC, the settlements are subject to court approval, and neither Theranos nor Holmes has admitted to or denied the allegations against them. The privately held startup had promised to revolutionize the blood testing industry, claiming its proprietary technology could run more than 240 tests on a single drop of blood. Fueled by that claim, and by an early (and\u00a0ultimately doomed) partnership with Walgreens, Theranos hit a\u00a0valuation of around $9 billion\u00a0in 2014.

Wednesday\u2019s SEC complaint asserts that the company\u2019s claims about its technological abilities were misrepresentations at best and outright lies at worst.

UPDATE: March 9 \u2015 Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan announced late Wednesday that the company is reviewing its use of \u201cgreyballing\u201d technology and \u201cexpressly prohibiting its use to target action by local regulators going forward.\u201d Earlier: According to The New York Times, which first reported the story, the company deployed the software in cities that deemed the ride-hailing service illegal or otherwise tried to slow the company\u2019s rapid expansion. The Times reports that\u00a0Uber\u2019s software clues into a number of signs from prospective riders to determine whether they might pose a threat to the company or its drivers, notably in the form of enforcement officers trying to catch Uber operating illegally. This includes the rider\u2019s behavior using the app itself, such as the phone type, and patterns in the frequency of its use. Another clear tell: interacting with the app in close proximity to police stations and other government buildings. In 2014, for instance, officials in Portland, Oregon, sued Uber for operating in the city illegally, and promised to hit every driver caught working for the service with a fine of up to $3,750. The threat accomplished little, as Uber continued operating anyway. Portland officers pushed forward with sting operations in an attempt to catch the unlicensed operators, yet were stymied as drivers repeatedly canceled their rides, as this 2014 video by The Oregonian demonstrates: \u201cThere were two drivers that were available at one point in time, and they both canceled on me,\u201d Portland Code Enforcement Officer Erich England comments in the video, giving a perplexed shrug. \u201cNow there are no drivers available.\u201d Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman acknowledged the city\u2019s relationship with Uber was \u201cpretty tumultuous\u201d in 2014, but he told The Huffington Post that doesn\u2019t excuse the company\u2019s behavior. \u201cI\u2019m appalled that Uber would direct its employees to work on developing software to deliberately thwart the efforts of Portland, and no doubt other cities,\u201d Saltzman told HuffPost. He characterized the city\u2019s regulatory efforts as dedicated to \u201cthe safety and wellbeing of our citizens and our tourists.\u201d Portland and Uber smoothed over their relationship in 2015, but Saltzman said the city would consider levying fines or banning the company (again), should it run afoul of regulations. Uber maintains its software is completely legal, adding that it is used more often to keep its drivers safe than to circumvent sting operations. \u201cThis program denies ride requests to fraudulent users who are violating our terms of service,\u201d an Uber spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement, \u201cwhether that\u2019s people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret \u2018stings\u2019 meant to entrap drivers.\u201d\u200b That logic seemed pretty sound to Robert Weisberg, a Stanford Law professor and the co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, though he said he\u2019d need to know the particulars of how it operates to be certain. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything illegal about it,\u201d Weisberg told HuffPost. He noted prosecutors might have a case for obstruction of justice, but that \u201cusually requires direct interference with the express purpose of preventing police from doing a very specific thing at a very specific time.\u201d \u201cIf you or I were degenerates and up to no good \u2015 or at least thinking about no good \u2015 I could say, \u2018Hey I just saw four cops on this corner, go the other direction\u2019 or something like that,\u201d\u00a0Weisberg added. \u201cThis is just a huge technological enhancement of that capacity.\u201d With a chuckle, he noted, \u201cThere\u2019s great irony here in terms of police surveillance,\u201d given that police departments continually push for an increased ability to track and collect data on private citizens, yet apparently object when the tables are turned. Legal or no, the bombshell revelation certainly won\u2019t quiet criticism that Uber doesn\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer and will bend any rule to get what it wants. That ideology seems to have manifested itself internally at the company, which finds itself embroiled in\u00a0allegations of rampant sexism\u00a0(and numerous high-level\u00a0resignations\u00a0potentially linked to the allegations). Other controversies rocking Uber at the moment include: a lawsuit over claims that\u00a0Uber stole technology from a Google-founded competitor; fallout surrounding a\u00a0video of CEO Travis Kalanick angrily telling off an Uber driver; and a #DeleteUber protest that wiped 200,000 users until\u00a0Kalanick was pressured to resign from President Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisory council.'}.

He was fired when the company claimed the Facebook post violated its anti-harassment policy.\u00a0 The National Labor Relations Board ruled 2-1 that the firing violated labor laws. The three-judge panel of the Second Circuit upheld the decision last week, saying the Facebook post was \u201cvulgar and inappropriate,\u201d but\u00a0\u201cnot so egregious as to exceed the NLRA\u2019s protection.\u201d The key?

Strampel supervised Nassar for almost 15 years during Nassar\u2019s tenure as MSU\u2019s team doctor, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes.\u00a0He\u00a0stepped down as dean in 2017 due to medical reasons\u00a0and amid backlash that he had ignored complaints about Nassar.

However other regulations, like background checks of drivers and insurance requirements for passengers, serve important public purposes. While Uber has preferred the route of simple evasion of regulations, it is likely that we will see a much needed modernization of regulations in this area. While Uber\u2019s impact on the taxi industry is clearly not a joke, the market valuation of the company may well be. Uber is not yet publicly traded, but its market value has been estimated as being as high as $70 billion. That compares to a market value of just $51.0 billion for auto giant GM and $44.6 billion for Ford. These are longstanding companies that both make close to $10 billion in annual profits. By contrast, Uber is losing billions of dollars a year. Investors are not ordinarily prepared to pay large amounts of money for the stock of companies that lose money. The stock certificates might be pretty, but presumably, at the end of the day, investors will want to see profits. There are two stories whereby Uber turns itself around and becomes a hugely profitable company. The first is that it will soon drive out enough of its competition so that it will enjoy near-monopoly status in many markets. This will allow it to raise its prices enough so that it can then turn large profits. There are two problems with this story, one technical and the other legal. The technical problem is that it is not clear whether the technology of the taxi industry lends itself to monopolies. It\u2019s not that hard to have an app for calling cabs, nor is it hard to hire drivers. If Uber were to up its prices by 20-30 percent, it would likely find many new competitors in the market. The other problem is the legal one. Predatory pricing to gain a monopoly is textbook anti-competitive behavior. This should lead to anti-trust action by the government and lawsuits by competitors. This is undoubtedly a major reason that Uber has staffed itself with former top Obama administration officials. Of course, Donald Trump has probably never heard of anti-trust laws. The other turnaround story for Uber is that it was never really about taxis, but rather self-driving vehicles. Uber is going to be the behemoth of the self-driving vehicle industry and dominate this market the way I.B.M. once dominated computers and Microsoft dominated software. The problem with this story is that Uber would have to beat out a large number of major competitors, including the existing auto companies, Apple, Google, and undoubtedly many smaller tech companies. That seems like a long shot. So let\u2019s try alternative number three \u2013 Uber\u2019s stock is nearly worthless, but for now people are willing to pay lots of money for it. This shouldn\u2019t sound far-fetched if you have heard of AOL, Priceline, or more recently Groupon. In each case, stock valuations soared into the tens of billions or even hundreds of billions before plunging to a small fraction of this amount. In such cases, we see a massive redistribution of wealth, often from pension funds and other institutional investors to the \u201cvisionaries\u201d who were able to sucker them. Folks like Steve Case, the former CEO of AOL, are incredibly rich today because of their talents in this area. Perhaps Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is following in his footsteps. But there is another aspect to the ephemeral value of high-flying companies that eventually come down to earth. Uber actually is spending lots of money on research. The same applies to many other low or no profit companies or their major shareholders, such as Telsa and Amazon. Telsa CEO Elon Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, have both committed large amounts of their companies\u2019 and/or their own money to research in areas like solar power, electric cars, and reusable space crafts. It\u2019s not clear at this point whether this is money that is especially well-spent. We only get the information that they choose to make public. However, one clear outgrowth of these huge stock valuations, whether or not they subsequently prove to be justified by future profits, is the funding of large amounts of research in new technologies. In many cases, this is research that we might have envisioned the government financing in prior decades, just as it did for the development of the Internet. Whether or not the research proves very useful remains to be seen. In any case, we have effectively outsourced government-financed research to these newly rich marketers, who are in turn relying on funding from institutional investors, some of whom are also in the public sector. It\u2019s certainly better to have these folks financing research rather than just buying more islands and yachts, but fulfilling the childhood dreams of the newly rich hardly seems like the most efficient mechanism for supporting research. Unfortunately, in Donald Trump\u2019s America, it may be the only one available.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

There,\u00a0circling some 13,000 miles from the icy planetoid, scientists spotted a small moon, nicknamed MK2. The moon's discovery, announced Tuesday by\u00a0Hubble Space Telescope\u00a0scientists, comes more than a decade after astronomers\u00a0first spotted Makemake in 2005.\u00a0 Alex Parker, a planetary astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told National Geographic that when he glimpsed the object during an analysis of Hubble observations back in April 2015, he assumed it wasn't the first time someone had spied the moonlet. Instead, Parker quickly learned he'd discovered a moon 1,300 times fainter than its host dwarf planet.\u00a0\u00a0 As Hubble notes in its announcement, several previous visual sweeps of MK2 showed a lonely mass, one of several dwarf planets located in the Kuiper Belt -- a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. The team of scientists ultimately observed MK2 thanks to Hubble's \"unique ability to see faint objects near bright ones,\" it said. \"It is a very exciting discovery!\" Parker, who led the image analysis for the observations, told The Associated Press.\u00a0\"It means that Makemake is no longer the odd-one-out in the moon-hosting Kuiper Belt dwarf planet club.\" Makemake, named after the god of fertility\u00a0in the Rapa Nui mythology of Easter Island, is 870 miles wide and takes roughly 310 Earth-years to circle the sun. In comparison, the newly discovered moon has a diameter of about 100 miles. Parker said in a statement that the discovery will provide researchers \"an opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail,\" perhaps answering questions about the mass, origin and evolution of the dwarf-planet system.'}.

Well, half of the Patriots did, anyway. Thirty-four Patriots players, plus several staff members and coach Bill Belichick, attended the ceremony on the White House lawn as Trump praised what he called \u201cthe greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time.\u201d The team\u2019s full roster includes 68 players, which means half of the squad skipped the celebration. Super Bowl champion players often miss the annual White House victory visit due to scheduling conflicts. But turnout for Wednesday\u2019s event appeared to be lower than for a previous Patriots visit in 2015. To some players, absences were notably linked to politics. The New York Times first pointed out the stark difference between photographs of the event this year, and those from 2015, the last time the Patriots won the Super Bowl. The earlier photo shows about 120 people, including players and staff, standing behind former President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, there were barely more than 50 people alongside Trump. Patriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j The Patriots strongly refuted a Times tweet showing the 2015 and 2017 photographs, saying the comparisons \u201clack context.\u201d The 2015 photo included more than 40 support staff members, who were seated on the lawn this year, the team said. These photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y \u201dOnly during the Trump presidency does the media care ...\u00a0this much about who doesn\u2019t attend,\u201d\u00a0Patriots spokesman Stacey James told HuffPost. On Thursday, New York Times\u2019 sports editor Jason Stallman apologized for the paper\u2019s tweet, which he called \u201cterrible.\u201d \u201cI wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Stallman said in\u00a0an email to The Washington Post. \u201cIt was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. \u201cOnce we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.\u201d Wednesday was the fifth time the team has gone to the White House, James said, and the number of players attending has ranged from about 27 to 50. \u201cHere\u2019s what gripes me \u2015\u00a0the scrutiny with which the visit to the White House has been handled by the press,\u201d James said. \u201cNever before have we had players being asked, \u2018Are you going to the White House?\u2019 ... There were only a few players who came out who said they don\u2019t support the president and weren\u2019t going for that reason.\u201d Notably absent Wednesday was Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who canceled at the last minute,\u00a0citing \u201cpersonal family matters,\u201d according to a statement obtained by ESPN. Brady also missed the festivities in 2015, but attended the three previous visits. Trump didn\u2019t mention Brady, but he did call out several players by name, including an awkward moment involving wide receiver Danny Amendola, The Boston Globe reported. Amendola was among those who missed the event. \u201cWhere\u2019s Danny? Where\u2019s Danny?\u201d Trump said. Amendola later thanked the president for the \u201cshout out\u201d in a since-deleted tweet, and said he was attending a funeral.\u00a0 Six other Patriots had announced they wouldn\u2019t attend the event for political reasons. The Globe reported this week that Alan Branch would skip the ceremony because of\u00a0Trump\u2019s sexist remarks, and \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to spend time away from my family to shake the hand of a guy I wouldn\u2019t want to meet with or talk to.\u201d Defensive back Devin McCourty told Time in February he would stay away, explaining the \u201cbasic reason for me is I don\u2019t feel accepted in the White House.\u201d Trump has personal ties to the Patriots,\u00a0as various media outlets have reported. Brady had a Make America Great Again hat in his locker for much of the 2016 season, and Trump\u2019s campaign garnered the support of both Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft. Trump responded to the controversy on Thursday with a jab at the Times.\u00a0 Failing @nytimes, which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H. Kraft in February complained about media attention to players\u2019 decisions to skip this year\u2019s celebration, saying it was the first time people cared. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players don\u2019t go,\u201d Kraft told the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s gotten any media attention. You know, some of the players have the privilege of going in college because they\u2019re on national championship teams, others have family commitments. But this is America. We\u2019re all free to do whatever\u2019s best for us. We\u2019re just privileged to be in a position to be going.\u201d Matt Ferner contributed reporting.

The long journey of the radioactive particles could help researchers better understand how the ocean\u2019s currents circulate around the world. Ocean simulations showed that the plume of radioactive cesium-137 released by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 could begin flowing into U.S. coastal waters starting in early 2014 and peak in 2016. Luckily, two ocean currents off the eastern coast of Japan \u2014 the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension \u2014 would have diluted the radioactive material so that its concentration fell well below the World Health Organization\u2019s safety levels within four months of the Fukushima incident. But it could have been a different story if nuclear disaster struck on the other side of Japan. \u201cThe environmental impact could have been worse if the contaminated water would have been released in another oceanic environment in which the circulation was less energetic and turbulent,\u201d said Vincent Rossi, an oceanographer and postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems in Spain. Fukushima\u2019s radioactive water release has taken its time journeying across the Pacific. By comparison, atmospheric radiation from the Fukushima plant began reaching the U.S. West Coast within just days of the disaster back in 2011. [Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know] Tracking radioactivity\u2019s path The radioactive plume has three different sources: radioactive particles falling out from the atmosphere into the ocean, contaminated water directly released from the plant, and water that became contaminated by leaching radioactive particles from tainted soil. The release of cesium-137 from Fukushima in Japan\u2019s more turbulent eastern currents means the radioactive material is diluted to the point of posing little threat to humans by the time it leaves Japan\u2019s coastal waters. Rossi worked with former colleagues at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Australia to simulate the spread of Fukushima\u2019s radioactivity in the oceans \u2014 a study detailed in the October issue of the journal Deep-Sea Research Part 1. Researchers averaged 27 experimental runs of their model \u2014 each run starting in a different year \u2014 to ensure that the simulated spread of the cesium-137 as a \"tracer\" was not unusually affected by initial ocean conditions. Many oceanographers studying the ocean\u2019s currents prefer using cesium-137 to track the ocean currents because it acts as a passive tracer in seawater, meaning it doesn't interact much with other things, and decays slowly with a long half-life of 30 years. \u201cOne advantage of this tracer is its long half-life and our ability to measure it quite accurately, so that it can be used in the future to test our models of ocean circulation and see how well they represent reality over time,\u201d Rossi told LiveScience. \u201cIn 20 years' time, we could go out, grab measurements everywhere in the Pacific and compare them to our model.\u201d Journey across the Pacific Rim The team focused on predicting the path of the radioactivity until it reached the continental shelf waters stretching from the U.S. coastline to about 180 miles (300 kilometers) offshore. About 10 to 30 becquerels (units of radioactivity representing decay per second) per cubic meter of cesium-137 could reach U.S. and Canadian coastal waters north of Oregon between 2014 and 2020. (Such levels are far below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s limits for drinking water.) By comparison, California\u2019s coast may receive just 10 to 20 becquerels per cubic meter from 2016 to 2025. That slower, lesser impact comes from Pacific currents taking part of the radioactive plume down below the ocean surface on a slower journey toward the Californian coast, Rossi explained. A large proportion of the radioactive plume from the initial Fukushima release won't even reach U.S. coastal waters anytime soon. Instead, the majority of the cesium-137 will remain in the North Pacific gyre \u2014 a region of ocean that circulates slowly clockwise and has trapped debris in its center to form the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch\u201d \u2014 and continue to be diluted for approximately a decade following the initial Fukushima release in 2011. (The water from the current power plant leak would be expected to take a similar long-term path to the initial plume released, Rossi said.) But the plume will eventually begin to escape the North Pacific gyre in an even more diluted form. About 25 percent of the radioactivity initially released will travel to the Indian Ocean and South Pacific over two to three decades after the Fukushima disaster, the model showed.

One woman says her boss at the fulfillment center, where workers pack and ship Verizon products, came by to offer her a peppermint, dropped it in her hand, then reached down and grabbed her breast. Another woman\u2019s boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague, according to her complaint. After she reported the incident to the human resources department, her boss treated her more \u201charshly,\u201d and wrote her up for not working \u2015 falsely, she says in the complaint. She quit in January. Filed in two batches at the EEOC in early and late April, the charges show what pervasive, systemic sexual harassment looks like for low-wage workers of color \u2015 the warehouse workers are primarily African American \u2015 who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of Me Too stories, which tend to focus on high-profile men and more elite, typically white, women. While the first batch of charges got some local press attention, the discrimination claims filed in late April have not been previously reported. In this case, the discrimination charges were not filed against Verizon nor do they involve the company\u2019s employees. Instead, workers have filed their claims against their direct employer, XPO Logistics, a multibillion-dollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with Verizon. On Wednesday, ahead of Verizon\u2019s shareholder meeting, the National Women\u2019s Law Center,\u00a0a women\u2019s economic rights nonprofit, and four other groups sent a letter to Verizon CEO and chairman Lowell McAdam, urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the Memphis facility. Other signers include the women\u2019s nonprofit A Better Balance, the Tennessee branch of the NAACP and SisterReach, a women\u2019s rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the South. The president of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents actors, singers and other entertainers, also signed on. \u201cThe XPO warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to Verizon\u2019s stated policies and practices,\u201d says the letter, provided exclusively to HuffPost on Tuesday. The letter notes that McAdam has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s rights. The CEO recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at Makers, a women\u2019s conference run by Verizon-owned Oath. (Oath is also HuffPost\u2019s parent company.) \u201cAs community leaders, and women\u2019s rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the Times Up and MeToo campaigns and movements, we are deeply concerned with how Verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain,\u201d the letter says. The writers ask for a meeting with Verizon to further discuss the situation. HuffPost alerted Verizon to the letter on Tuesday night. The company said this was the first it heard about the situation in Memphis. \u201cWe are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter,\u201d Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni told HuffPost on Wednesday, after looking at the charges.\u00a0 Later that day, lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations, according to a letter sent to XPO from Verizon, broadly outlining their discussion and next steps. \u201cThese are very disturbing and serious allegations,\u201d Verizon\u2019s attorneys write. \u201cVerizon expects XPO Logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it.\u201d Verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor XPOs actions. The updates and investigation will \u201cinform the basis of any decisions Verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with XPO.\u201d The letter was addressed to two XPO executives, including in-house lawyer Richard Valitutto. According to the harassment charges, Valitutto was also employed by the warehouse\u2019s previous owners, New Breed Logistics, when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010. The company lost that case, and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues. It\u2019s not clear what happened after that. A spokesman for XPO declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early April and had not yet seen the late April filings. \u201cOur culture promotes safety and respect. We have no tolerance for any form of harassment,\u201d an XPO spokesman told HuffPost. \u201cWe promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention.\u201d The charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors. It\u2019s a struggle that\u2019s somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry, where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas. Other tech firms, including Facebook, do hold their contractors to various standards \u2015 including minimum wages and benefits requirements. Many, including Verizon, say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with. Those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the Me Too movement matures. It\u2019s possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements, where big-name companies outsource labor needs to U.S. companies with a far lower profile. \u201cPart of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment,\u201d said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which has signed on to the letter. Companies like Verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella, she said. They have a lot of power to make change. \u201cVerizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice,\u201d said Martin, who also oversees some legal work for Time\u2019s Up, the anti-harassment initiative created by women in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement. The women who filed these claims are hourly workers who don\u2019t earn a lot of money, and many are the sole breadwinners for their family, grateful for the hourly work and full-time benefits, despite the hazards of the job, said Gloria Sweet-Love, president of the NAACP in Tennessee, which signed the letter. The racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss, as the female workers at the plant are mainly African American and their supervisors\u2019 mostly white men, according to the letter from the groups. One woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him, calling one his \u201cchocolate baby.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the South got for generations,\u201d said Sweet-Love, who noted she\u2019s met with many workers inside the XPO facility, where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours, desperate to hang on to the full-time work that comes with benefits \u2015 a rarity for low-wage workers in Memphis. \u201cThese eight women are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more. Everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked,\u201d she said. The facility\u2019s previous owner, New Breed Logistics, was sued by the EEOC in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in Memphis. A jury found in favor of the victims, with a $1.5 million judgment. A federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward. However, while the case was on appeal, XPO bought the facility. Verizon contracted with New Breed, as well. According to the lawyer who filed the current crop of charges, XPO continues to employ executives who were there when the last suit was filed, including its human resources director and corporate counsel Valitutto.\u00a0 This article has been updated with details of Verizon\u2019s letter to XPO.\u00a0 Have you experienced sexual harassment or discrimination where you work?

The move comes just weeks before the president is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and days after the two Koreas held a summit at the Demilitarized Zone, where they laid the foundation for a formal end to the Korean War and discussed ways to denuclearize the peninsula. The Times, citing unnamed sources briefed on the order, said Trump has been determined to reduce the number of troops in South Korea, citing the cost and the fact that their presence has done little to quash North Korea\u2019s antagonistic nuclear weapon program. It\u2019s unclear if Trump would push for a full or partial reduction in troop numbers, but a full reduction is unlikely. The U.S. currently has 28,500 troops stationed in the country, and South Korea, a longtime ally,\u00a0pays nearly $890 million a year in expenses, or about half the total cost. That deal expires at the end of this year, and Trump hopes to convince Seoul to foot more of the bill. South Korea on Friday denied the Times\u2019 report, saying a \u201ckey\u201d official of the U.S. National Security Council told the country\u2019s national security chief, Chung Eui-yong, that the news was false, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. The White House\u00a0on Friday\u00a0issued a statement from National Security Adviser John Bolton calling the report \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d Earlier this week, South Korea said that, regardless of the outcome of peace negotiations with the North, the country wanted U.S. troops to remain in the country. The comment came after a prominent adviser to President Moon Jae-in wrote that it would be \u201cdifficult to justify\u201d the presence of U.S. forces were the conflict with Kim to end. \u201cU.S. troops stationed in South Korea are an issue regarding the alliance between South Korea and the United States,\u201d Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for Seoul\u2019s Blue House, said in a statement responding to the adviser, Moon Chung-in. \u201cIt has nothing to do with signing peace treaties.\u201d North Korean analysts questioned the validity of Trump\u2019s order shortly after the Times report. Experts have long said the presence of U.S. soldiers and civilians so close to North Korea has long served as a deterrent to a physical conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s not the nuclear umbrella that keeps [the Republic of Korea] safe. It\u2019s the 30,000 American soldiers and their families living there that do,\u201d Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt is literally the blood oath of the American people to South Korea. They value the alliance so much, that they put their lives (and their family\u2019s lives) on the line.\u201d Kim Jong Un is going to lead Trump right where Trump\u2019s instinct wants to go. We may literally get a deal of some sorts if troops and extended deterrence to South Korea are on the table. And it\u2019s not \u201ca concession\u201d for Trump...he wants to go there anyway. https://t.co/qZDaiQzeHV I cannot imagine a worse approach heading into the summit.  https://t.co/zgekxUIZbl Kim has long demanded the U.S. place its troop presence on the negotiating table as part of any discussions to give up its nuclear weapons, but officials have long rejected such calls. However, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis appeared to say the issue might be open to discussion. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the issues that we\u2019ll be discussing in negotiations with our allies first, and of course with North Korea,\u201d\u00a0Mattis\u00a0said last week. \u201cFor right now, we just have to go along with process, have the negotiations and not try to make preconditions or presumptions about how it\u2019s going to go.\u201d This article has been updated to include Friday\u2019s White House statement.'}.

Dubbed Dragonfly 44, the collection of stars lies about 330 million light-years from Earth in a group of galaxies known as the Coma cluster. It\u2019s about the size of our own Milky Way galaxy but much, much fainter. It contains only about 1 billion stars, which is roughly 1 percent the number of stars in our galaxy.\u00a0 And 99.99 percent of the mass in what some are calling \u201cthe Milky Way\u2019s dark twin\u201d\u00a0is in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance that is believed to make up 85 percent of everything in the universe.\u00a0Dark matter can be \u201cseen\u201d\u00a0in the way if affects the movement of stars within galaxies but it has never been directly observed \u2015\u00a0at least, not with any certainty.

Theory holds that dark matter particles annihilate each other and emit gamma radiation whenever they collide, van Dokkum said. Scientists have been searching for this distinctive signal in dwarf dark galaxies, he added, but the signal would be much stronger in a big dark matter galaxy like Dragonfly 44. \u201cThe race is on to find massive dark galaxies are even closer to us than Dragonfly 44, so we can look for feeble signals that may reveal a dark matter particle,\u201d he said in the news release.\u00a0 Stay tuned!'}.

The technology company made the argument in a brief filed in federal court in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on Friday, a week after the U.S. Department of Justice said it would push forward with its appeal of a federal magistrate's ruling saying he could not force the company to assist authorities. The government's decision to continue appealing the February ruling at a higher level, to U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie, came after an outside party provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation a way to access the phone in the San Bernardino case without Apple's help. In its brief, Apple argued the government had not said if it had tried to use the secret method from the San Bernardino case on the iPhone in the drug case, nor if authorities had consulted with the unnamed third party or anyone else about it. Apple, which reiterated many of its other legal arguments in the case, said the government \"has utterly failed to satisfy its burden to demonstrate that Apple\u2019s assistance in this case is necessary.\" The Justice Department, in a statement, noted that some 70 times before the Brooklyn case emerged, Apple had helped authorities access data on iPhones. \"Indeed, Apple has said it would take them only a few hours to open this kind of phone, because they already have a mechanism that would allow them to do so,\" the Justice Department said. Prosecutors are challenging a Feb. 29 ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein holding he did not have the authority to order Apple to disable the security of an iPhone seized in a drug probe. That case has taken a higher profile after prosecutors dropped their effort to get Apple's help accessing the phone of Rizwan Farook, one of the two killers in the San Bernardino massacre, which left 14 people dead and 22 wounded, after a third party provided the FBI a method to crack it. FBI Director James Comey said last week that the method used on the San Bernardino iPhone 5c would not work on other models, including the iPhone 5s, the type in the Brooklyn case. That phone belonged to Jun Feng, who has pleaded guilty to participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy, which prosecutors are continuing to investigate. Unlike the phone used in San Bernardino, Feng's phone had an older operating system, iOS 7, which is not protected under the same encryption technology, which is why Apple could access it.

Hogan Gidley, the deputy White House press secretary, told Fox later on Wednesday that he had \u201cno idea of the topics of the show\u201d before Giuliani\u2019s interview, but then directed all questions to Trump\u2019s outside lawyers.

Trump has moved to\u00a0distance himself\u00a0from the attorney, saying last week Cohen only handled a \u201ctiny, tiny little fraction\u201d of his legal work. During Wednesday\u2019s interview, Giuliani said Trump paid Cohen a retainer of $35,000 \u201cwhen he was doing no work for the president\u201d and claimed the fund was used for reimbursements. Giuliani\u00a0later clarified to The New York Times that the payments to the retainer were made monthly from Trump\u2019s personal family account and that Cohen was paid between $460,000 and $470,000 in total, including money for \u201cincidental expenses.\u201d When Hannity asked if Trump knew about the details of the payments, Giuliani backtracked slightly, saying that the president \u201cdidn\u2019t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know.\u201d \u201cBut he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this. I take care of things like this for my clients,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI don\u2019t burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people.\u201d Late Wednesday,\u00a0Fox News\u2019 John Roberts said Giuliani backtracked even further and claimed that the president didn\u2019t know what the money was for, but was simply told by Cohen to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnamed \u201cexpenses.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s revelation appeared to take Hannity aback, and just moments after the host went off the air, Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham questioned the bombshell. \u201cI love Rudy, but they better have an explanation for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d In March, Cohen confirmed that he\u2019d made a payment to Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with Trump,\u00a0out of his own pocket. \u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen told The New York Times in a statement at the time. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s statements Wednesday also appear to contradict that claim. Still, shortly after the interview, Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal that Trump\u2019s earlier comments were \u201cnot [an] issue.\u201d \u201cCohen was his lawyer and had discretion to settle, as I have had for clients ultimately paying for it,\u201d he told the outlet, before noting that Trump was \u201cprobably not aware\u201d of the payment. \u201cI know the public may think the settlement may mean an admission of guilt, but it\u2019s not,\u201d\u00a0Giuliani told the Washington Post.\u00a0 \u201cPeople settle things all the time just to get rid of harassment. The amount of money tells me this was a harassment settlement.\u201d But Daniels\u2019 lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said \u201cevery American, regardless of their politics, should be outraged\u201d by the news. \u201cMr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen.

Second-quarter earnings saw services emerge as Apple's second-largest business after the iPhone for the first time, topping iPad and Mac sales, which both fell. The App Store, Apple Music, storage center iCloud and mobile wallet Apple Pay and other services generated nearly $6 billion in revenue, up 20 percent from the previous year. And executives have cheered the progress they are making in subscriptions, touting Apple Music's 13 million paying subscribers. The size of Apple's installed base with 1 billion devices in consumer hands suggests it has plenty of room to grow in services. Services also promise a recurring revenue stream, unlike hardware sales. But analysts say Apple faces an uphill battle in carving out the same sort of position in services that it has achieved with its hardware. The $6 billion in services revenue also pales in comparison to iPhone sales which accounted for about two-thirds of the company's $50.6 billion quarterly sales. Firms such as music service Spotify, cloud storage rivals Google and Microsoft Corp and map makers have claimed major audiences among iPhone users, even when Apple has offered its own products as a default. Also raising the stakes for its services business has been Apple's decision to release in March the smaller, much cheaper iPhone SE - a move that is seen as trading revenue per device for broader adoption of its phones. \"For the strategy to really make a lot of sense, you want to be more aggressive in building that services revenue,\" said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. Apple may also have to speed up its game. \"Apple has settled into this annual upgrade cycle for hardware and software,\" said analyst Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research. \"That's quite different than the way that say Facebook pushes out updates to its app or Google makes changes to its search engine - they do that almost in real time.\" Gillis at BGC Partners calculates that margins for Apple's services businesses are not as strong as the iPhone. \"I don't think any one is ever going to find that kind of sweet spot,\" he said. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on Tuesday services achieve a similar level of profitability for the company as the average of its other businesses. Pushing ahead in services in China - Apple's second largest market - may also be challenging due to regulatory concerns. Chinese regulators have demanded that Apple halt its sales of books and movies in the country, the New York Times reported last week. \"They need (services) in China - it has to be part of the growth story,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.

As the world speeds up, however, we must preserve at least some of our old-fashioned study skills.    Reading, for instance, is changing and we cannot hold back the tide. But the essence of literacy must be preserved - at least until we can lay a foundation for an equally profound replacement.  The same applies to cultural and artistic literacy.  We adults cannot predetermine what the attention spans of subsequent generations will be.  Nor should we try.  We should take our stand by umpiring a structured discussion on the principles that we seek to preserve.  It is not up to teachers to preordain which of our favored values survive, but we must protect the integrity of the schooling process.  Finally, \"Pay close attention; I'm only going to show you once,\" must not be seen as an artifact of a teacher-centered world that is obsolete in a world made \"flat\" by technology.

Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any \u201cbackdoors\u201d that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems. But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products\u2019 source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said. While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia\u2019s huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported. Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government. U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products\u2019 source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions. From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT) The demands are being made by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia. The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews. A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. Moscow\u2019s source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents. In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany\u2019s SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies\u2019 interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records. Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking. Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S.\u00a0tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales. \u201cSome companies do refuse,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers look at the potential market and take the risk.\u201d If tech firms do decline the FSB\u2019s source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC). Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia\u2019s motives for the expanded reviews. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have a real concern about,\u201d said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year. \u201cYou have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that\u2019s obviously a real problem.\u201d However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process. Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say. The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as \u201cclean rooms.\u201d Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites. Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products. Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred. \u00a0 Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia\u2019s military and law enforcement authorities. Echelon\u2019s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense for \u201cprotection of state secrets.\u201d The company\u2019s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the \u201cHead of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.\u201d In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon\u2019s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said. But for Symantec, the lab \u201cdidn\u2019t meet our bar\u201d for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch. \u201cIn the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,\u201d said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products. In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing. \u201cIt poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,\u201d she said. Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia. \u201cAs a result, we do minimal business there,\u201d she said. Markov declined to comment on Symantec\u2019s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency\u2019s records. A company spokesman declined to comment. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities \u201cwhere strict procedures are followed.\u201d FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM\u2019s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted \u00a0at \u201ccertified testing labs\u201d at company-owned premises in the United States. SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers \u201ctheir SAP software investments are safe and secure.\u201d Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company\u2019s interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in \u201ctrusted\u201d independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products. Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

In a series of surveys published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers asked people what they believe a driverless car ought to do in the following scenario: A group of pedestrians are crossing the street, and the only way the car can avoid hitting them is by swerving off the road, which would kill the passengers inside. The participants generally agreed that the cars should be programmed to sacrifice their passengers if doing so would save many other people.  This, broadly speaking, is a utilitarian kind of answer -- one aimed at preserving the greatest possible number of lives.\u00a0But there's one problem: The people in the survey also said they wouldn't want to ride in these cars themselves. It would be OK for others to buy them, the participants said, but they personally would not. \u201cFiguring out how to build ethical autonomous machines is one of the thorniest challenges in artificial intelligence today,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonnefon, of France's Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, and his colleagues wrote in the study. The scenario described above is hypothetical,\u00a0but it and others like it are bound to happen in real life once driverless cars become a mainstream reality, the researchers said. We need answers and rules now, so that we can include them in the programming of these machines. Even if a driverless car has a manual override option, it's easy to imagine a situation where there simply isn't time for a passenger to react and take control of the vehicle. It can be unnerving to think about this stuff. But autonomous vehicles actually have the potential to create a safer world. In the United States alone, about 35,000 traffic deaths occur\u00a0every\u00a0year, along with millions of injuries.\u00a0 \u201cAround 90 percent of those accidents are due to human error,\" Azim Shariff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, and a co-author of the study, said at a press conference. \"Autonomous vehicles promise to change all that for the better, but there are barriers to their wide adoption. A number of those are technological barriers, but they\u2019re also psychological ones.\" If you've ever taken an ethics class, you might recognize the driverless-car scenario described above. It shares a lot of DNA with a famous thought experiment known as the trolley problem. In that scenario, you are the engineer of a runaway trolley. On the track ahead of you,\u00a0five workers are working, oblivious to your approach. You can't brake, but you can switch the trolley onto another track. But there's one person on that track. Would you kill that one worker to save five others? There are a number of variations on the question. What if that one person is pregnant? What if the five others are criminals? You can imagine how many different ways this can go. For the study published Thursday, the researchers\u00a0conducted six online surveys of U.S. residents between June and November 2015, asking participants how they would want their autonomous cars to behave in various scenarios. The researchers tweaked some variables, such as the number of pedestrians or passengers, in each scenario. In some examples, participants had to imagine their child was riding in the car. In others, they were told to imagine riding with their coworkers.  People generally preferred decisions that minimized the number of casualties. In one scenario, 76 percent of respondents said it would be more moral for an autonomous vehicle to sacrifice one passenger if it would save 10 pedestrians. But this allegiance to the greater good only went so far. People balked when asked if they would purchase these cars themselves. \u201cYou can recognize the feeling,\" Bonnefon said -- it's \"the feeling that I want other people to do something, but it would be great not to do it myself.\" What should the manufacturers of driverless cars do? And what would happen to public safety if every driverless car was programmed to protect its passengers above all else? \"To maximize safety, people want to live in a world in which everybody owns driverless cars that minimize casualties, but they want their own car to protect them at all costs,\" said Iyad Rahwan, a researcher at MIT and co-author of the study. Automakers that offer such cars would probably make a lot of money, Rahwan said. But it's the tragedy of the commons: \"If everybody thinks this way then we will end up in a world in which every car will look after its own passenger\u2019s safety and society as a whole is worse off.\" However,\u00a0the researchers believe that public attitudes may change over time. If the technology of autonomous cars improves to the point where riding in them is ultimately safer than driving yourself, people might become more receptive to the idea of buying a car that increases their safety -- even if it's explicitly programmed to allow them to die in certain unlikely situations. If you have opinions of your own, you can contribute to the discussion at this website\u00a0created by the researchers.'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

My kids, Rory and Michaela, are now teenagers.  They love soccer, the ocean and winter sports.   Both have also suffered from asthma, which is made worse by smog pollution. This Father's Day, when I unwrap the \"World's #1 Dad\" coffee cup (fingers crossed), I'll want to know I earned it. And as a dad, my number one priority is to protect my kids from anything that could harm them. But even as #1 dad, some things are out of my control -- that's why, dad to dad, I'm asking President Obama to do everything within his power to prevent the carbon pollution that is altering our climate. He can start with limiting pollution from coal-fired power plants and rejecting projects like the Keystone tar sands pipeline that will increase global warming emissions.   In recent years, we've seen record temperatures, stronger, more frequent storms like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Irene on the East Coast, devastating drought in the Midwest and raging wildfires in the West, as well as historic flooding from Vermont to Iowa. It scares me that this is the world my son and daughter will inherit.  On Monday, the International Energy Agency announced that carbon emissions went up by 1.4 percent worldwide last year, which could mean catastrophic temperature increases if we don't act now. I've been doing this work for decades, so I've long worried about the consequences for my kids of pumping unlimited amounts of heat-trapping gasses into our atmosphere. This news makes me cringe -- it could still get so much worse.  Already, ocean acidity is causing coral bleaching, affecting complex ecosystems; hurricanes like Sandy are destroying miles of coastline; and reduced snow cover on their favorite slopes have me wondering if my kids will be able to enjoy skiing with their own kids.   I worry about their health on a daily basis, but especially on hotter days when more smog stays in the atmosphere. On these \"bad air\" days, there's a greater chance Rory or Michaela will suffer an asthma attack -- especially if they're pushing themselves extra hard during a make-it-or-break-it soccer match.  And I'm not the only one who's worried.  Not surprisingly, recent polls conducted by the Associated Press and Yale University found that 80 percent of Americans now deem global warming a \"serious problem\" and 70 percent of Americans believe that global warming needs to become a priority on the political agenda. And here's the simple truth: Power plants are the single-largest contributor of carbon emissions in the U.S., but there's no limit to the amount of the global warming pollution they can spew. So last summer, I celebrated after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed limiting carbon pollution from power plants for the first time, and then celebrated some more when the public took overwhelming action to curb global warming -- 3.2 million Americans submitted comments to the administration in support of a carbon standard for power plants.  We've heard President Obama speak of the obligation we hold to future generations, to address the causes of climate change, and we know that as a dad, he was thinking of his own children as well.   I ask President Obama to implement the carbon standards for new and existing power plants. If we are to have any chance of averting global warming's worst impacts, we have to limit the largest sources of the carbon pollution fueling the problem. At the same time, I urge him not to make things worse by approving the Keystone tar sands oil pipeline.   As dads, we want to protect our kids from everything. President Obama has the chance to help protect all of our kids right now. He can take this crucial step and forever be remembered as the dad, and the president, who put us on the track to stopping global warming. I hope he delivers.'}.

The $69 billion deal will be this year\u2019s largest corporate acquisition. It will combine one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose far-reaching business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans nationwide. According to the agreed terms, Aetna shareholders stand to receive $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share, the sources said. The companies will announce the deal later on Sunday, the four sources added. Aetna shareholders will own about 22 percent of the combined company, while CVS shareholders will own the remainder, the sources said. Three Aetna directors, including Aetna\u2019s Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini, will join CVS\u2019s board of directors, the sources added. The sources requested not to be identified because the deal has not yet been announced. CVS and Aetna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deal comes as healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to factors including the Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. CVS plans to use its low-cost clinics to eventually save more than $1 billion per year on health care costs for Aetna\u2019s roughly 23 million medical members, sources have said. A combined insurer and PBM will also likely be better placed to negotiate lower drug prices, and the arrangement could boost sales for CVS\u2019s front-of-store retail business. The company expects to invest billions of dollars in the coming years to add clinics and services, largely financed by diverting funds away from other planned investments. That could eventually cut costs substantially, with the clinics serving as an alternative to more expensive hospital emergency room visits. Meanwhile, deeper collaboration between Aetna\u2019s insurance business and CVS\u2019s PBM division could drive down drug costs by adding clients and boosting the PBM\u2019s leverage with drugmakers. Independent PBMs have long been criticized for potential conflicts of interest with insurance company clients, because they could potentially keep cost savings from drug negotiations rather than passing them on to patients. Aetna patient visits to CVS stores for health care and prescriptions could also boost front-of-store sales, which like those at many retailers have fallen in recent quarters amid competition from online sellers. Health insurers meanwhile have sought to cut costs amid steep prescription drug price rises and requirements to care for even the sickest patients under the Affordable Care Act. Aetna last year tried to buy rival Humana Inc to gain leverage to control costs, but U.S. antitrust regulators shot down that transaction and a proposed merger between Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp. Analysts have said the CVS-Aetna deal could prompt other healthcare sector mega-mergers, as rivals scramble to emulate the strategy. It could spur a merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Humana Inc, or between Humana and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners, said recently. \u00a0 VERTICAL MERGER Although CVS and Aetna\u2019s planned merger does not directly consolidate the health insurance or pharmaceutical industries, the U.S. Department of Justice has been taking a closer look at so-called vertical mergers, where the companies are not direct competitors. Last month, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T Inc\u2019s planned $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc, saying the integration of a content producer with a distributor could reduce consumer choice. The CVS-Aetna deal could attract similar scrutiny if regulators feared it could block Aetna customers from frequenting other pharmacies or contracting with other PBMs, several investors said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to talk to the press. But four antitrust experts said there is little doubt the deal will be approved, although it might need to meet conditions to convince antitrust enforcers to sign off. It is unclear whether it would be evaluated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department but that decision might be made based on which agency is less busy, said Matthew Cantor of law firm Constantine Cannon. \u2033(The companies) want the FTC to get it. The reason that the FTC is better at this point is that the Justice Department has just broken with decades of precedent of how to deal with vertical mergers,\u201d said Cantor, referring to the decision to refuse conduct remedies and file a lawsuit to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner. \u00a0 (Reporting by Carl O\u2019Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Caroline Humer in New York and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Lisa Shumaker)'}.

The payments were first reported by porn actress Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney Michael Avenatti, who said Tuesday that his legal firm had uncovered the transactions. The New York Times later reported on the payments based on interviews and an internal review of financial records.\u00a0The Daily Beast also said it could confirm Avenatti\u2019s claims, citing an anonymous source. CNN later reported that special counsel Robert Mueller questioned Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian reportedly behind the payments, about the sums his company\u2019s U.S. affiliate paid to Cohen. As the Times reported last week, Mueller spoke to Vekselberg as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In a tweet, Avenatti said that money from Columbus Nova, the Vekselberg-tied firm, \u201cmay have reimbursed\u201d a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels as hush money to keep her from discussing her alleged 2006 affair with Trump. According to a seven-page summary of Avenatti\u2019s firm\u2019s claims, the payments were sent \u201cwithin approximately 75 days\u201d of the payment to Daniels (aka Stephanie Clifford). Avenatti\u2019s documents did not provide any sources as to how he obtained that information, but he told MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell on Tuesday night that he had obtained the information after working \u201cdiligently for many, many months.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of tools in our toolbox that we use in connection with our cases,\u201d Avenatti said.\u00a0 .@MichaelAvenatti tells @Lawrence: This thing\u2019s ugly and it\u2019s gonna get worse for the president and for Michael Cohen. #LastWord pic.twitter.com/Xh88IdgDv2 The attorney challenged Cohen to release bank statements related to the payments and accused Cohen\u2019s attorneys of trying to \u201chide information from the American people.\u201d \u201cThis thing is a pig.

People lie, documents don\u2019t. Period.\u201d Avenatti also asked where money that went into Cohen\u2019s consulting firm went, saying in his appearance on MSNBC that he was unsure it would have gone solely to Cohen. He did not specify who else might have been paid. \u201cWe believe that that is really the issue at this point, it\u2019s where did the money go,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe American people are really smart. This thing stinks.\u201d Columbus Nova on Tuesday confirmed to The Guardian that it hired Cohen \u201cas a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate,\u201d but denied that Vekselberg had anything to do with payments made to the lawyer\u2019s company. Avenatti\u2019s report also said that Cohen\u2019s company Essential Consulting received payments from AT&T, Novartis and Korea Aerospace Industries LTD in 2017 and 2018. In a statement to HuffPost, AT&T confirmed that it made four payments totaling roughly $200,000 to Essential. \u201cEssential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,\u201d AT&T said in a statement. Novartis confirmed in a Wednesday\u00a0statement to CNBC\u00a0that it made payments to Essential Consulting in accordance with a one-year contract that began in February 2017. The company paid out a total of $1.2 million, it said, not $400,000 as Avenatti reported.\u00a0 The spending was also for nought: Novartis said that a March 2017 meeting with Cohen revealed he and Essential Consulting \u201cwould be unable to provide the services Novartis had anticipated related to US healthcare policy matter and the decision was taken not to engage further.\u201d\u00a0 An attorney for Cohen, Steve Ryan, told Atlantic reporter Natasha Bertrand that he wouldn\u2019t discuss Avenatti\u2019s claims.\u00a0 Cohen acknowledged in February that he paid Daniels the $130,000 sum in October 2016, but said Trump had no knowledge of it. Yet Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who recently joined the White House legal team, countered that claim in a Fox News interview earlier this month when he said Trump repaid Cohen.\u00a0 Giuliani sparked more confusion over what he knows in subsequent interviews, saying he is \u201cnot an expert on the facts.\u201d After significant investigation, we have discovered that Mr. Trump\u2019s atty Mr. Cohen received approximately $500,000 in the mos. after the election from a company controlled by a Russian Oligarc with close ties to Mr. Putin. These monies may have reimbursed the $130k payment. Trump has continued to deny knowledge of the payment and has said the affair never happened.\u00a0 Vekselberg, an energy and financial tycoon, is reportedly close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was among the 38 Russian oligarchs, government officials and businesses targeted with a new round of sanctions\u00a0by the Trump administration in early April.

Sabeen is Syrian. Last year she and her children fled Damascus, and now they live in northern Jordan in a one-room flat. Mattresses without sheets were tilted up against one wall. \"Sometimes I can hardly breathe,\" she said. \"There is no space.\" And there is no water. \"Syrians renting apartments from Jordanian landlords don't get access to the building's water supply,\" Sabeen said. \"The taps don't work in our apartment. We have to buy water from private wells. It isn't right. But we're desperate, so what else can we do?\" Like many Syrian refugees fleeing the civil war in their country, Sabeen has found another crisis in Jordan: water scarcity.  Already one of the world's driest countries, Jordan's lack of water has been badly exacerbated by the added pressures of 600,000 refugees -- the vast majority of whom are not in camps, but in Jordanian cities and towns. Half of these urban refugees don't have the luxury of running water.  And when there is no water, hygiene standards plummet. Bathing is infrequent and infections are on the rise. According to a UN assessment released in January, a third of refugee households don't have access to soap. Simultaneously, water quality has dropped, leading to a rise in diarrheal diseases among young children. This is part of a world-wide epidemic: nearly 20 percent of the deaths of children under five results from water-related diseases. But in Jordan, these problems are not the refugees' alone. As detailed in a new report by Mercy Corps, refugees have put immense pressure on Jordanian resources and infrastructure. Mafraq City in northern Jordan is emblematic. Once home to 70,000 people, the city is now packed with 160,000, thanks to an additional 90,000 refugees who have moved there since the war began. Old neighborhoods are overrun. Multiple Syrian families squeeze into single-family flats. Shops have been converted to makeshift homes, and some families rent rooftops and chicken coops. Children peek out from windows and doorways covered by cardboard and dirty sheets.  Water deficits in Mafraq City have quadrupled. Hospitals don't have adequate supplies, schools are dry, and mosques cannot perform daily ablutions.  \"Water scarcity doesn't know Syrian or Jordanian,\" said Um Omar, a Jordanian woman. \"It affects us all.\" A potential health crisis looms. It is evident in the region's schools, where the influx of Syrian children has doubled the number of students using strictly rationed water supplies. Health and sanitation standards are imperiled. Without water, students cannot drink, flush toilets, or wash hands. To buy more water, some school administrators have responded by raiding their budgets earmarked for critical supplies -- like paper. \"If you think a school without paper is bad,\" said one, \"try a school without water.\" International aid organizations such as Mercy Corps have for years sought ways to leverage limited resources through innovative programming; we are also finding opportunities for collaboration with the private sector. Since 2008, we have partnered with leading water technology company, Xylem, to solve the challenges of the water scarcity epidemic. For example, through a recent grant from the Xylem Emergency Response Fund, and with the help of their corporate citizenship and social investment program Xylem Watermark, we have been able to improve water infrastructure in northern Jordan through the construction of two new wells.  These new water access points have increased the water supply in the vicinity of Mafraq City and within the Zaatari refugee camp, itself home to up to 120,000 refugees. At full capacity, the two wells can provide enough water to meet the daily needs of approximately 88,000 Syrian refugees -- about 73 percent of the camp's population. The success of our investment with Xylem has led to the influx of additional support from UNICEF, adding momentum to our work in the region. In Jordan and elsewhere, the fruits of this cross-sector collaboration have resulted in advanced filtration systems, water-saving network improvements, improved sanitation tools, and better outcomes for those in need. Sadly, those in need are numerous. Half of the world's hospital beds are filled with people suffering from water-related diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 3.4 million people die each year from water, sanitation, and hygiene-related causes. That is roughly the population of Los Angeles. Today is World Water Day, and there is cause to celebrate the progress we have made around the world in alleviating thirst and illness. But we should not lose sight of how far we have to go. Water scarcity continues to touch millions of lives and is a daily source of hardship and death. Moving forward, we must creatively leverage partnerships and resources in ways that save and improve lives in the world's toughest places. '}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

Literally', body='Hawaii smells like blooming eucalyptus and fresh salt air, right?   Unfortunately, not always.  Earlier this week, Hanauma Bay -- a popular Oahu tourist attraction and Obama family favorite -- was closed to the public because of backed up sewer pipes. The Bay draws thousands of tourists a day as a world-famous snorkeling destination, but the site was closed on Thursday for \"emergency maintenance.\" Apparently wastewater backup shut down the facility's restrooms and forced the beach's closure for about 90 minutes. Over on the other side of Honolulu, the residents of Kakaako felt Hanauma Bay's pain. As an up and coming neighborhood, Kakaako is undergoing serious growing pains -- mostly in the olfactory system.  In response to numerous complaints and questions surrounding Kakaako's stench, the Honolulu City Council was recently forced to report about its causes and potential solutions. Pressure in the sewers, they concluded, was to blame, and they promised that remedies like new devices in manholes would alleviate the odor.  But with as many as 30 new buildings being planned in the neighborhood, including several luxury high-rises, many in Honolulu worry that the existing sewer system just isn't up to the task.  \"I thought about moving because of the smells,\" Deborah Whisnand, a Kakaako resident told Hawaii News Now back in September.  \"You can tell it's sewage smell,\" Regina Torres told KHON2. \"It's very strong, it's hard to breathe at times. If you don't have AC in your car and you're driving by, it'll just hit you.\" Honolulu is one of the only major metropolitan areas in the country that does not have a secondary sewage treatment. The city's current system filters the solids and then discharges the wastewater a few miles out in the ocean. But when the wastewater gets backed up, like at Hanauma Bay, or undergoes pressure in the pipes, like in Kakaako, the effects are immediately noticeable. On more than one occasion, the city has been forced to divert wastewater into the Ala Wai canal, which runs through the famous Waikiki, to divert pressure in the system.  In compliance with a 2010 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Honolulu is in the process of installing major overhauls to Oahu's sewage system and the city's mayor promises that they're even ahead of schedule. But the schedule gives the city until 2035 to complete all of the E.P.A.'s requirements, which begs the question: will paradise stink until then?'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.

The global aviation sector, mainly made up of commercial passenger airlines, is responsible for a whopping six-percent of all industrial climate emissions. If the aviation sector were a country, they would be the seventh largest climate polluter in the world.  While other major polluters, like the U.S. coal industry, are facing imminent regulation of their carbon emissions, the question of how to deal with airplanes polluting as they fly around the world remains elusive. It is tricky when you think about it: if an airline owned by a U.S. company, where there is no carbon tax, flies over a country like Germany where there is a carbon tax, should that U.S. airline be charged a carbon tax by Germany? The issue is so tricky that the UN agency ICAO (the International Civil Aviation Organization), which was given responsibility fifteen years ago to come up with a plan for reducing carbon emissions from the aviation sector, has yet to develop an agreeable solution.  Of course, it doesn't help that some airlines, namely major US carriers like United Airlines, have been throwing big lobbying dollars around that have effectively delayed any major action so far.  In late September, ICAO is expected to once again make a recommendation on how to regulate emissions from the aviation sector at a major summit in Montreal, Canada. Rumor is that ICAO will likely punt off a decision once again, to be made at some much later date.  While major issues around energy and climate change, like the Keystone XL pipeline and Canada's tar sands, are regularly and justifiably in the headlines, this sleeper issue of global airplane emissions continues to fly low. It is a complicated piece of international policy that will likely start to gain attention as other sectors begin to deal with, and take responsibility for, their contributions to global climate change.'}.

The ACLU of Illinois said the law, signed on Friday, is \u201cas far-reaching and comprehensive as anywhere in the county.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense of awareness in the legislature that these privacy issues are really important,\u201d said Ed Yohnka, spokesman for the ACLU of Illinois.\u00a0 The new Citizen Privacy Protection Act requires law enforcement in most cases to obtain a warrant before using StingRay, a device capable of extracting information like location, contact lists, text messages and incoming and outgoing call data. Law enforcement must tell the court who they\u2019re looking for and how they plan to tailor the technology so that it doesn\u2019t target unintended citizens.\u00a0 \u201cOne of the things we now know is that if a StingRay is used at an event publicly because of one person, police are required to delete information about everyone else who was there,\u201d Yohnka said. Privacy advocates complain that the StingRay and similar devices capture data from all cell phones in its range, not simply the intended target. The Illinois law will require police to delete this extraneous user data at least every 24 hours.\u00a0 Police say the technology is valuable because it can help pinpoint the location of a kidnapper or fugutive, for example.\u00a0 \u201cIf police are tracking a particular suspect and they think they\u2019re inside of a certain home or apartment, they can track them pretty closely.\u201d Yohnka said.\u00a0 Privacy advocates, however, liken the technology to an unlawful digital \u201cstop and frisk.\u201d Chicago demonstrators have accused police of using the technology to spy on their protest activities and say they fear officials will use the data to build a database of protesters.\u00a0 Devices like StingRay and a competitor called Triggerfish are known as cell tower site simulators, or \u201cInternational Mobile Subscriber Identity catchers.\u201d They\u2019re about the size of a suitcase, so they can be concealed in a police vehicle, aircraft or carried by an individual. When a StingRay is activated, it mimics a cell tower by broadcasting a strong signal that tricks nearby cell phones into connecting to the surveillance device and releasing location data.\u00a0Once the StingRay drops the cell phone signal, the phone reconnects with a legitimate cell tower.\u00a0 Phone users may notice when a cell tower site simulator is nearby. Typical signs are rapid battery drain, difficulty sending or receiving text messages and calls, difficulty connecting to the internet, and sometimes a phone shutting down. \u00a0 The surveillance technology was originally designed for the military and is widely used by federal investigative agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service. The ACLU says police in at least 24 states and the District of Columbia also have cell tower site simulators. \u201cOnce the manufacturers has exhausted their opportunities to sell it to the federal government, they\u2019ve started selling it to local governments,\u201d said Matt Topic, a Chicago civil rights attorney. Topic represents Freddy Martinez, a Chicago-area tech expert who is suing the Chicago Police Department for its refusal to comply with open records requests concerning the use of StingRay.\u00a0 The department, like many others, has been reluctant to admit it has a StingRay, let alone uses it. Legal experts have been troubled by some police departments apparently misleading judges or omitting information from warrant requests about how the technology is deployed.\u00a0 Illinois\u2019 law drew bipartisan support as it unanimously passed the state legislature this year. State and local police were neutral on the bill and did not comment when Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) signed the measure into law. It takes effect Jan. 1.\u00a0 Topic praised the new law, but said it falls short of protecting citizens\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe way the technology works is that it intrudes into everyone\u2019s phone in the area, and that hasn\u2019t been really addressed,\u201d Topic said. \u201cYou\u2019d still have a Fourth Amendment problem as soon as the invasion occurs.\u201d\u00a0 He said he favors an outright ban on the technology.\u00a0 \u201cTo me that would be the best protection.\u201d'}.

The trademarks, all variations in English and Chinese on the name \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d were given preliminary approval in two lists published on the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce on Feb. 27 and Monday. The approvals underline the complexities and potential concerns over conflicts of interest facing President Trump, who has a sprawling business empire from hotels to apparel using the Trump name around the world. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, has previously said he has handed over his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons and a Trump Organization executive. He can, however, revoke the trust at will and, as its sole beneficiary, remains linked to it financially. The new trademark approvals cover such businesses as branded spas, massage parlors, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, retail shops, restaurants, bars and bodyguard and escort services. The 35 trademarks, which Trump\u2019s lawyers applied for in April last year, are registered to \u201cDonald J. Trump\u201d and listed to the address of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. The Associated Press earlier reported the approvals of the trademarks, which it said also included three further trademarks not directly registered in the President\u2019s name. These related to Scion, a hotel brand Trump\u2019s sons want to expand in the United States. Reuters could not immediately confirm the three further approvals. Representatives for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump\u2019s personal ties between politics and business have prompted concern from politicians and rights groups who say the President could face potential conflicts of interest related to the extensive business affairs of his family. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for the Departments of State, Commerce and Justice to brief Congress on the Chinese trademark approvals and on \u201cthe potential constitutional dangers that they present.\u201d \u201cThis is an astonishing development ... It\u2019s clear to me that officials in Beijing have come to appreciate the potential return on investments for China in having a positive, personal business relationship with the President of the United States,\u201d Cardin said in a statement. Cardin has previously introduced a resolution demanding Trump cut his ties with the Trump Organization or risk violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress. The preliminary approvals are open to be challenged for around a 90-day period from the date of approval. If no objections they will be formally registered in late May and early June respectively. Trump received a single trademark approval last month in China for Trump-branded construction services, following a 10-year legal battle.

The 229-foot tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 soared off a seaside launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:39 a.m. ET carrying a Dragon cargo ship bound for the station. Nine minutes after blastoff, the main section of the rocket flew back to a landing pad at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the eighth successful touchdown for Space Exploration Technologies Corp. \u201cBaby came back,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter, celebrating the re-landing, which came a day afterSpaceX decided to delay the mission 13 seconds before launch due to concerns about the steering system in the rocket\u2019s upper stage, the company said. Sunday\u2019s launch was the first for SpaceX from Launch Complex 39A, originally built for the 1960s-era Apollo moon program and later repurposed for the space shuttles. The pad was last used for the final space shuttle launch in 2011. In 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to use pad and has spent millions remodeling it. The launch was also SpaceX\u2019s first from Florida since an accident in September heavily damaged what had been the company\u2019s prime site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the NASA spaceport. Last month, SpaceX resumed flying its Falcon 9 rockets using a second launch pad in California, where the first stage of the rocket also nailed its re-landing. The company plans to reuse the rockets, slashing costs and allowing it to offer reduced pricing.

SpaceX and Boeing Co <BA.N> are scheduled to begin flying crew to the station by the end of 2018.

Advertisers have taken note: Last year Axe body spray launched a campaign called \u201cIs It OK For Guys?\u201d that tackles the vulnerabilities men are taught to suppress (Is it OK to be skinny? Is it OK to be depressed?). And Lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength. Stock photo companies say data, client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity. In the past few years, Getty searches for \u201cman meditation\u201d went up by 126 percent, \u201cman looking worried\u201d by 100 percent and \u201cgay dads\u201d by 53 percent, according to the company.\u00a0A recent Shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of U.S. marketers think it\u2019s important to use images that reflect \u201cmodern day society.\u201d \u201cYounger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity,\u201d said Robyn Lange, Shutterstock\u2019s curator. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer buckets you place these [genders] into. It\u2019s more of a spectrum.\u201d In theory, stock photography is well-poised to help people think more progressively about gender. These images are ubiquitous, appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos, where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans, travel to Hawaii and whiten our teeth.  \u201cPeople aren\u2019t aware of how much stock they\u2019re seeing every day, everywhere, on every platform,\u201d said Brenda Mills, Adobe\u2019s principal of creative services and visual trends.\u00a0\u201cAnd so it has a huge influence over people\u2019s lives.\u201d Raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally \u201cfemale\u201d jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity, rather than effeminate anomalies.  \u201cPart of what we need are images to help us create a new reality,\u201d said Tristan Bridges, an assistant sociology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cWhat would it look like if men and women didn\u2019t have to wear different types of clothes or we didn\u2019t have to imagine them in different types of jobs?\u201d But Giorgia Aiello, an associate media and communication professor at the University of Leeds in England who studies stock photos, sees these diversity collections as \u201cbranding exercises\u201d \u2015 a way to appear \u201ccutting edge\u201d rather than to truly change gender norms.  \u201cAlthough Getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography, in the end the bottom line is purely commercial,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some ways it is good they are doing it, but it\u2019s certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model.\u201d  Stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images. Getty and Shutterstock both have more than 200,000 contributors, ranging from iPhone amateurs to professionals, who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed. While companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want \u2015 more men sitting in half lotus, please \u2015 once contributors have been accepted onto the platform, they can upload whatever images they choose, so long as they aren\u2019t offensive or illegal. Getty\u2019s \u201cLean In\u201d collection, for example, represents just 0.01 percent of the company\u2019s more than 190 million images. \u201cIf someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad, despite all the memes, we can\u2019t stop them,\u201d said Merrill, though he noted that Getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on \u201cMasculinity Undone\u201d-themed shoots.\u00a0\u00a0 Stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos. In 2007, Getty\u2019s top-selling image for the search term \u201cwoman\u201d was a half-naked woman lying on a bed. Now it\u2019s a woman hiking a rocky trail. But Aiello said that doesn\u2019t necessarily equal progress. She has found that photos from the \u201cLean In\u201d collection most often appeared in \u201clightweight\u201d lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination.  \u201cQuite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science.\u201d  While it\u2019s possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics, Adobe\u2019s Mills doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. Her \u201cfashion and grooming\u201d clients currently have the biggest appetite for non-stereotypical images of men, she said, because those photos help them reach a new market. But more companies have begun to show interest.  \u201cI\u2019m surprised by some of the clients, who I thought might be more conservative, being incredibly open to this \u2018Fluid Self\u2019 trend,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually incredibly hungry for it.\u201d Getty\u2019s Merrill said that even if his customers aren\u2019t begging for more nuanced photos of men, his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction.  \u201cIt\u2019s not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want \u2015 we also want to re-picture clich\u00e9s for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where we need to be in a year or two. Our customers might not be there yet, but we know they are going to be. And we want to make sure they have the pictures and the imagery when that happens.\u201d '}.

Hammack died and another firefighter was injured when the  top of a tree they were removing from the fire area outside the town of Sisters on Thursday broke off and crashed down on  Hammack, who was 58, the Deschutes County Sheriff's Office said  in a statement. Other officials said Hammack was 60. The surviving firefighter, Norman Crawford, was treated at a  hospital for shoulder injuries and has been released, according  to local reports. Both men, contract tree fellers, were part of  a firefighting team. \"This is a tough loss for Oregon,\" said Governor John  Kitzhaber, who is set to visit a fire area in the southern part  of the West Coast state on Saturday. The current fire season has been particularly deadly in the  U.S. West. Nineteen Arizona firefighters died in June after they  became trapped by a wind-whipped inferno, and two people  perished after being caught in a blaze in Colorado. Thousands of firefighters fought to snuff out or at least  contain blazes that had burned more than 40,000 acres (16,200  hectares) of timber and range land across Oregon on Friday,  5,000 acres (2,025 hectares) more than on Thursday, said Carol  Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Northwest Interagency  Coordination Center. Nighttime and early morning lightning strikes sparked dozens  of new fires, Connelly said, adding that emergency crews were  helped by cooler temperatures and higher humidity, a streak  likely to end next week with hotter weather and possibly more  lightning-bearing storms. In neighboring Washington state, more than 2,100  firefighters were making steady progress against a pair of  blazes that have scorched more than 107,000 acres (43,300  hectares) east of the Cascade Range. About 45 structures remained at high risk from the so-called  Colockum Tarps fire burning south of Wenatchee, said Mary Ellen  Fitzgerald, a U.S. Forest Service official and a spokeswoman for  firefighting efforts. That fire, which has burned more than 80,000 acres (32,375  hectares) in less than a week, has claimed three houses and five  other buildings, including three outhouses. It was 30 percent  contained as of Friday morning as firefighters were aided by  light rain and fortuitous winds pushing smoke away from the  containment line, Fitzgerald said. Farther south, the so-called Mile Marker 28 fire, which has  blackened 27,000 acres (10, 925 hectares) close to the Oregon  border, is 75 percent contained, with residents of 69 homes  forced to flee allowed to return as of Wednesday.

He means stripping Americans of public protections that have preserved our health, safety, environment and financial security for decades. Trump may have an extreme goal, but to be honest, the overall problem is nothing too new. Since the 1980s, strong oversight of dangerous corporate practices has been slowing down in America. What we found back then was fascinating: corporations engaged in illegal behavior that were able to block government oversight sometimes changed because of lawsuits brought by everyday Americans. As a result of lawsuits then and now, auto manufacturers have been forced to make safer or remove from the market untold numbers of dangerous vehicles saving millions of lives. Many machines have been equipped with safety guards. Toxic household chemicals got warning labels. Fabrics used in children\u2019s sleepwear became flame-retardant. Dangerous and sometimes lethal birth control devices were taken off the market. On and on. Civil lawsuits have also forced disclosure of extremely important internal information about dangerous products, unsafe health care, sexual harassment and all forms of discrimination, and financial abuses. You can find explanations of many cases right here. In the documentary film \u201cHot Coffee,\u201d George Lakoff, the now-retired Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Linguistics at the University of California at Berkeley, said this about people who bring civil lawsuits: The same could be said for the trial attorneys who represent these everyday people. Hero lawyers are everywhere if you care to look. There\u2019s a young Thurgood Marshall portrayed in the new movie \u201cMarshall,\u201d who\u2019s nothing if not heroic. There are the public interest lawyers and state Attorneys General fighting Trump extremism, from the repeal of net neutrality to the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. There are trial lawyers who fight every day for their clients against insurance companies who refuse to pay legitimate claims, giant companies that cheat their customers or harm families and communities, and unsafe hospitals that kill up to 400,000 Americans each year. That all said, perhaps some negative views about lawyers are inevitable. As law professor Michael Asimow explained in his article \u201cBad Lawyers and the Movies,\u201d one problem is that lawyers are usually needed in life\u2019s worst moments, like divorce, probate of a dead parent, disputes with the IRS, bankruptcies, and juvenile crimes. And most relevant for this discussion, they are also needed at the terrible moment when someone is injured and has to sue an insurance company. And then there\u2019s this Catch 22: the public tends to criticize lawyers for doing well what individual clients most value about lawyers \u2013 aggressive, skillful representation. (See more about this in the book, Distorting the Law: Politics, Media and the Litigation Crisis by professors William Haltom and Michael McCann.) But the public perception of trial lawyers and the civil justice system has been damaged for other reasons too \u2013 reasons that were not inevitable. Over the last 35 years, a number of industry-sponsored organizations have been created to generate fear, alarm and contempt for trial lawyers and for the constitutional right of injured Americans to use the civil courts. These groups include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform, the American Tort Reform Association, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and ALEC\u2019s Civil Justice Task Force, to name just a few (e.g., here, here, here.) These interests are spending big money and exerting all their influence to change our legal system so that their members - large corporations \u2013 can spend less on safety and erase their accountability to the public. It\u2019s pretty simple. You may not trust big corporations, but I trust them to do one thing \u2013 make fatal mistakes, especially due to negligence, recklessness or in some cases, conscious disregard. Trial lawyers and their clients are the last line of defense against this kind of misconduct. We are working full-time to expose unscrupulous attacks on them. Help us fight back.'}.

The article is occasionally referenced by neo-prohibitionists to demonstrate the position of the federal government that cannabis has no known medical use in the United States. This position is beyond absurd, it is dangerous to both public health and the role of science in the public square. Medical cannabis is legal in over half of the states in the union. Tincture of cannabis (Sativex) is legal to prescribe in 24 countries. The congressionally mandated mission of NIDA is to fund studies that are designed to demonstrate negative aspects of psychoactive drugs (including cannabis), but not the positive aspects of their effect on the human body. The government seems to preferentially promote what is bad about certain drugs while they usually avoid discussing adverse effects of prescription drugs. Frankly, all one has to do is listen to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required listing of side effects on television drug ads to recognize that many FDA approved drugs have serious side effects. Cannabis does NOT have such serious side effects. As the DEA\u2019s Chief Administrative Law Judge acknowledged in 1988, cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic agents known to man. Cannabis is clearly safer than all the drugs advertised on TV. NIDA has been notorious for blocking research on cannabis by experts such as botanist Dr. Lyle Craker, oncologist Dr. Donald Abrams, and neurologist Dr. Ethan Russo. When research turns out contrary to the NIDA party line then NIDA makes every effort to bury it\u2014as they did with Dr. Donald Tashkin\u2019s research showing that not only does cannabis not cause lung cancer, but even smoked cannabis may decrease one\u2019s likelihood of getting lung cancer. This finding is consistent with dozens of basic science studies demonstrating that cannabinoids kill cancer cells. The research demonstrating the medicinal utility of cannabis is voluminous\u2014even in the face of strenuous efforts on the part of NIDA to block such research. The lack of intellectual honesty on the part of NIDA is legendary. We might be able to live with this lack of intellectual integrity if it weren\u2019t so deleterious to the nation\u2019s health and it didn\u2019t undermine good quality research. In states where cannabis is legal, deaths due to opiates decreased 25% in 2000-2010 over states where it was illegal. Cannabinoid medicine specialists have noted a decrease of opiate use in chronic pain patients of 30-50%. This is because cannabis is an analgesic. Dr. Andrea Barthwell, a former top physician and George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cdrug czar\u201d poo-poo\u2019ed the idea of medicinal cannabis. She changed her tune after she became the official spokesperson for Sativex, a whole plant cannabis extract made by British company GW Pharmaceuticals. As long ago as a decade this doctor said that this whole plant cannabis extract was not really cannabis because it is standardized. It is, in fact, made from thousands of clones grown in a greenhouse under standardized conditions and so the tincture that is produced is consistent by using a standard. Of course, because of the legal status of cannabis in the United States, the government has blocked domestic testing and standardization. Just recently the DEA denied rescheduling cannabis by rejecting the 21 studies done on Sativex by GW Pharmaceuticals who grows and makes it on the grounds that standardized cannabis was somehow not representative of cannabis in the U.S. So what else is new in bureaucratic doublespeak? Not much. In the first quarter of the 20th century marijuana was illegal in over half the states in the union. At the exact same time there were more than 25 over-the-counter preparations on the market containing cannabis available in every pharmacy in the land, and American physicians were writing about three million cannabis-containing prescriptions per year. If we continue to this charade where the DEA and NIDA are obstructing legitimate scientific research, we will only harm the American people. It appears that NIDA is blocking important research that could help to further scientifically explore and possibly further affirm the potential therapeutic properties of cannabis for treating MS, Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, seizure disorder, autism spectrum disorder and cancer. It\u2019s time for the criminal justice system and the federal government to get out of the way of science. There is important work to do for the betterment of humankind.'}.

He knew to conceal his identity, wearing ski masks and gloves,\u00a0ordering his victims not to look at him, disguising his voice in a whisper. He meticulously cased victims\u2019 neighborhoods and homes: emptying bullets from a gun, disrupting phone lines, reducing noise. He brought\u00a0shoelaces and ropes to use as makeshift handcuffs. He had a knack for parking outside of a police perimeter. He was proficient with firearms, tactically sound and skilled at making his victims comply. An escaping woman once heard him shout, \u201cFreeze!\u201d And for decades, he managed to escape authorities.  As it turns out, Joseph James DeAngelo, the 72-year-old man arrested last week on suspicion of committing a chain of rapes, murders and burglaries in California in the 1970s and \u201980s, was an ex-police officer. (He also reportedly\u00a0served in the Navy during the Vietnam War.) DeAngelo hasn\u2019t entered a plea yet, and his attorney\u00a0emphasized\u00a0that he is innocent until proven guilty.\u00a0 But if DeAngelo is the Golden State Killer, his background matters: Being in law enforcement could have helped him further his alleged crimes. And although this case is extreme \u2014 DeAngelo may have only been interested in policing to get away with wrongdoing \u2014 there\u2019s\u00a0dramatic evidence that when a person with abusive tendencies joins a police force, the tools and authority that come with being a cop may only make them more dangerous. \u201cWith his training in law enforcement, he would absolutely look to try to use that to his advantage,\u201d John Hall, the police chief at Exeter Police Department, where DeAngelo worked decades ago, told HuffPost.  Most people enter law enforcement \u201cbecause they believe it\u2019s a very noble and honorable profession, and they have a genuine desire to go out and make a positive difference,\u201d Hall added. \u201cSo when you have somebody that comes on board, and they ... betray that trust that was placed in them, it\u2019s just extremely disappointing.\u201d DeAngelo graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminal justice from California State University, Sacramento, in 1972. He did an internship in \u201cPatrol Identification and Investigation Divisions,\u201d according to a 1973\u00a0Exeter Sun article\u00a0that reported he joined Exeter Police Department in May that year.\u00a0Hall told HuffPost he had \u201cno doubt\u201d DeAngelo worked there, though there are no employee records from that time. DeAngelo then went on to work at the Auburn Police Department from 1976 to 1979, according to news reports, until he was fired after stealing a hammer and a can of dog repellent. The Auburn Police Department did not respond to a request to verify that timeline. DeAngelo would have been with the Exeter police when a spree of high-profile burglaries took place in nearby Visalia in the mid-\u201970s. Those crimes have not yet been officially linked to him, but he also appears to have been with the Auburn police\u00a0when a string of rapes occurred not far from that area. DeAngelo\u2019s public defender did not respond to a request for comment. Only around 1 percent of serial killers have a law enforcement background, not counting security guards. Out of the 5,009 serial killers in the Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database, the largest nongovernmental serial murderer database in the world,\u00a032 were former members of law enforcement and 25 were in law enforcement for at least part of their series of murders, according to Michael Aamodt, a professor emeritus at Radford University in Virginia. Two other serial killers were ex-military police, and 44 were security guards. DeAngelo was an officer in sleepy communities decades ago, and it\u2019s unclear how much serious policing he did. He reportedly caught a toilet-papering teenager, and the police department in Auburn\u00a0mostly handled property crimes.\u00a0 But law enforcement experience might help a killer to conduct surveillance, physically and verbally force a victim to comply, and conceal evidence. Today, police officers have access to sophisticated information databases, but even in the \u201970s, DeAngelo may have been able to view information disseminated about his alleged crimes. (It\u2019s unknown if he did so.) Additionally, once someone works as a cop, that experience and those instincts can become deeply ingrained. Investigators had suspected that the Golden State Killer could be a police officer and/or have a military background, said Larry Pool, a former investigator with the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department who spent more than 20 years working on the case. Pool personally believed that \u201cour offender would be someone who, while needing to control people, would not be very good at controlling themselves,\u201d and he suspected the offender wouldn\u2019t be successful for long in those careers. Nonetheless, Pool said he wouldn\u2019t have excluded somebody who was \u201cvery successful\u201d in the military or law enforcement.  Pool documented names of police officers, detectives and emergency personnel who touched the case, and followed up on them to determine what they\u2019d done since the series of crimes, he noted.  In his view, DeAngelo was not a real police officer, but \u201csomeone who came into law enforcement wanting to be placed in a position of control and authority,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d  Policing experts say vigilant screening and oversight can be key to making sure a violent person stays out of a police force. \u201cLaw enforcement agencies do a pretty good job now of screening for violent-type tendencies,\u201d said David Thomas,\u00a0a program manager for the International Association of Chiefs of Police who focuses on addressing violence against women. But for anyone looking to bolster their hiring practices, \u201cI would want to do a case study on everything that they can connected to the [DeAngelo] case to learn from it.\u201d\u00a0 Screening is not infallible. So when victims report officer abuse to internal affairs departments, for example, those complaints must be taken seriously, victim advocates say. (A HuffPost investigation on officer-involved domestic violence found that even minor-sounding complaints can reflect deeper problems.)  Although the Golden State Killer is an extreme case and the crimes took place decades ago, keeping forces free of bad apples is just as important today, particularly as communities of color continue to distrust police and may feel that badly behaving officers are protected rather than held accountable.  \u201cPolice have tremendous authority, and they get information and access that simply isn\u2019t available to most people,\u201d said Seth Stoughton, an assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina and a former police officer. \u201cThere are plenty of concerns that arise from the risk that officers will slightly misuse their knowledge and authority \u2014 and what this guy did was not a slight misuse.\u201d  Nick Willick, the former Auburn police chief who fired DeAngelo decades ago for shoplifting, told\u00a0Fox40\u00a0he was \u201cpersonally embarrassed\u201d that his ex-colleague had turned out to be the alleged killer. \u201cIt\u2019s a black eye,\u201d Willick said. \u201cNot just on my department but law enforcement.\u201d'}.

The agencies with regulatory responsibilities in this market include HUD/FHA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I will illustrate with two objectives, both of which are designed to empower the \u201clittle guy.\u201d 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduce barriers to effective mortgage shopping. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduce mortgage transactions costs. Step 2: \u00a0Identify Remediable Deficiencies The major focus of the agencies in assessing their regulations should be to identify the major deficiencies that are preventing their objectives from being realized.\u00a0 For the mortgage-related agencies, Step 2 would include the following deficiencies bearing on the two objectives cited above. 1.\u00a0 Lender control of appraisals makes them non-portable and lengthens transaction periods, both of which impede the ability of borrowers to shop effectively. 2.\u00a0 The cost of title insurance paid by borrowers is excessive relative to the costs incurred in assessing the validity of titles. Step 3: Assess Existing and Alternative Regulations I will illustrate with the two objectives and deficiencies cited above. The Difficulty in Shopping: The core problem potential borrowers face in shopping for a mortgage is that critically important information bearing on its price, including the value of the property, is not available to them until after they have applied for a loan and paid for an appraisal. For a borrower to withdraw at this point in order to begin again with another lender is difficult, costly and time-consuming, so few do it. Relevant Existing Regulations: The regulations applicable to appraisals are a major source of the problem. While borrowers pay for appraisals, the regulations place responsibility and control with lenders, who order them after a borrower has applied. This lengthens the period the borrower must wait for the information needed to shop, and it also means that the borrower who withdraws from the process must pay for a new appraisal and wait out the results once again. A Better Regulatory Approach: If regulations obliged lenders to accept an appraisal ordered by a borrower from any approved appraisal management company, the borrower would at last have the capacity to shop for the best deal. With an appraisal in hand, the shopper could invite multiple lenders to make a firm offer at a specified date and time. Making appraisals portable is one of the simplest and most effective ways to empower consumers. Bringing that about would require replacement of one set of regulations with another set. The Excessive Price of Title Insurance: Assuring good title is necessary for an effective housing and mortgage market, but title insurance is not necessary for that purpose. Denmark has a reliable system of recording titles but no title insurance. Relevant Existing Law: Existing law allows lenders to shift to the borrower the cost of title insurance that protects the lender. This prevents the efficient application of existing technology that would reduce the cost of assuring good titles to a small fraction of the cost of title insurance. The problem is that lenders have no financial incentive to shift to a more efficient system \u2013 in fact, many have a financial interest in the title agencies to which they refer customers. A Better Regulatory Approach: If the law required lenders to pay for title insurance themselves, passing the cost to the borrower in the price of the mortgage, lenders would have an incentive to drive down the cost rather than to share in the revenue. The result would be a precipitous decline in the cost of title insurance, and eventually the replacement of the industry with an automated system open to all market participants. If this new and very simple regulation applied to mortgage insurance as well as title insurance, which should be the case, it would make a large set of existing regulations obsolete. These are the regulations that apply to referral fees, which deal with such weighty matters as whether a birthday present from a title agent or a mortgage insurance salesperson, to a lender, constitutes a prohibited referral fee. Good riddance. Concluding Comment The President says he wants to reduce the number of regulations.\u00a0 I interpret that to mean that he wants to replace regulations that are directed toward worthy objectives but don\u2019t work with regulations that do work, and I have given some examples. Regulations that ought to be scrapped rather than replaced will be discussed in another article. \u00a0 For more information on mortgages or to shop for a mortgage in an unbiased environment, visit my website The Mortgage Professor'}.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is a longtime investor in a winery that was sued in 2016 for auctioning off a yacht party that\u00a0allegedly involved cocaine and prostitutes, The Fresno Bee reported.\u00a0 Alene Anase, a former employee of Alpha Omega Winery, said the company had auctioned a 2015 cruise aboard its yacht for charity. Anase was asked to serve the 25 winning bidders, who were all men, according to court documents the Bee posted online.\u00a0No owners or investors were on the cruise, the winery told the Bee.\u00a0 According to the lawsuit: \u201cPlaintiff realized that the men had brought prostitutes, hard liquor, and what appeared to be cocaine onto the Yacht. Plaintiff was extremely disturbed by the presence of the prostitutes, especially because it appeared that some of the girls were too young to consent to sexual activity.\u201d Anase\u2019s lawsuit was eventually settled for an undisclosed amount, according to the Bee. The suit included six allegations, including sexual harassment, emotional distress and retaliation. The men aboard the yacht\u00a0\u201cconsumed large quantities of alcohol and a white substance Plaintiff understood to be cocaine,\u201d the suit alleged, saying that at least one of the men approached Anase for sexual services and stated that she feared being sexually assaulted.\u00a0 According to the lawsuit, when Anase complained, the company\u2019s marketing director allegedly ordered her to \u201c\u2018lie low\u2019 and try to do as little as possible in order to avoid harassment.\u201d The suit also claimed that Anase received counseling for psychological trauma, took medication for anxiety and depression, and suffered from panic and sleep problems, all as a result of the cruise. Wine Business reported on the lawsuit in 2016 and said Alpha Omega Winery had continued to auction cruises for charity after the incident.\u00a0 \u201cWe refined our policies for the charitable donation of the yacht immediately upon learning of the incident and before a lawsuit was filed,\u201d winery spokeswoman Kelly Carter told the website at the time.\u00a0 Robin Baggett, whom the Bee describes as a friend of Nunes, owns Alpha Omega Winery.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear how big of a stake Nunes has in the business, but the Bee reported that he is one of at least 50 investors, investing between $50,000 and $100,000 after selling his dairy farm in 2006 and earning between $2,501 and $5,000 from his investment in 2016.\u00a0 The House Intelligence Committee chairman has not spoken much about the winery publicly over the years. However, when Time asked in 2010 what he would be doing if he wasn\u2019t in politics, he said, \u201cI\u2019d be making wine and cheese.\u201d\u00a0 He did not comment on the yacht allegations, according to the Bee.\u00a0 The Los Angeles Times said Nunes has three main assets: stakes in two wineries (Phase 2 Cellars and Alpha Omega Winery LLC)\u00a0and a Bank of America savings account. The three are worth a combined $101,000, the outlet noted.\u00a0'}. Classify it into the appropriate category.
