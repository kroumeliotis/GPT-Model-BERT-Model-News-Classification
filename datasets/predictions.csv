We Asked The American Public To Settle 5 Of The Internet's Dumbest Debates,"Survey research allows us to get a sense of how the nation as a whole feels about current events, rather than trying to draw inferences from the people we know, or from the groups stating their opinions the most loudly. Sometimes, if we’re lucky, it also allows us to get a scientifically valid perspective on whatever people are yelling about on the internet. This week, that would be whether the voice in a random sound bite is saying the name “Yanny” or “Laurel.” It’s actually “Laurel.” The U.S., however, is a country where most voters don’t believe people can agree on basic facts. And when we asked 1,000 Americans to listen to the audio as part of a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, the responses showed little signs of consensus: 35 percent said “Yanny,” 31 percent said “Laurel,” and 14 percent didn’t hear either. The rest weren’t sure. The poll seemingly supports the theory that age may play a role in the differing perceptions, with younger people more attuned to the higher-frequency sounds ― and more likely to fall into the “Yanny” camp. Americans under age 30 were Team Yanny by an 18-point margin, compared to just an 8-point margin for those aged 30-44. Americans aged 45-64 and those 65 or older were Team Laurel by a 2-point margin and a 5-point margin, respectively. While we were at it, we asked our respondents to weigh in on four more pressing internet controversies (no, not The Dress ... we already did that one). And while most political polling demonstrates just how polarized the country is along partisan lines, the results of this survey suggest there are also some major generational fault lines in our assumptions on everything from the meaning of internet acronyms to how we classify our food. BuzzFeed touched off an internet firestorm when they asked earlier this month. Once again, we’re a nation divided: 29 percent say “humble,” 32 percent say “honest,” and the rest say it’s neither or that they’re not sure. And once again, there’s a notable generational divide, with younger Americans far more likely to think it’s “honest.” There’s also an educational gap, with college grads saying by an 18-point margin that it’s “humble,” and those without a degree saying by an 11-point margin that it’s “honest.” (Side note: BuzzFeed’s reader poll found “honest” winning by a significant margin. That makes sense, since the site probably has disproportionately younger readers. It’s also a good reminder that reader polls ― the kind that allow anyone browsing a website to answer, and don’t keep track of the demographics of the people responding, or use weighting to make sure they match the composition of the nation as a whole ― aren’t a representative gauge of anything beyond the opinions of the people who click on them.) The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council has weighed in. So have Stephen Colbert and John Hodgman. Here’s the court of public opinion: a 53 percent majority say no, with just 35 percent believing that it is, and the remaining 12 percent having better things to do with their lives. Results are impressively consistent along a number of demographic lines. A roughly equivalent 56 percent of Democrats, 53 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents agree on a hot dog’s lack of sandwich status. There’s no sign of an education, racial or gender gap either. Age, however, once again comes into play. Americans under age 45 overwhelmingly contest the hot dog’s claim to sandwichness. Their older compatriots are closer to evenly split. There’s also a regional divide, with Midwesterners most amenable to Team Sandwich, and Northeasterners by far the least so. This is another perennial debate to flare up this month, thanks to an article in The Washington Post. By a 11-point margin, 47 percent to 36 percent, Americans prefer one space.  Americans under 30 are overwhelmingly Team One Space, while those over 65 are closely divided. There’s also an educational divide, with those who hold college degrees preferring two spaces, and those without favoring just one. The creator of the GIF says it’s with a soft “G,” like “giraffe.” But he’s outnumbered: 63 percent of the American public disagrees, preferring the hard “G,” as in “gift.” Not a single demographic group examined in the survey, regardless of age, education or anything else, prefers the soft “G.”  Glad that’s all settled! The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 15-16 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here. Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.",POLITICS,TECH
Aquarium To Monitor Animals' Behavior Changes During Eclipse,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Animals in the path of the first total solar eclipse to travel across the United States in 99 years have a big surprise awaiting them on Monday afternoon, biologists say. Zoos, aquariums and other wildlife parks see the celestial phenomenon as a special research opportunity to observe how birds and mammals react when the moon’s shadow blots out most of the sun’s light in the middle of the day, experts say. The South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston, the last spot over which the total eclipse will pass during its coast-to-coast journey, will carefully monitor the behavior of creatures during the minute and 36 seconds when the area goes dark. Biologists have set up video cameras in the Salt Marsh Aviary and Mountain Forest exhibits to gather data. In general, researchers are not particularly concerned that the sudden mid-afternoon darkness will upset animals too much even though the eclipse’s approach will come as a complete surprise to them. “A little bit of excitement in the days of the animals is a good thing,” said aviculturist Monty Wallace. “You don’t want the same thing happening to you everyday.” Past solar eclipses have left animals appearing confused, with the disappearing sunlight throwing off their circadian rhythms, research shows. Birds at Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park fell silent while others flew in the direction of their roosts during an eclipse in 2001, while hippos “paused and looked nervous,” according to a study published in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics. The Charleston aquarium’s aviary exhibit is home to two pelicans, six different types of ducks, two white ibises, two types of seagulls and two herons. One of them, a yellow-crowned night heron, is nocturnal, while the other, a little blue heron, is active during the day. “I’m interested to see the different behaviors that they would have naturally occurring but at a wrong time of the day, being in the middle of the day when the eclipse happens,” Wallace said. The nocturnal heron may forage for food instead of hiding in a tree, its normal daytime behavior, the biologist said, while the little blue heron may take refuge in the trees out of fear of nocturnal predators. .@NASA360 is at the @SCaquarium with @NASAKennedy's Josh Santora prepping for #eclipse2017! Watch us live Aug. 21 at https://t.co/yzOtRd3Bt8 pic.twitter.com/y6RX7RvSEq Kendle Enter, who works as the animal behaviorist senior biologist at the aquarium, is not expecting any changes in the behavior of two river otters in the Mountain Forest exhibit. At midday on Monday, when the moon’s shadow will begin to cross the sun in Charleston, the otters are usually sleeping, she said. Totality is expected at 2:46 p.m., after the otters awaken from their naps. “They’re either going to sleep through it or they’re going to wake up, expecting their food,” Enter said. On its website, NASA recommends solar eclipse watchers find out for themselves how animals behave during the eclipse by simply observing pets or local wildlife. An app called iNaturalist is available to record observations and submit them online to compile a database about animal behavior during the eclipse.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
SpaceX Rocket Blasts Off Carrying NASA's New Planet-Hunting Telescope,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida on Wednesday on SpaceX’s first high-priority science mission for NASA, a planet-hunting orbital telescope designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system that might be capable of harboring life. The Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, lifted off on schedule from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:51 p.m. EDT, following a two-day postponement forced by a technical glitch found on Monday in the rocket’s guidance-control system. Within minutes of the launch, the main-stage booster separated from the upper part of the rocket and flew itself back to Earth for a successful touchdown on an unmanned landing vessel floating in the Atlantic. The @NASA_TESS spacecraft is now safely in space after a beautiful launch. It will spend the next 60 days getting to its proper orbit where it will search for unknown worlds beyond our solar system: https://t.co/Q7B7dMs7sM pic.twitter.com/qN4RK3oTLs NASA’s latest astrophysics satellite, meanwhile, soared on toward orbit, starting the clock on a two-year, $337 million quest to expand astronomers’ known catalog of so-called exoplanets, worlds circling distant stars. Wednesday’s blastoff was a milestone of sorts for Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, the private launch service owned by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. The California-based company has launched cargo missions and other payloads for NASA before. But TESS marks the first under a special certification SpaceX has obtained to carry one of NASA’s highest-priority science instruments. TESS is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, the Kepler space telescope, which discovered the bulk of some 3,700 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years and is running out of fuel. NASA expects to pinpoint thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or “super-Earth” sized - no larger than twice as big as our home planet. Those are believed the most likely to feature rocky surfaces or oceans and are thus considered the best candidates for life to evolve. Scientists said they hope TESS will ultimately help catalog at least 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study in what has become one of astronomy’s newest fields of exploration. “TESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,” TESS principal investigator George Ricker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told reporters in a pre-launch briefing on Sunday. Roughly the size of a refrigerator with solar-panel wings and four special cameras, TESS will take about 60 days to reach a highly elliptical orbit between Earth and the moon to begin its observations. Like Kepler, TESS will use a detection method called transit photometry, which looks for periodic, repetitive dips in the visible light of stars caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of them. TESS will focus on 200,000 pre-selected stars that are relatively nearby and among the brightest as seen from Earth, making them better-suited for sensitive follow-up analysis. The telescope will concentrate on stars called red dwarfs, smaller, cooler and longer-lived than our sun. Red dwarfs also have a high propensity for Earth-sized, presumably rocky planets, making them potentially fertile ground for further scrutiny.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

Conor McGregor Calls Floyd Mayweather's Strip Club A 'Crack Den',"The trash talk had already turned downright offensive. Now it just took a turn for the absurd. In remarks before his fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr. on Saturday in Las Vegas, Conor McGregor called the boxer’s strip club a “crack den.” Praising his own business acumen, the UFC lightweight champion McGregor then criticized Mayweather’s recent opening of the Girl Collection. “That strip club is bleeding money from him and he knows it,” McGregor said on Wednesday in a video posted by MMA Junkie. “And he’s talking about franchising it and the thing looks like a crack den.” “And that’s no disrespect to the people that are in there,” he added. (He took a few other shots at the club. See them below at the 2:30 mark.) The comments about the club, while potentially insulting to employees, may hit closer to home for Mayweather than one might think. He has frequently promoted Girl Collection on Twitter, even as the buildup toward the fight began to peak. He is even expected to to hang out there the night before the ballyhooed showdown. Mayweather, who has an alarming history of violence against women, explained to Jimmy Kimmel earlier this month that he opened the club because “breasts, vaginas, music and alcohol will never go out of style.” Ugh.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Goals 2017:  Tax Planning & Timing,"If one of your New Year's resolutions was to plan better for your taxes or simply to file your tax return earlier this year - good for you! With 2017 came a lot of changes to IRS systems and process and therefore changes to your tax return. Some of the changes are required by laws and others because of new security measures - regardless of the cause here is what you need to know. Safety first! The IRS indicated, ""The 2017 safeguards are aimed at those of you who prepare your own federal and state tax returns using tax software."" Though many of the safeguards happen behind the scenes and you won't need to do anything, there are some services and self-help tools that will require you to use Secure Access. Secure Access is designed to protect your data and IRS systems from thieves. You must have a mobile phone, an email address, and various pieces of your personal information to register.  Plan ahead and review the article Tips for Successfully Authenticating Your Identity through Secure Access on the IRS website. If you prepare your own tax return and plan to file electronically, you will need much of the same information listed and your prior year adjusted gross income (AGI) or prior-year Self-Select PIN; you will no longer be able to use an electronic filing PIN. If you use a Tax Pro, they should collect only the appropriate data needed to file your tax return and manage the safeguards for you.  Despite some rumors to the contrary, the Affordable Care Act is NOT dead for 2016, which means a) You had to have insurance for the entire year, b) Qualify for an exemption, or c) May be subject to a penalty. For many people, the various Forms 1095 contains the information they need - who was covered and when. However, the deadline for issuing the form depends on who is issuing it: Form 1095-A, issued by the Health Insurance Marketplace must be provided by January 31, 2017, but both Form 1095-B, which is issued by health insurance providers, and Form 1095-C, issued by certain employers for self-insured coverage, aren't due until March 2, 2017. According to the IRS, for those that obtained insurance through the Marketplace it is important to receive Form 1095-A before you file your tax return; however, you do not need to include the form with your tax return. If you aren't sure how to prepare your tax return correctly with regard to the ACA information, consult your Tax Pro or review the information on the IRS Affordable Care Act Tax Provisions page. Tax refunds, some of the biggest ones, are often a result of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and/or the Child Tax Credits (CTC/ACTC). One of the changes that will have the biggest impact on taxpayers is a result of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015. Among other things, the PATH Act requires the IRS to hold refunds for returns that claim the EITC or the CTC/ACTC until February 15. The IRS has been releasing various posts, articles, and tweets about the refund delays and how they should help stop fraudulent returns. For frequently asked questions, see Refund Timing for Earned Income Tax Credit and Additional Child Tax Credit Filers on the IRS website. However, just because the IRS won't process your refund until February 15 does not mean that you shouldn't file your return early though. The sooner you get your tax return filed, the sooner you don't have to worry about it anymore and the less likely you are to be a victim of Tax ID Theft.   For people without a Social Security number and who must file a tax return, an Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) is required. Many ITINs expired December 31, 2016 either because they were not used for a tax return in 2013, 2014, or 2015, they were issued before 2008, or the middle digits were 78 or 79. If your ITIN expired, processing of your tax return will be delayed and if the delay is beyond April 18, you could lose the Child Tax Credits and the American Opportunity Credits.  You must have an SSN for yourself, your spouse and your dependents as of April 18, 2017 to claim EITC on your 2016 tax return. If you are looking for help, the IRS urges you to start with IRS.gov for all their resources. If you want in-person help, all IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers are now by appointment only. With the changes in the tax law, the new security safeguards, and the delayed processing of returns, this might be the year to hire a Tax Pro. And if one of your goals for 2017 is to keep more of your money in your pocket, investing in a Tax Pro might just be one of the most economical - time and money wise - decisions you make that will help you reach your goals.  Like it or not, it is tax time! Give a bit more thought to what can be your single biggest financial transaction this year; it is your money, keep more of it.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
"Tax Scams Are On The Rise, And Recognizing Them Is Getting Harder","By Meghan Hudson, Financial Counselor, New York Legal Assistance Group Death and taxes, they say, are the only certainties in life, so perhaps it should come as no surprise that being victimized by a taxpayer fraud scheme is becoming more common. These lucrative schemes are increasing in number and complexity around the world. Many of the scammers pressure taxpayers to make immediate payments and threaten license suspension, deportation or arrest if they don’t. Their sophisticated methods can be very convincing. This summer we had a client fall prey: she lost $3,500 of her savings to a fraudster via iTunes Gift Cards. She is one of many who were defrauded and certainly won’t be the last. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service announced in April that it has hired private debt collection companies to collect past taxes (despite two failed attempts at privatizing tax debt collection in the past), adding a new wrinkle and making it more difficult to know what’s real and what’s a scam. And, as reported last week in the New York Times, a group of Democratic senators have found that the IRS’s private collectors are using tactics that are not just high-pressure, but may be illegal. The article describes training scripts that suggest that debtors use 401(k) funds, home loans and credit cards to pay off their overdue taxes. Pushing taxpayers to the limit like this can have dire consequences. There are other options that we’ll discuss below. Both fraudsters and IRS contractors have the same goal: they want your money – and they have little incentive to deal fairly with people who legitimately cannot afford to pay their taxes.  The following are steps you can take to determine whether you are dealing with a real IRS debt or a scammer, and what your options are if it’s legit. There are only four debt collection agencies that can collect IRS debt: CBE, ConServe, Performant and Pioneer. Unlike the scammer, the IRS will inform you first by mail of the tax debt and indicate the debt collector assigned to your case. Only then will you get a call. If you are contacted by anyone who is not affiliated with one of these companies, you are at risk of being defrauded. If you owe back taxes, you will need to pay them, but make sure you’re really paying your tax debt and not lining the pocket of a scam artist. Keep some things in mind. The IRS-approved debt collection companies will NOT ask for a payment via iTunes or other gift cards, or prepaid debt cards. Payments and checks should only be made be payable to the U.S. Treasury and sent directly to the IRS regardless of what collection agency you are working with. You can also pay online at www.IRS.gov/PayYourTaxBill. You have the right to work with the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) and to get a financial analysis of your economic situation in order to assess proper payment options. The IRS must take basic living expenses into consideration when determining ability to pay. The average monthly Allowed Living Expenses in New York City, for example, is $3,132 for a single person household. But, keep in mind that private debt collection companies are not required to refer hardship accounts to the TAS and are free to try to collect on debt that would otherwise be uncollectable by the IRS. If you can’t afford the payment, call the TAS yourself or visit their website. A TAS Taxpayer Advocate can put you on a payment plan that is affordable based on your income. The debt collectors tasked with collecting IRS tax debt must follow the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The IRS must inform you of the debt that will be transferred and to whom. They can’t engage in harassing or abusive practices. To make a complaint about a private collection agency or report misconduct by its employee, call the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) hotline at 800-366-4484 or visit www.tigta.gov. You have a right to know how much you owe in taxes and how the amount was calculated. You can call the TAS at 800-829-1040 or go online to https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/ and create a Secure Access Account on the IRS website. In the tax account tools page you can see 18 months of payment history, the balance for each tax year that you owe and the payoff amount. Don’t ask the person on the phone to validate it, make sure it’s correct with the IRS. While you are sorting out your situation – and your options, do not agree to a payment plan that you can’t afford. Do not live off your credit cards or withdraw money from your retirement savings to pay off the tax debt. (This is often taxed as income and if you’re under 59.5 years old there are additional ramifications, such as early withdraw fees.) According to the same New York Times article, a recent analysis found that nearly a quarter of the accounts involved taxpayers with below-poverty level wages, and more than half were taxpayers with incomes of less than 250 percent of the poverty level. If you have an economic hardship, the TAS can place you into a status known as Currently Not Collectible which means that the IRS will stop trying to collect the debt from you and won’t garnish wages – though your tax debt will continue to accumulate interest and penalties. The TAS can also approve Offer in Compromise plans, an agreement to settle the debt for less than the full amount. It’s better to work with a Taxpayer Advocate to get on a payment plan that allows you to still cover your basic needs. I suggest you create a budget before creating a payment plan and see how much you can afford to pay. If you don’t qualify for either program you can work with a TAS advocate to create a longer installment plan so that your monthly payments are affordable. In summary, when it comes to calls related to tax debt don’t be bullied into making an immediate payment. Validate the debt and take a realistic look at your income. If you indeed owe the debt, you will need to pay it or a portion of it. However, make sure that you are paying a reasonable amount based on your income and that you’re not living on borrowed money or surviving solely on ramen noodles to make it happen. And don’t hesitate to reach out to your politicians and demand they promote policies that protect your rights. Private debt collection programs have historically wasted federal resources and violated consumer rights.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS

Sports Illustrated Cover Makes Powerful Show Of Unity,"The presence of activism on the sports field dates back decades to the civil rights movement, and should unite athletes in the protest controversy engulfing the American professional sports landscape, according to Sports Illustrated. “Athletes Are Not Going to ‘Stick to Sports’ and That’s an Admirably American Thing,” is the title of this week’s cover piece. The cover illustration shows professional athletes and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell ― all in black and white ― linking arms in front of a red, white and blue backdrop. Hundreds of athletes and dozens of team owners decided to kneel, sit, link arms or otherwise protest during national anthems across the country at Sunday’s games after President Donald Trump stoked the flames, encouraging team owners to fire a “son a bitch” who disrespects the American flag. THIS WEEK'S COVER: In a nation divided, the sports world is coming together https://t.co/aONQ0a141s pic.twitter.com/rvuXVmiHq7 Sports Illustrated writer Charles Pierce offers several examples of moments when political activism in relation with the national anthem have gotten athletes into trouble, both in the U.S. and around the world. Today’s protests, he wrote, are to be expected because “the inclusion of a national anthem—any national anthem—in a sporting event necessarily politicizes that event.” The difference, he added, is that today’s protests aren’t directly about the government, but are more about the activity of an entity linked to the government. “The protestors are high-profile African-American athletes raising awareness of how lower-profile African-Americans are often mistreated by police officers.” Strong, effective messaging, Pierce continued, is bound to make some people uncomfortable. Trump, among other things, says the protests are disrespecting the country. Those who love their country, he added, stay away from NFL games altogether these days. The White House chief of staff chimed in, telling CNN he was appalled by players’ lack of respect. “Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes,” John Kelly said.  Yet sports and politics are inherently tied, as HuffPost’s Travis Waldron notes. “The existence of the NFL as a multibillion-dollar business enterprise today is a direct result of its aggressive political engagement ― a tradition that is, in fact, older than the Super Bowl. The league doesn’t stick to sports; why should its players?”",SPORTS,SPORTS

Delta Under Fire After Pilot Appears To Hit Passenger,"A major airline is under fire this weekend and, no, it’s not United.  A Delta Air Lines pilot sparked controversy on Saturday after a video appeared to show him hitting a passenger. In the footage, posted on TMZ, a skirmish breaks out among two passengers exiting a flight at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The pilot steps in to intervene and, in doing so, appears to abruptly smack one woman.  The fight quickly breaks up and the passengers are escorted away by security. According to The New York Times, the incident took place on April 21. Delta said the pilot was initially suspended, but was cleared after an investigation. The company said in a statement:  We became aware of this incident and a video last week and immediately removed the pilot from duty while we completed a thorough investigation. Local law enforcement was called to respond at the time of the incident. The pilot has since been returned to work as our investigation found that his actions de-escalated an altercation between passengers on the Jetway floor during deplaning.  The airline also made headlines earlier this week after a passenger claimed he was kicked off a flight for using the bathroom. The controversies come on the heels of the ongoing criticism facing United Airlines after a passenger was dragged off a flight. The airline initially defended the incident but, after widespread scrutiny from consumers and Congress, later apologized. United settled with the passenger and agreed to change some of its policies. Its CEO, Oscar Munoz, will testify in a related House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing this week.

Will Whoever Controls Gene Editing Control Historical Memory?,"In July, Harvard scientists used a gene-editing technology first developed in 2013 to programme bacteria to do something astounding: play back an animation of a galloping horse. The GIF animation was generated from an iconic image series created in 1878 by the motion-picture pioneer Eadweard Muybridge. Scientists uploaded a GIF of a galloping horse into live bacteria using Crispr https://t.co/4UKxvXerdc pic.twitter.com/fKCfJM0hXO The breakthrough involved the scientists translating image pixels into genetic code, which they fed to the cells one frame at a time. The bacteria incorporated and reproduced the sequence in their DNA, demonstrating the possibility of using living cells as information recording and storage devices. The tech world was, predictably, agog. But beyond the hype, scientists’ goal of applying the technique to human cells has deep philosophical implications. A future in which our bodies are used as hard drives could, in effect, change the entire way we conceive of human history and perceive life. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without history: from the vast array of chronicles housed in the world’s libraries to the countless traces of the past accumulating in the data farms that support the digital cloud, history surrounds us. But it wasn’t always this way. Starting around 4000 BCE, the rise and spread of city-states, from Mesopotamia to Ancient Greece, radically changed the relationship between humans and our physical world. New patterns of governance and information technology produced what’s now called “historical time”, a regime of truth based on evidence and analysis that’s codified in written documents and housed within the walls of archives. These new systems of authority gradually supplanted the sense of time that had previously defined the reality of ancient peoples: the seasons, oral traditions, myths and rituals. With the onset of historical time, change no longer appeared cyclical. The concept of progress emerged, establishing a vision of humankind moving forward, shaping the world, building knowledge and recording evidence of this journey. But, of course, the whole notion of progress depends on power. Someone (or more likely a certain subset of people) must select the perspectives that count as knowledge. Which events are memorialized and which disappear from history? Thus history is far from neutral. From antiquity onward, those controlling history were a privileged few, nearly always men of political power or professional status. Access required literacy and social mobility. With the Age of Reason came a broad-based questioning of this power. In his 1784 essay “What is Enlightenment?”, Immanuel Kant argued the importance of challenging the authority and legitimacy of practices and norms that restrict the power to reason for oneself. Soon after, in 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft published A Vindication of the Rights of Women. Her argument for the education and representation of women in civic life signalled the absence of female voices from history. The book’s emancipatory message was, however, soon subsumed by new forces. The power to systematise reality expanded dramatically in the 19th century, with industrialisation, technological developments and the spread of the scientific method. Photography brought a seeming realism to the documenting of history. Charles Darwin transformed our concept of the origins and timelines of the species and Sigmund Freud described how an individual’s past shapes their psyche. These spectacular developments continued in the 20th century. Enabled by modern computing, scientists explored time at a cosmic scale (the theory of relativity) and explained life at a molecular level (the discovery of DNA). In this great tide of change, some 180 years after Kant and Wollstonecraft, a wave of critical movements finally took history to task. Among these critiques was Michel Foucault’s analysis of systems that regulate our physical body and mental states. From The Birth of the Clinic, his 1963 work on the rising authority of medical knowledge, to his 1975 publication on institutions that discipline society, Foucault studied the Western desire for total oversight, famously citing the Panopticonprison model. From the critical vantage point, the impact of power – and of the technologies it employs to represent, monitor and control individuals and populations – becomes clear. Feminists spoke of the male gaze. Postcolonial theorists pointed to orientalism. And environmentalists have shown how human progress is destroying the physical world. Hence the risks of this recent application of CRISPR: envisaging history as a biological resource rather than a space of social memory is a dramatic shift that leaves history open to radical new forms of exclusion and control. The scientists’ interest in “molecular recording” in humans and the production of “cell historians” promises to take the management of life, time and the visual arena to new levels. In doing so, they raise the prospect of a Panopticon within. Today, progress is increasingly defined by the power of digital technologies to integrate different aspects of human life and abolish the gaps between us. We’re told that social networks, big data and the digital world make us safer, more productive and connected. But not everyone agrees. The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues that globalisation and the information economy makes for a liquid reality that fragments our attention span, dissolves relationships and produces cultural amnesia. The Harvard team proposes an image of history that is not a record of culture – the ensemble of ways of living, transmitted across generations – but a sum of the material states of humans. This removes the record of social life that conditions how bodies live. The scientists emphasise the technique’s use in modelling diseases and creating therapies. Those benefits may be real, but so too is what Foucault describes as biopower: the use of wide-ranging technologies to administer and dominate human life. If scientists can embed information in living human cells and extract data, behaviour can be regulated at the deepest levels. Who will decide how the power of molecular recording is wielded, and who has access to the information? The ways in which history is made, shared and accessed determine how its power operates and reality is produced. As we both subscribe to and are uploaded into the net of digital reality, the issue of control over data raises new questions of agency. The fact that political and market interests drive the application of science in technology – with their stealthy logic of monitoring, expansion and profit – exacerbates questions of control. As the Harvard team’s use of bacteria shows, we’ve come a long way since the single-cell, bacterium-like form that in all likelihood spawned the wonder of life on the planet today. Their gene-editing project demonstrates technology’s capacity to systematise time in new ways. It epitomises the conditions of the Network Ages: the compression, acceleration and dispersion of life. But as the richness of life and historical memory demonstrate, culture is more than information, and the diversity of life exceeds technological measure. Can we trust that scientific leaps will produce a future where diversity is supported and divergence is possible? To answer that question, we must do more than simply laud new technologies like CRISPR. We must examine how power can function commensurate with these techniques’ newly expanded reach.

"The Pluto Flyby Is Nearing Its End, But We Can Still Visit In VR","I started tracking around the Sputnik Planum on the left chamber of Pluto’s icy heart. I picked up a rock bigger than myself and threw it to watch it float away in the slow motion that comes with low gravity. I went up icy mountains, and looked around — there were miles of rugged cratered terrain, bearing witness to the dwarf planet’s old history of meteor showers. Then I went back to my virtual spaceship, hovering under a starry sky and a dim blob of a sun, to transport myself to Krun Macula, the dark regions named after a mythical lord of the underworld. It can be both exhilarating and dizzying to walk up and down Pluto’s cliffs in the immersive world of virtual reality, especially for the uninitiated like me. But I was mostly amazed to find myself in a virtual world composed entirely of images and data acquired and sent to Earth by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft only a year ago. My virtual visit to Pluto took place at an event held by CuriosityStream, a young company that provides subscription-based streaming of documentary film. The VR experience is an appendix to an 11-episode series called “Destination: Pluto,” said Jorge Franzini, a producer of the series.  Planetary scientist Alan Stern, the principal investigator of NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto, also got a chance to put on goggles and walk around. “I was very impressed. I want them to VR the rest of the planet. The samples they did were fabulous,” he said.  It all started with a postal stamp in 1991, which read “Pluto Not Yet Explored.” That’s how Stern likes to begin telling the story of the Pluto mission and how scientists were motivated to better understand the dwarf planet’s unique status in our solar system. Pluto, first discovered in 1930, is so far away that hardly any reliable data about it could make it to Earth. But in July 2015, on its 9-year, 3-billion-mile journey, New Horizons flew past Pluto. The spacecraft’s high-resolution photos revealed its surprisingly complex geology: glaciers of nitrogen ice, avalanches, old traces of once-flowing rivers, volcanoes and mountain peaks some 11,000 feet tall. (The “Pluto Not Yet Explored” stamp also traveled with the spacecraft as an onboard memento, setting a Guinness World Record for the farthest distance traveled by a stamp.) New Horizons has continued phoning home data from the flyby, which ends this month. It will then continue its journey in the Kuiper Belt ― the part of the solar system beyond Neptune’s orbit ― to reach another object some 1 billion miles beyond Pluto by 2019. About 95 percent of New Horizons data is already home, and scientists have learned about some major features in the icy world. “We were very surprised to find out that Pluto is still geologically alive,” Stern said. “It has upended our ideas of how planetary geophysics works.” Pluto is so small and so far from the sun that most scientists expected it to freeze beyond any chance of creating new geology today. “Obviously that naive idea is incorrect. And Pluto proved that once and for all,” Stern said. “Now we’re back at the drawing board, trying to figure out how small planets work.” Pluto’s complexity was another surprise. Most planetary bodies in the solar system have a few major feature types. Take the moon or Mercury. They’re virtually all craters, with some mountain ranges created by cratering. Some less-typical planetary objects have five or six features. Pluto has a dozen more. “It’s just the whole package. For being so small, it’s the most complex small planet that we’ve ever seen. It’s as complex as larger planets like Mars or the Earth,” Stern said. Pluto has also uniquely engaged people. The mission’s webpage received over 2 billion views in one day. The news of the flyby was on the front page of hundreds of newspapers. Space people or scientists weren’t the only ones interested in the Pluto mission, Stern says. It became part of the social fabric and, of course, an internet phenomenon. That massive social engagement, Stern says, illustrates the mission’s inspirational power. He’s received letters and has had conversations with people after his talks and in the airport who share their fascination or tell him their kids now want to go into science and engineering.  “Hopefully, this will inspire people to do even bigger things. Because there are so many big challenges to rid the world of poverty and pollution, and to do that, it’s going to happen through technology. We need to inspire more people to go into tech careers to solve problems like these, and space exploration is one way to do that.” Now that New Horizons is off to exploring other Kuiper Belt objects, Stern is expecting many more surprises.  “You could not have predicted the amazing discoveries at Pluto, even though we have been to a couple of objects in the solar system that were at least a little analogous to Pluto,” Stern said. “We’ve never been to anything like where we are going next, either. I don’t make predictions, except to say to expect to see something wonderful.” I asked Stern what really went through his mind when he first saw there was a heart shape on Pluto. “I was in a room where the data was being displayed, hot off the press, and one of our media people said it’s heart-shaped. And I thought, ‘Oh that’s silly,’” he recalled. “But then I looked up and saw that it really did look like a heart. We knew that would make Pluto a lot more approachable to the public. I mean, who can’t like a heart?” Stern continued. “Like many aspects of this mission, the public participation was phenomenal ― and I always say, ‘Pluto did its part.’”",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

"Global Warming Won't Cut Winter Death Rates As Hoped, Study Says","By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent OSLO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Global warming will fail to reduce  high winter death rates as some officials have predicted because  there will be more harmful weather extremes even as it gets less  cold, a British study showed on Sunday. A draft U.N. report due for publication next month says  that, overall, climate change will harm human health, but adds: ""Positive effects will include modest improvements in  cold-related mortality and morbidity in some areas due to fewer  cold extremes, shifts in food production and reduced capacity of  disease-carrying vectors."" However a report in the journal Nature Climate Change on the  situation in England and Wales said climate warming would likely  not decrease winter mortality in those places. It suggested more  volatile winters, with swings from cold to mild linked to rising  greenhouse gas emissions, might even raise death rates. Lead author Philip Staddon of the University of Exeter told  Reuters that the findings were likely to apply to other  developed countries in temperate regions that risk more extreme  weather as temperatures rise. Excess winter deaths (EWDs), the number of people who die in  winter compared to other times of the year, roughly halved to  31,000 in England and Wales in 2012-12 from 60,000 typical in  the 1950s, official data show. Staddon's report said the decline was due to better home  insulation, heating, health care and other non-climate factors  with no link to a decline in the number of cold days. ""Winter cold severity no longer predicts the numbers  affected,"" the authors wrote. ""The correlation between the  number of cold winter days per year and EWDs, which was strong  until the mid-1970s, no longer exists.""                 HEATWAVES Staddon's findings are at odds with a 2012 Climate Change  Risk Assessment by the British Department for Environment, Food  and Rural Affairs (Defra) that said global warming would bring  ""some potential benefits, for example, a projected reduction in  winter mortality."" Asked to comment on Sunday's report, a Defra spokesman said  an updated climate assessment was due in 2017. ""We will continue to take account of the latest scientific  evidence,"" he said. Many governments are reviewing health spending priorities  and summer heatwaves are often seen as a bigger threat than  winter cold. U.N. studies say it is at least 95 percent probable  that most warming in recent years is man-made. Staddon said developed nations should avoid a radical shift  in spending to heatwave protection, such as better air  conditioning in homes for the elderly, from measures to ease  cold such as subsidies for insulation or winter heating. ""Heatwave deaths will increase a lot but there will still be  more winter deaths,"" he said. In 2003, the worst European  heatwave in centuries killed up to 70,000 people, including  about 3,000 in Britain.

Super Runner Semenya Faces New Testosterone Limits In Sports Gender Battle,"Running phenomenon Caster Semenya of South Africa and some other top females runners will likely have to reduce their body’s natural testosterone levels under new rules to continue to compete in top international races. The new rules issued Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations set strict limits on testosterone levels for women and “intersex” athletes in women’s races. They represent a continuing struggle over how to create fair competition amid increased sensitivity and understanding about what constitutes gender in the “binary” sports establishment.  Just as the rules were announced, a leading IAAF scientist said he predicts a third “intersex” category could be established in the next five to 10 years in international competition. For now, beginning in November, the blood testosterone level must be 5 nanomoles per liter for a continuous period of at least six months for an athlete to compete in a women’s event under the new IAAF track rules. The new levels, down from 10 nmol/L, will apply to all athletes with a “difference of sexual development” designation and will include only female or “intersex” athletes, not athletes designated as male, who would be barred from women’s competition. The levels will apply to athletes competing in international women’s events from 400 meters to the mile. The IAAF had defended its decision by saying the typical range among elite female athletes is 0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L, according to NPR. If athletes the IAAF refers to as “hyperandrogenous women” don’t lower their testosterone to the new levels, they will only be allowed to compete with men or intersex athletes under the new rules, in longer events or in lower profile, non-international races.  The IAAF’s new regulations are an attempt to avoid battles over gender by sticking to the basic math of hormone blood levels, specifically testosterone. High levels of endogenous testosterone can significantly enhance sporting performance.  “The revised rules are not about cheating. They are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe said in a statement Thursday.  “Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition ― men’s events and women’s events. This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone ... provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.”  The IAAF statement said that the new regulations are “in no way intended as any kind of judgement on or questioning of the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.” A court suspended testosterone levels set by IAAF in 2011 until the organization could prove high levels of the hormone provided an unfair edge in competition, which the IAAF says it has now done. The levels were criticized at the time as specifically targeted at Semenya, whose victories appeared to be hurt by the lowered levels. Her wins increased again when the new testosterone levels were suspended in 2015. But Dr. Stephane Bermon, head of IAFF’s health and science department, told The Guardian that the testosterone issue affects many female athletes, not just Semenya. “It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media,” Berman said. “In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.” Bermon, who foresees an intersex competitive category in the future, insisted that restricting competition based on testosterone is fair — and does not penalize a natural gift. “The reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,” Bermon said. “Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males.” Semenya, 27, who won Olympic gold in the women’s 800-meter races at London 2012 and Rio 2016, didn’t immediately respond to the announcement of the new regulations, but last year she called IAAF’s study of athletes and testosterone levels “nonsense.” She also had an angry tweet Thursday: pic.twitter.com/fic76ojjqh Semenya was ordered to undergo gender testing in 2009, the year she won the 800-meter at the World Championships in Berlin at the age of 18. The results were never publicly released, and she was cleared to compete again the following year. She complained then she had been subjected to “unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being” that “infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights.” The new IAAF rules could be challenged again in court.",SPORTS,SPORTS
People Sent A Lot Of Racist Email To UCLA After 3 Athletes Were Arrested In China,"In the days after three UCLA men’s basketball players were arrested in China for allegedly shoplifting during a November visit, emails and letters poured in to university Chancellor Gene Block from angry fans, alumni and people with no connection to the school at all. There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater.  The three players ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly: “My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.” Very much so, said another: “Don’t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !”  And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes. Many of them were clearly spurred on by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who was just then initiating a feud with LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo. HuffPost obtained the emails via a public records request, and in them the whole modern American backlash is on display. Expressions of lofty disapproval, bloodthirsty formalism, coded racism, frank racism — hey, hey, the gang’s all here. “They have embarrassed their country as well as their race,” read one note. “They put shame on UCLA, their race and our country,” read another. “3 JERKS — DISGRACED THE COLLEGE — OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR RACE!” read a third, this one a handwritten letter. The full collection of emails and letters, all 637 pages, appears at the bottom of this post. First, some background: Ball, Riley and Hill, all freshmen, were arrested on Nov. 7 during the UCLA team’s early-season trip to China to play Georgia Tech. The players, according to Chinese authorities and later by their own admissions, had stolen sunglasses and other merchandise from three department stores in Hangzhou.  On Nov. 15, Block and UCLA suspended the players indefinitely. Ball has since left the program to play professionally overseas. Hill and Riley are serving one-season suspensions.  The arrests became a national story in part because of Trump, who claimed credit for helping the players avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence in China. Some of the emails sent to Block took their cues from Trump’s version of events. “Never again should anyone be allowed to commit a crime where President Trump has to come to UCLA’s rescue. It is absolutely disgusting,” one correspondent wrote. “The man who probably stands against just about everything the UCLA community defends comes to the rescue of people who unfortunately are associated with UCLA.” ESPN has since reported that UCLA officials had resolved the issue with Chinese authorities before they heard from Trump or White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.  It was a simple case of minor theft, but from the wailing of the emails you might have thought the players had rampaged through the Forbidden City. Nothing short of the total annihilation of the young men’s academic and professional lives would suffice in the eyes of many of the emailers. The players deserved the full force of American (and perhaps even Chinese) law for having swiped and ultimately returned a few pairs of sunglasses and other merchandise. One emailer told Block to “recommend that they not be rewarded with any professional contracts.” Time and again, emailers returned to the theme that the players were “entitled” athletes who didn’t truly belong in college, especially not one as prestigious as UCLA. This racist exceptionalism ― the idea that black men can only earn their way into college through athletic talent ― flows in part from the reality of the school’s population. Black men make up only about 3 percent of the male student body at UCLA, and a majority of them are athletes. As a viral video produced by students noted, the university has had more national sports championships in its history than it had black male freshmen in 2013’s enrollment class.   In the emails, the usual racial code words were frequently deployed. The athletes were called some variation of “entitled” or “spoiled” nearly 50 times. “Stupid,” “arrogant” and “above the law” also appeared regularly. There were at least 18 uses of “thug,” as in “entitled millionaire thugs,” in 14 separate emails. The players were also labeled “ingrates,” “fucking embarrassing morons,” “miscreant prima donnas” and “reprobates.” More than a dozen times, emailers explicitly referenced their own status as “taxpayers,” as if to suggest (in one writer’s view) that they were tired of “subsidizing” athletes like Ball, Riley and Hill. And sometimes, the emailers dispensed with the racial coding altogether. One subject line: “Black Basketball Thieves.” Another message declared that what the players did was “Super-Idiocy!” It went on: “And you’re going to let these morons earn a college degree at UCLA? Looks like they fulfill the stereotype of a ‘simpleton black athlete.’” The batch of emails included one that seemed to link the players to Michael Brown, the teenager shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. “It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri.”  In the documents provided to HuffPost, UCLA appears to have redacted the players’ names and any specific identification of them, as a way of formally protecting their identities. But you don’t need a decoder ring to figure out what these passages are trying to say (sic throughout): UCLA must send a strong message on what it expects from such role models ― let’s not lie to ourselves, that’s what they are to millions of young [redacted] males. It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri. Then he gets angry when someone tries to stop him, and he charges at the cop ― and gets shot. It all starts when responsible institutions like UCLA give up on their responsibilities. Expel the thugs! Stealing designer sunglasses from Louis Vuitton in China while our president Trump is visiting is NOT who we are as a nation, but it is definitely who they are, a bunch of knuckleheads, lowlifes, thugs, and [redacted] with attitude. Why would you ever let trash like that out of the country?? It aint no big deal! No other country in the world would take the crap that we do from a minority 13% of a population for the majority of crime and other A-Z Any other minority in the US seem to be able to make it along with a moral compass. Not to excuse slavery but for decade’s now [redacted] that wants to half way follow the program will make it. Its time to not hear any more excuses and crutching! These three should not get a pass, just because of the color of their skin. If they are attending your university on scholarships I strongly suggest they loose them. They can turn to their hero Colin Kaepernick, GQ’s Citizen of the Year for help. What they did was not just stupid, it was ghetto and criminal, and we have no doubt that if there is another LA riot that they will be looting and vandalizing with their brothers. Congratulations for continuing to show China what American atheltes exist in this country. China reads about the NFL players disregard to the American Flag and police that proudly give their life everyday to protect them, to this display of disrespect of China, America and the UCLA basketball program and school. To some emailers, it was clear that the three players were experienced criminals ... I can only assume they have never been held accountable because they can shoot a ball into a basket. For these athletes to steal with the comfort level displayed showed they clearly had done this before. Pampered puss ants who probably let their trouser snakes out on campus screwing anything they see! FUCK EM!! ... and that they weren’t good enough students to be at UCLA in the first place: Two of the fellows could hardly speak english. And did you notice that your student athletes had trouble reading their prepared statements? Shame on UCLA. How did these students get into UCLA in the first place? I bet it probably wasn’t scholastics. … Dumber than a 2nd coat of paint! I am embarrassed when your student athletics, like your arrested basketball players and even last year’s player [redacted] give interviews and use the word “ain’t ”. Children at age four learn that “ain’t” is not proper grammar and unacceptable. This example simply proves you have no regard for even teaching you student-athletics basic English grammar. Stop the nonsense. It is an embarrassment to our country and your so called “education system” (what in the world are you teaching them anyway?) to have such reprobates representing us in foreign countries.  For too long California taxpayers have been subsidizing free education for questionable athletes/students. ... There needs to be more vetting of these student athletes, background checks, and general review of their understanding of civics and ethics, before California Taxpayers continue to subsidize these people. At a minimum, remove them from the basketball team. Of course this really means remove them from UCLA as they have no other use to be there since they can’t play basketball. I’m sick of paying for a full SCHOLARSHIP for future wifebeater/ drug dealing, criminal scum who get away with stuff that have a normal person in jail for 20 years, but they are “Great ballplayers”, so they get to skate free.  Some even suggested the players were indicative of everything wrong with American culture by comparing them to Harvey Weinstein and other famous people implicated in sexual harassment and assault cases: [T]hey are toxic to the school and the sport just like serial sex predator Harvey Weinstein who is now a Hollywood pariah” UCLA cannot stand by and turn a blind eye to this disgrace...it is akin to the many in the entertainment industry whom allowed Harvey Weinstein and his ilk to victimize individuals in the name of money and fame. …  I must insist - no, demand - that these disgraceful, criminal thugs be permanently expelled from UCLA for their heinous behavior and criminal acts. I’m particularly troubled by what appears to be the emerging excuse – that they’re young men, who made a very foolish mistake. To me, that’s a bit like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay when he’s charged with sexual misconduct. Look at the news; Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. The time to say enough is enough is now. For UCLA, if these young men are allowed to continue to be students there, at a time when entitlement is under such scrutiny because of the misdeeds in Washington, in Hollywood, news agencies, workplaces, academia and homes throughout the country, giving these players a pass adds insult to injury. Our moral and ethical scales are calibrated today to benefit the powerful over the ordinary. If they stay on campus, it may appear that UCLA is putting a thumb on the scale promoting star power at a time when we are at a moral crossroads. And some who emailed Block said that he and UCLA should have left the players in China to face legal proceedings and potential jail time there: I find it shameful that our President brought the thieving basketball players home. Hopefully they will go to jail in China. They rightfully deserved to be tried and punished under Chinese law. They deserve to be in a Chinese prison. Our country now owes a Communist country a favor. This is serious. This is one of the few times we have disagreed with the actions of the President. In our opinion, the young men should have received Chinese legal proceedings and suffered the consequences. Like a bubble gum chewer in China they should have been left to face a bamboo whip. Only a handful of the emails sent to Block suggested that the appropriate punishment for the petty crimes the players committed in China wasn’t to ruin their entire lives.  “Chancellor Block,” one person wrote, “Please do not give up on these young UCLA men. Stick by them & help them grow.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
2016 In Review: Top Tips from the Best Entrepreneurs in the Business,"Over the past year, I've compiled more than 150 business-building insights and actionable strategies from some of the top entrepreneurs in their respective fields--including social media market mavens, consultants to some of the world's most affluent families, and even a Hindu priest turned entrepreneur. Here are five of the top tips that have come my way--ones that I, and other top entrepreneurs like me, are now using every day to leapfrog the competition and build winning, world-class companies.   1. Focus on where you generate the most value. We've got to decide what our highest and best ability is, and devote ourselves to it. For many of us, that means being the rainmaker who brings in new business and makes important new connections--not the person who deals with the daily operations and minutia. Each year, take a step back and ask yourself: Am I focused where I should be given what I want to accomplish most? Such moments can lead to inflection points in your businesses. 2. Build a great ""front row"" of raving fans--and become one yourself. You want great people surrounding you in all aspects of your life. These will be the people who make up your ""front row""-- your biggest, most raving fans who will support you in all you do. To build that roster, start by listing the most important people and relationships in each major category of your life -- including health, business, social, religious and so on. Are you devoting enough time and energy to these key people as you should, or do you let these relationships slide? Another exercise for building a great front row of people around you is to ask yourself: Whose front row am I in? Look at your network and your friends and see who you are important to. Then ask yourself how you are doing at serving them, helping them and rooting them on.  3. Manage your energy like you manage your money. No matter how wealthy you are, you still have a finite amount of money -- and typically you stop and think before you spend or invest a bunch of cash, right? The key is to do the same thing with another finite, limited resource: your energy. Ask yourself: If I'm going to invest my energy in someone or something, are they going to do something with my energy that generate a return on my investment?  In short, treat a request for your time and energy like a business proposition. One way to do that is to only give advice with strings attached. When you give someone advice, always give them something to do--a simple action they should take based on your advice. If they ask for your help again, see if they did what you asked them to do the first time. If not, let them know you can't help them until they've taken that first step. If so, go out of your way to keep helping, as they've shown a commitment to executing on your advice.   4. Remain a lifelong learner. The desire to engage in continuous education is a hallmark of great entrepreneurs. It helps you stay on top of trends in and out of your industry that could impact your business, and allows you to meet and network with other knowledge-driven business owners who can help you ""up your game"" even more. One of the most valuable learning options is a mastermind group -- where successful business owners across multiple industries meet to discuss vision, strategies and challenges and brainstorm together to make improvements. The diversity of these groups can help you discover best practices and identify solutions that might not occur to you if you simply met with other entrepreneurs who are just like you. Often in these groups, members share their financials with each other in order to drill deep and develop detailed action plans around specific goals. Important: Join only those groups or organizations with the members and resources that can have a real impact on your success -- and that you can contribute your knowledge to as well.  5. Engage with the influencers in your niche. If you can enlist the help of influencers -- the movers and shakers among the types of clients you most want your business to serve -- you can leapfrog over the competition. Influencers can help you better understand the needs and concerns of your chosen niche and how to solve them, as well as help connect you to ideal prospective clients. That might mean, for example, going after the smartest people in the industry and forming partnerships or joint ventures with them. If you identify the people in control of key relationships and media channels and make them your partners, you'll get the first introductions to new leads and get big-time exposure in new markets. (Indeed, I recently co-authored a study of 3,500 highly successful entrepreneurs and found a high correlation between networking with influencers and superior financial results.) Give yourself the tools you need to accelerate your success like never before.

"John Kelly Has Repeatedly Referred To Trump As An ‘Idiot,’ NBC Reports","White House chief of staff John Kelly has often called President Donald Trump an “idiot” in front of aides and has portrayed himself as a “savior” who has singlehandedly rescued the country from disaster, according to an NBC News report published Monday that cited comments from eight current and former White House officials. Four of the officials said they’d personally witnessed Kelly using the disparaging term to describe Trump. “He doesn’t even understand what DACA is. He’s an idiot,” Kelly allegedly said during a meeting about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and overall immigration policy. “We’ve got to save him from himself.” In a statement Monday, Kelly dismissed the NBC story as “total BS.”  “I spend more time with the President than anyone else and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,” he said in a statement. “He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS. I am committed to the President, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.” White House Chief of Staff John Kelly calls our reporting ""total BS"" in a statement. --> pic.twitter.com/T0kpdsyliT NBC’s unnamed sources told the network that Kelly was known to “make fun” more generally at what the chief of staff saw as the president’s “lack of knowledge about policy and government.” They said Kelly has also painted himself as being the person responsible for shielding the country from Trump’s more erratic impulses.  “The strong implication being, ‘If I weren’t here we would’ve entered WWIII or the president would have been impeached,’” NBC reported that one senior White House official said of Kelly’s attitude. The chief of staff’s alleged criticisms of the president have been demoralizing to aides, the NBC sources said. They also accused Kelly of belittling women and of making troubling comments about the domestic violence accusations leveled against former staff secretary Rob Porter by that aide’s two ex-wives. Porter was forced to quit his job when the accusations were publicized. Officials told NBC that Kelly questioned aloud why Porter’s alleged victims “wouldn’t just move on.” John Kelly has told aides multiple times that women are more emotional than men, including at least once in front of Trump, four current and former officials tell NBC News. https://t.co/LltG93gcaM In Feb., John Kelly wondered aloud how much more Rob Porter would have to endure before his honor could be restored, sources tell NBC News.Kelly questioned why Porter's ex-wives wouldn't just move on based on the info he said he had about his marriages. https://t.co/LltG92YAMc Some of the officials quoted in the NBC story suggested that Kelly may resign this summer as tensions mount between him and Trump. But several White House spokespeople pushed back against the suggestion that the president and Kelly had anything less than a good working relationship and refuted the suggestion that Kelly had referred to Trump as an “idiot.” These officials told NBC that Kelly is in the Oval Office “more than anyone else.” They conceded, however, that Trump does get “frustrated” with the chief of staff at times. Stephanie Ruhle, one of the reporters behind the NBC article, defended the veracity of the story’s contents on Monday, telling Kelly in a tweet that it was people “on your team” who recounted stories of “you (not us) undermining [the president’s] credibility.” Dear John Kelly- As one of the people who worked on the story, I can tell you, it is WELL sourced.As for “smearing” the President, those on your team recount stories of you (not us) undermining his credibility. https://t.co/oTHDyj1Fif",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Verizon, Comcast Approach 21st Century Fox About Acquiring Assets","(Reuters) - Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc have both approached Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to express interest in buying Fox assets that were the subject of recent talks between Fox and Walt Disney Co, two people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. News of the approaches came the same day the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to end a 42-year-old restriction on ownership of multiple TV stations in a major market, removing a major roadblock to media company mergers. It is unclear whether Fox’s broadcast assets are part of any of the conversations. Fox shares jumped nearly 8 percent in after-hours trading. Shares of Viacom Inc and CBS Corp also rose more than 2 percent, a sign investors may see then as potential targets. Disney was in talks to buy Fox’s movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic and international assets such as the Star network in India and European pay TV provider Sky Plc , CNBC reported last week. The assets would give Comcast, the largest cable provider in the United States which bought NBCUniversal in 2011, an international distribution footprint. For Verizon, the U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier, it would provide movies and TV shows to stream to its mobile subscribers. Comcast and Verizon declined comment. Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

U.S. Olympic Committee Ignored Sexual Abuse Complaints Against Taekwondo Stars: Lawsuit,"The governing body of the United States’ Olympic teams ignored dozens of athletes’ sexual misconduct complaints against two taekwondo champions for years, according to a new lawsuit. The U.S. Olympic Committee, as well as USA Taekwondo, turned a blind eye to decades of alleged sexual abuse by brothers Steven and Jean Lopez, two of the sport’s most high-profile figures, contends a lawsuit filed Friday by four named women, as well as 44 women who have yet to be identified. The lawsuit marks the latest legal battle for the Olympic Committee, which was sued in February over its handling of misconduct claims against Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November to serial sexual abuse of his patients. Over 265 women have accused Nassar of sexual assault, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. The lawsuit accuses USOC, USA Taekwondo and the Lopez brothers of knowingly participating in human trafficking. The organizations were aware of the numerous sexual abuse complaints since 1996 but continued to allow the brothers to travel and interact with young female athletes, the plaintiffs contend. “The USOC is deeply focused on supporting, protecting and empowering the athletes we serve,” Patrick Sandusky, chief external affairs officer for the Olympic Committee, told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday. “We are aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety, and prevent and respond to abuse,” Sandusky continued. “The launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, along with a number of additional significant actions we are taking, will ensure that our athletes are better protected from these heinous acts.” USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez, 44, was banned from the sport last month following accusations that he sexually assaulted four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997. A report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport concluded Lopez had engaged in a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct” and allegedly used his authority as a coach to “groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes.” Jean’s younger brother, 39-year-old Steven Lopez, was temporarily suspended from the sport on Monday pending an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. Steven Lopez, a two-time Olympic champion, is one of USA Taekwondo’s most decorated athletes. USA Taekwondo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed Steven Lopez’s suspension. “While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters,” a representative for USA Taekwondo told HuffPost in a statement. “We will resolutely enforce this immediate suspension and any other sanction imposed by the Center,” according to the statement. “We note that this is an important part of providing a safe and nurturing environment for our athletes. Today’s decision is another example of the progress that is clearly being made in this area.” Neither Lopez brother responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Starbucks Says Anyone Can Now Sit In Its Cafes -- Even Without Buying Anything,"Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores’ restrooms, regardless of whether they’ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain’s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive. “We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,” the company said in a statement. @Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn’t ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for “trespassing” on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he’d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they’d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested ― mere minutes after they’d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe’s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Johnson also announced plans to close more than 8,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. on May 29 so workers can receive training about racial bias. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to “consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer” ― whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. The company noted, however, that law enforcement will be notified if a customer appears to pose a threat to safety. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn’t “want to become a public bathroom... we’re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key.” “We don’t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than,” Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to Bloomberg. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Spotify Declares War On Apple,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spotify confirmed on Friday that it has complained to Apple Inc after the U.S. tech giant rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones. The two companies have gone head to head in the battle for music streaming customers since Apple Music was launched in more than 100 countries last year, and Spotify said the rejection of its revised app for iPhones was causing it ""grave harm"". The complaint was in the form of a letter sent by Spotify's lawyer to Apple this week, technology website Recode reported.  The letter said Apple's rejection of the revised app raised ""serious concerns"" under competition law in the United States and Europe and the move was causing ""grave harm to Spotify and its customers"", Recode first reported on Thursday. ""It continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music,"" Recode quoted Spotify general counsel Horacio Gutierrez as saying in the letter. ""We cannot stand by as Apple uses the App Store approval process as a weapon to harm competitors,"" Gutierrez said. A Spotify spokeswoman confirmed the accuracy of the report. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Launched a decade ago, Spotify is the world's biggest paid music streaming service with about 30 million paying users in 59 markets while Apple Music has some 13 million. According to Recode, privately-owned Spotify said Apple turned down the app under ""business model rules"", and demanded the Swedish service use Apple's billing system if it wanted to ""use the app to acquire new customers and sell subscriptions"". Music streaming is a crowded business. Alphabet's Google Music and YouTube also compete with Spotify and Apple Music to attract users prepared to pay for music, as does Pandora Media Inc and rapper Jay Z's Tidal. Amazon.com Inc is also preparing a standalone streaming service, sources have told Reuters. (Reporting by Mia Shanley; editing by Alistair Scrutton and David Clarke)",TECH,TECH
An Open Letter To Brokers,"I come in peace.  I have been hard on you in the past.  At times, I was insensitive to the fact that you are husbands, wives, Moms and Dads.  You have mortgages to pay and children to educate.  You’re under pressure to generate revenue for your employer, and they’re not exactly a charitable group. All too frequently, you met your revenue goals by selling products you knew weren’t suitable for your clients.  Typically, these were high commission investments, like non-traded REITS, annuities, hedge funds, structured notes and derivatives.  The core of your investment strategy was (and likely still is) the sale of high expense ratio, actively managed mutual funds.  These funds often tacked on sales charges (called “front-end loads”), which could range from 3% to 8.5%.  When investors protested, the mutual fund industry created a “back-end load,” which penalized investors who sold prior to holding for six years.  In addition, these funds charged a 12b-1 marketing fee of about 1% a year. You’re an intelligent group.  You’ve known for a long time that this was a giant rip-off.  Your clients would likely have been far better off in a low management fee index fund from a fund family like Vanguard.  But you had bills to pay.  Your branch manager was ruthless about meeting quotas, and relatively few investors knew about the benefits of index funds. Now, everything has changed.  Over the past three years, investors have pulled $525 billion from U.S. actively managed stock funds (like the ones you’ve been selling).  Index and passive funds had inflows of $458 billion during the same period. The writing is on the wall.  We both know it.  Investors are more savvy.  They’re not falling for the shopworn pitch about your ability to time the market, pick outperforming stocks or select the next “hot” fund manager.  Your business is in jeopardy. The news isn’t all bleak.  While a door has closed, a large window has opened.  Instead of fighting against index- based investing, join it.  It’s a much more appealing position to take with investors.  You’ll be doing the right thing and impacting your clients positively. Instead of relying on your wit and guile, and ultimately deceiving your clients, you can embrace the overwhelming academic evidence supporting index-based investing.  It’s a piece of cake compared to what you have been doing. I know what you’re thinking.  How will you demonstrate your value when anyone can buy index funds directly from fund families?  How will you justify your fee? Don’t worry.  I’ve got you covered. In The Smartest Portfolio You’ll Ever Own, I provide the academic underpinnings for a “SuperSmart Portfolio”, consisting of nine ETFs and index funds.  The stock portion of this portfolio tilts towards small size and value stocks.  It optimizes the trade-off between risk and return.  It minimizes risk by including seven asset classes for stocks and two asset classes for bonds, providing broad, global diversification.  While some investors can implement this portfolio without assistance, it’s too complicated for many.  Other investors, like trustees of a trust or sponsors of a retirement plan, will be strongly inclined to retain an advisor.  You’ll be perfectly positioned to assist them. Here’s another reason why this shift to a sound, academically based investment strategy is in your best interest.  There’s been a strong trend towards managed accounts, where the primary revenue generator is the management fee.  That fee is not affected by which investments are in the portfolio.  You can do right by your clients and not sacrifice income!  it’s a win-win. Do you have an option?  Are you just going to watch your clients flee to index funds?  I’m offering you a far better choice.  You can be pro-active.  You can differentiate yourself from your colleagues who are simply hoping investors won’t figure out there’s a better way.  You’ll be offering them that way! There are hundreds of thousands of stockbrokers in the U.S.  What if only 10% of you adopted my suggestion?  Think about the number of investors whose lives you can change. Finally, reach out to me.  I’ll help you make the transition.  I mean it. I told you I came in peace.

Corruption Is Bad,"There are few genuinely uncontroversial ideas in American politics. But here is one: Corruption is bad. Another: Someone should really do something about corruption. According to a Chapman University poll released last fall, “corruption of government officials” ranks as the single most ubiquitous American fear, ahead of “polluted drinking water,” “North Korea using weapons,” and “not having enough money for the future.” Public trust in government has been mired “near historically low levels” for a decade, according to the Pew Research Center.  The parade of outrages from the Trump administration (Kellyanne Conway hawking Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt securing cheap housing from an energy lobbyist’s spouse, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney’s admission that he only took meetings from lobbyists who contributed to his congressional campaigns, etc.) have sharpened the attention Americans ― or at least, liberals ― are giving government ethics. But Trump didn’t invent the undue influence of special interests over policymaking, however innovative his administration has been. President Barack Obama’s Treasury Department deferred to big banks on its signature anti-foreclosure initiative, and Obama’s Education Department often prioritized the interests of student loan contractors over students. And yet there is almost no energy anywhere in Washington devoted to either studying or overcoming the subtle and not-so-subtle manifestations of corruption in American political life. Entire think tanks are devoted to tax policy, foreign policy, world peace, human rights, libertarianism, and whatever Google wants ― but anti-corruption work is generally relegated to a few scholars recycling the same ideas about campaign finance reform that have been floating around for decades. Even think tanks that specialize in international corruption create the impression that it’s predominantly a problem that exists overseas. This paucity of serious work is not an accident. Think tanks themselves are meant to influence the political process, and think tanks have to get their funding somewhere. Some of the worst Washington corruption scandals in recent years have involved think tanks leveraging their reputations to help corporate donors. So the latest policy proposal from the liberal-leaning Roosevelt Institute deserves special attention. Authored by incoming federal trade commissioner Rohit Chopra as he awaited Senate confirmation for his new post, the paper marks the first comprehensive attempt to rethink federal anti-corruption policy in years ― maybe since the Watergate era. Instead of focusing on campaign contributions and elections, Chopra takes a look at the way special interests exercise undue influence over the federal bureaucracy and the broader policy debate in Washington. “We can’t just address money in politics,” Chopra told HuffPost. “We have to address money in government.” Most of the anti-corruption infrastructure in Washington was created in response to the Watergate scandals. Chopra thinks that infrastructure is too diffuse, weak and compromised by the chains of command that discourage serious oversight. The Office of Government Ethics was established in 1979, but can’t bring either civil or criminal enforcement actions for misconduct. Almost every federal agency has an independent inspector general’s office to investigate various improprieties. But IGs are appointed by the president, and most presidents aren’t terribly eager to unearth problems in their own administrations. “Good IGs are few and far between,” Chopra says.   In the Roosevelt paper, he proposes the creation of a new Public Integrity Protection Agency, or PIPA, to centralize and streamline the anti-corruption oversight that is currently dispersed throughout the federal bureaucracy. It’s an idea similar to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ― where Chopra previously served as an assistant director ― which consolidated the regulatory power previously spread across five different federal financial regulators.  Like other federal regulators, the PIPA would be empowered to bring enforcement actions in federal court, to issue fines against agencies or individuals and to remove rogue employees from government. “We’ve long known that government agencies can be captured by corporations and special interests,” says Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog. “This particular paper is an important contribution, and other efforts are coalescing across the country as people try to figure out what can be accomplished in a bipartisan manner.” The new PIPA wouldn’t just be responsible for policing the bureaucracy. It would also have jurisdiction over think tanks, advocacy groups and other organizations that seek to influence the political process. The PIPA could propose and enforce new rules on funding disclosure, making clear to lawmakers, regulators and the public when organizations are speaking on behalf of particular donors.  Chopra would also empower the PIPA to “slow down” the revolving door between regulated industries and the agencies that regulate them, imposing new restrictions on officials who enter or leave public office. The specifics would be up to the agency, but the idea would be to prevent someone from, say, leaving a big bank to become a bank regulator and write weak rules.  “Since the 1970s, corporations have become more sophisticated about spending money in ways that are not considered lobbying,” notes Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, another liberal-leaning think tank. “That includes hiring people who are coming out of government and relying on their social networks as assets.” Insulating PIPA itself from partisan pressures would be an obvious priority, since the agency would exercise tremendous power over the executive branch. Chopra suggests having a director appointed for a lengthy term ― seven to 10 years ― and being selected through a process that involves all three branches of the federal government. The Supreme Court could present a slate of potential nominees to the president, who would select a director who would then be subject to Senate confirmation. The scope of PIPA’s regulatory authority would also be tailored to the First Amendment ― big donors would still be able to give freely to think tanks and other organizations, and working at a bank couldn’t be a lifetime ban on government service. But plenty of activities would still be eligible for oversight, from think tank funding disclosures to stock trading by federal employees. “There is a lot more money spent on influence than official statistics on lobbying reveal,” Chopra says. “When I was at the Education Department, I saw firsthand how government contractors seemed to be calling the shots.” None of these ideas are going to be implemented anytime soon. As campaign finance reform advocates can attest, it’s hard to convince members of Congress to reform a system that put them in power. And even anti-corruption experts are reluctant to criticize the existing system under the current administration, lest they undermine the few IGs that are actually doing good work.  But Washington seems to be changing. In the past few weeks, multiple senators have endorsed ambitious policy ideas that seemed unthinkable just a few years or even months ago. The Roosevelt Institute paper could be the start of a new conversation about clean government. “We need to revisit government institutions broadly to make clear that not only is Donald Trump’s corruption unacceptable, but the type of banal corruption that predated him is also unacceptable,” Hauser told HuffPost.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Canada's Ice Hockey Team Crushes OAR To Set Up U.S. Showdown At Winter Olympics,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea - Canada thumped the Olympic Athletes from Russia 5-0 on Monday to book their spot in the Olympic women’s ice hockey final and renew one of the Winter Games’s greatest rivalries. Canada have played for gold at every Winter Games since women’s hockey became part of the Olympic program in 1998 and for the fifth time in six Winter Games will face off against the United States. “We have something special here and we’re ready our coaching staff has prepared us as best they can and we just need to go out and just play,” Canada forward Meghan Agosta told reporters. “This is something we have worked hard for all year and it comes down to one game and it is going to be the better team that comes out on top and there is no doubt in my mind that we are going to be ready for whatever it takes.” The U.S. set the stage for a rematch when they shutout Finland 5-0 to reach the final for the third consecutive Olympics. Although the U.S. and Canada have met on every final except at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the Americans have not had gold hung around their necks since the Nagano Games with the Canadians occupying top spot on the podium ever since. On a day when International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene Fasel announced the Olympic tournament at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games would expand from eight to 10 teams, Canada and U.S. continued to show they remain a class apart. Canada wasted no time getting on the scoreboard as they connected on their first shot, Natalie Spooner digging the puck out of the corner and feeding an unmarked Jennifer Wakefield, who slammed it past Valeria Tarakanova 1:50 into the opening period. The defending champions dominated large stretches of play put could not put another puck by Tarakanova until Marie-Philip Poulin beat the OAR netminder with a neat backhand five minutes into the second. After two gritty periods the OAR finally succumbed to Canadian pressure in the third when Wakefield collected her second of night and Emily Clark added another 31 seconds later, chasing Tarakanova from the game in favor of Nadezhda Alexandrova. “I’m just excited to kind of get the monkey off my back a little bit,” Wakefield said. “We’re just excited to play them (U.S.). “We have the rivalry, it’s well-documented and we’re just looking forward to the opportunity to bring home another gold.” Rebecca Johnston closed out the scoring by banging home a loose puck from a scramble in front of the Russian net. Shannon Szabados was not overworked but turned in a rock- solid effort in the Canadian net, making 14 saves for the shutout.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Facebook And Google Have New Weapons In Place To Block Extremist Videos,"Some of the web’s biggest destinations for watching videos have quietly started using automation to remove extremist content from their sites, according to two people familiar with the process. The move is a major step forward for internet companies that are eager to eradicate violent propaganda from their sites and are under pressure to do so from governments around the world as attacks by extremists proliferate, from Syria to Belgium and the United States. YouTube and Facebook are among the sites deploying systems to block or rapidly take down Islamic State videos and other similar material, the sources said. The technology was originally developed to identify and remove copyright-protected content on video sites. It looks for ""hashes,"" a type of unique digital fingerprint that internet companies automatically assign to specific videos, allowing all content with matching fingerprints to be removed rapidly. Such a system would catch attempts to repost content already identified as unacceptable, but would not automatically block videos that have not been seen before. The companies would not confirm that they are using the method or talk about how it might be employed, but numerous people familiar with the technology said that posted videos could be checked against a database of banned content to identify new postings of, say, a beheading or a lecture inciting violence. The two sources would not discuss how much human work goes into reviewing videos identified as matches or near-matches by the technology. They also would not say how videos in the databases were initially identified as extremist. Use of the new technology is likely to be refined over time as internet companies continue to discuss the issue internally and with competitors and other interested parties.  In late April, amid pressure from U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. and European leaders concerned about online radicalization, internet companies including Alphabet Inc's YouTube, Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and CloudFlare held a call to discuss options, including a content-blocking system put forward by the private Counter Extremism Project, according to one person on the call and three who were briefed on what was discussed. The discussions underscored the central but difficult role some of the world's most influential companies now play in addressing issues such as terrorism, free speech and the lines between government and corporate authority. None of the companies at this point has embraced the anti-extremist group's system, and they have typically been wary of outside intervention in how their sites should be policed. “It’s a little bit different than copyright or child pornography, where things are very clearly illegal,” said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. Extremist content exists on a spectrum, Hughes said, and different web companies draw the line in different places. Most have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates their terms of service, and many still do. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. The companies now using automation are not publicly discussing it, two sources said, in part out of concern that terrorists might learn how to manipulate their systems or that repressive regimes might insist the technology be used to censor opponents. ""There's no upside in these companies talking about it,” said Matthew Prince, chief executive of content distribution company CloudFlare. “Why would they brag about censorship?”  The two people familiar with the still-evolving industry practice confirmed it to Reuters after the Counter Extremism Project publicly described its content-blocking system for the first time last week and urged the big internet companies to adopt it. The April call was led by Facebook's head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, sources with knowledge of the call said. On it, Facebook presented options for discussion, according to one participant, including the one proposed by the non-profit Counter Extremism Project. The anti-extremism group was founded by, among others, Frances Townsend, who advised former president George W. Bush on homeland security, and Mark Wallace, who was deputy campaign manager for the Bush 2004 re-election campaign.  Three sources with knowledge of the April call said that companies expressed wariness of letting an outside group decide what defined unacceptable content. Other alternatives raised on the call included establishing a new industry-controlled nonprofit or expanding an existing industry-controlled nonprofit. All the options discussed involved hashing technology. The model for an industry-funded organization might be the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which identifies known child pornography images using a system known as PhotoDNA. The system is licensed for free by Microsoft Corp. Microsoft announced in May it was providing funding and technical support to Dartmouth College computer scientist Hany Farid, who works with the Counter Extremism Project and helped develop PhotoDNA, ""to develop a technology to help stakeholders identify copies of patently terrorist content."" Facebook’s Bickert agreed with some of the concerns voiced during the call about the Counter Extremism Project's proposal, two people familiar with the events said. She declined to comment publicly on the call or on Facebook's efforts, except to note in a statement that Facebook is “exploring with others in industry ways we can collaboratively work to remove content that violates our policies against terrorism.” In recent weeks, one source said, Facebook has sent out a survey to other companies soliciting their opinions on different options for industry collaboration on the issue. William Fitzgerald, a spokesman for Alphabet's Google unit, which owns YouTube, also declined to comment on the call or about the company's automated efforts to police content. A Twitter spokesman said the company was still evaluating the Counter Extremism Project's proposal and had ""not yet taken a position."" A former Google employee said people there had long debated what else besides thwarting copyright violations or sharing revenue with creators the company should do with its Content ID system. Google's system for content-matching is older and far more sophisticated than Facebook's, according to people familiar with both. Lisa Monaco, senior adviser to the U.S. president on counterterrorism, said in a statement that the White House welcomed initiatives that seek to help companies “better respond to the threat posed by terrorists’ activities online.

"Georgia Aquarium's Beluga Request Rejected By U.S., Drawing Praise From Animal Advocates","From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon: The Obama administration threw cold water on the world's largest aquarium this week, rejecting its proposal to buy 18 beluga whales from Russia. It was the first attempt in more than 20 years to import marine mammals recently captured from the wild.

The decision, which is drawing praise from many animal advocates, comes at a turbulent time for marine theme parks. Already beset by criticism since an orca killed a SeaWorld trainer in 2010, the industry is now waging a public relations battle against unflattering portrayals like the new film ""Blackfish"" and the book ""Death at SeaWorld."" While much of that controversy focuses on orcas' danger to humans, it has also revived a longstanding debate about keeping such social, intelligent mammals in pens for public display.

The Georgia Aquarium wanted to import 18 Russian belugas for display in Atlanta and at several partner facilities, including three SeaWorld parks and Chicago's Shedd Aquarium. While captive belugas present different issues than captive orcas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration still deemed the Georgia Aquarium's proposal too ecologically murky. Federal law allows wild cetaceans to be captured or imported for public display, but also imposes limits designed to protect vulnerable species.

""The Georgia Aquarium clearly worked hard to follow the required process and submit a thorough application, and we appreciate their patience and cooperation as we carefully considered this case,"" NOAA's Sam Rauch says in a statement. ""However, under the strict criteria of the law, we were unable to determine if the import of these belugas, combined with the active capture operation in Russia and other human activities, would have an adverse impact on this stock of wild beluga whales.""

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service offers three reasons for declining the request: The belugas in question were captured from Russia's Sea of Okhotsk between 2006 and 2011, according to NOAA, and currently live at Utrish Marine Mammal Research Station on the Black Sea Coast. While scientific data about the size and stability of this beluga population are spotty, the agency notes that belugas in general are not well-suited to captivity, and their species is vulnerable to an array of manmade dangers.

""Beluga whales are social animals that typically migrate, hunt and interact together in groups of ten to several hundred in the arctic and subarctic waters of Russia, Greenland and North America,"" NOAA explains. ""Beluga whales face a number of threats including ship strikes, pollution, habitat destruction and entanglement in fishing gear.""

In a statement emailed to MNN Wednesday afternoon, the Georgia Aquarium calls NOAA's decision ""deeply disappointing."" It argues the proposal was not only in full accordance with U.S. and international laws, but would also ""help ensure the sustainability of beluga whales in human care"" at its facility and others throughout North America.

""Sadly, the decision places the long-term global sustainability of an entire species in limbo,"" writes spokeswoman Meghann Gibbons. ""Throughout this process, we have worked closely with NMFS, and we plan to continue pursuing what options are available to us under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to ensure the ongoing survival of beluga whales.""

The aquarium has 60 days to appeal the ruling in U.S. District Court, and its statement suggests it sees legal justification for pushback. ""We strongly believe our application presented extensive, research-based evidence which met all requirements of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act under federal law,"" Gibbons writes, ""and illustrated the critical importance of these belugas to ensuring a future for the species globally, while having no detrimental impact on the population of their origin in Russia.""

Two belugas have died at the Georgia Aquarium in recent years, along with two whale sharks, prompting some animal-rights advocates to view any expansion plans with suspicion. NOAA received nearly 9,000 comments during the proposal's 60-day comment period last year, many of which expressed doubt about the well-being of captive belugas. (The Georgia Aquarium later issued a lengthy response to a wide range of critiques.)

Activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has gone even further, arguing marine parks and aquaria violate the 13th Amendment by enslaving whales. A federal judge threw out a PETA lawsuit against SeaWorld last year, however, ruling that whales don't have the same constitutional rights as humans. ""The only reasonable interpretation of the 13th Amendment's plain language is that it applies to persons, and not to non-persons such as orcas,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller.

But aside from the ethical implications of keeping intelligent, migratory whales in captivity, NOAA's ruling suggests the capture of wild belugas — which Russia has been doing for more than 20 years — could pile too much pressure onto an already-vulnerable marine mammal. ""The ongoing live-capture trade since 1989 may have contributed to a cumulative decline over the past two decades,"" the agency writes, ""and we considered this in combination with other past, present, and foreseeable future actions.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Business Groups Might Be Quietly Killing A Bill That Would Bring Sexual Abuse Claims To Light,"WASHINGTON — After widespread public criticism of its sexual harassment policies, Uber this week announced that it would end its practice of forcing individual sexual harassment accusers into private arbitration. It’s among a small handful of companies who have taken a stand against the legal mechanism, which can effectively silence victims of sexual harassment and assault by giving employers disproportionate power. Shortly after, its ride-sharing rival Lyft announced a similar policy, joining Microsoft, the first major company to ban the practice back in December. Congress could make all companies follow suit and allow individuals to take sexual harassment cases against employers to court. In December, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation in the House and Senate that would ban employers across the board from applying forced arbitration in cases involving workplace sexual harassment.  The legislation boasted a bipartisan group of co-sponsors, and it had a boost from former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, whose contract contained a forced arbitration clause when she leveled sexual harassment claims against executives at the cable news giant. Despite increased attention on the issue because of the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, the legislation appears to have stalled, with both bills referred to legislative committees nearly six months ago. Some of its advocates suspect that it’s due to lobbying and pushback from business leaders who don’t want to publicly declare that they are against the legislation — and in effect, say they support silencing sexual misconduct victims. In a Tuesday statement, Bustos heralded Uber’s decision as “proof that our movement is making a difference.” She renewed her calls for Republican leaders to move forward on the bills, accusing them of “being lobbied aggressively by special interests who are on the wrong side of history.”  Among the several businesses and groups that have reported lobbying activity on the legislation, Microsoft is the only company to publicly back the bills, after the company’s president met with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the Senate bill’s co-sponsors. During a press conference introducing the legislation in December, Graham called on business leaders and groups like chambers of commerce to lend their support, arguing that it was good for their interests. However, when HuffPost contacted the other organizations that have disclosed lobbying related to the bill, two of them — the National Retail Federation and the Society of Human Resources Management — confirmed that they oppose the bill. Others said that they do not have an official position on the bill, but have favored arbitration in the past. When asked about its lobbying, the National Retail Federation said it has been “working to educate members of Congress on how arbitration agreements serve the interests of both workers and employers by avoiding lengthy, costly litigation and ensuring a fair and fast process for resolving workplace disputes,” according to a statement from Lizzy Simmons, NRF’s vice president for government relations. “Arbitration also offers an added virtue of occasionally settling these disputes with less rancor than a lawsuit.” A spokeswoman for SHRM wrote in an email that the group “supports public-policy proposals that promote an accessible, prompt and fair resolution of harassment claims in the workplace while protecting confidentiality and due process, including in arbitration.” Lauren Sheets Jarrell, chief counsel at the American Tort Reform Association, said in an email that “we generally support arbitration as an efficient tool for judicial economy.” When asked about the group’s lobbying, she said that it had not taken a position on the bill. “We’re taking a look at these pieces of legislation and discussing them with our members. The Chamber will work with anyone to make sure appropriate steps are taken to combat sexual harassment,” a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said.  In the past, the Chamber has opposed other efforts to restrict forced arbitration. Earlier this year, Facebook, which also has reported lobbying activity, said that it was considering its position on the bill. A company spokeswoman said Thursday that there were no updates. Uber, which is not among the companies that have reported lobbying activity, said Tuesday it supports the bill. Both bills were referred to their corresponding committees and subcommittees, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  A spokeswoman for the House subcommittee’s GOP vice chair, Rep. John Ratcliffe (Texas), said that there were no updates on the status of the bill. A spokeswoman for subcommittee chair Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) did not return multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for HELP committee chair Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) did not immediately return a request for comment on any updates on the bill. Advocates for the legislation suggested that the relative lack of public support from companies and interest groups are the reason for the bill stalling and argued that their apparent reluctance to state a position shows that they may not want to publicly say that they are against it. “Publicly, everybody will tell you, we support women’s rights, we support the rights of rape survivors, but privately, companies are lobbying against the bill,” said Julia Duncan, senior director of government affairs at the American Association for Justice, one group that has lobbied in favor of the bill. “I think if companies are unwilling to support a sexual harassment survivor or sexual assault survivor’s right to file a claim in open court, they should say so.” Duncan argued that congressional action is necessary because it’s not enough to put the onus on individual companies like Uber to reform their practices. “Uber can say, ‘Yes, I will face these nine women in court for these claims,’ and tomorrow, they could reverse their position and say, ‘Everybody else goes to forced arbitration.’ There’s nothing in the law that says they can’t do that,” she said. “The vast majority of companies will continue to force people into arbitration, no matter how bad it makes them look.”",POLITICS,BUSINESS

What To Know About The Iran Nuclear Deal,"President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the U.S. will withdraw from the international nuclear accord with Iran, the landmark 2015 agreement curbing Iran’s nuclear development program in return for sanctions relief.  By ending America’s participation in the deal, Trump fulfills a major campaign promise. But the decision could set the stage for an international political crisis and uncertainty over the future of Iran’s nuclear program. Here’s what you need to know about the agreement:  Also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal is the result of a decade of international negotiations to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Although Iran is banned from possessing nuclear weapons as a state party of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it failed to disclose the existence of its uranium-enrichment program for 18 years, causing alarm when its clandestine program was revealed in 2003. Negotiators from Iran and six other world powers, including the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, reached the historic agreement on July 14, 2015. It placed strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear program that were set to last for more than a decade.  The United Nations Security Council endorsed the deal on July 20, 2015, officially agreeing to “terminate” U.N. sanctions on Iran. The JCPOA was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” then-President Barack Obama said at the time it was agreed. “This is our best bet by far to make sure Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon,” Obama added. Tehran had always maintained that its nuclear development was only intended for energy and other peaceful purposes, but fears the Islamic Republic was working on developing a nuclear bomb had been rising in the West. Critics of the agreement, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, argued that the deal at its core was not tough enough on Iran. “Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that [Iran builds] illicitly,” Netanyahu said in 2015. “Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium. That’s a very bad deal.” Trump has echoed these concerns, repeatedly calling it “the worst deal ever.” At its most basic level, the deal meant Iran agreed to put heavy restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for world powers lifting economic sanctions that target the country. The deal lasts until 2030, with some restrictions expiring before then and other inspection measures extending years beyond that date.  Prior to the agreement, international sanctions and trade embargoes had cost the Iranian economy tens of billions of dollars.  Iran stood to benefit from a potential increase in foreign investment and access to the Swift international banking system. In return, the rest of the parties to the agreement believed they had security that Iran was always at least a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon during the time that the deal was enforced. Under the terms of the deal, Iran agreed to remove or reduce many of the components needed to create nuclear weapons. The country accepted a 98 percent reduction of its uranium stockpile, the removal of a reactor core used to make plutonium at the Arak heavy water plant and the reduction of thousands of centrifuges needed to enrich uranium. Iran also agreed to limit its research and development work, as well as several other restrictions. The deal contained strict rules on monitoring and inspection of Iran’s nuclear sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency was required to extensively monitor Iran’s nuclear facilities, and IAEA workers had access to a live video stream of areas including Iranian uranium enrichment plants. Inspectors also have wide-ranging access to sites within the country that they deem necessary to investigate. While conducting this monitoring and inspection regime, the IAEA confirmed nine times that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. The Consequences Of Scrapping The Deal In the immediate aftermath of Trump’s announcement, European and Iranian officials condemned the U.S. decision and vowed to pursue separate negotiations to continue the nuclear deal. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on signatories to the deal to maintain their commitments despite the U.S. violation. But if the Iran nuclear deal eventually falls apart as a result of Trump’s decision to pull out of the agreement, there are several potential outcomes. The U.S. and other world powers could attempt to negotiate a new deal with Iran on terms that Trump finds more favorable. French President Emmanuel Macron has floated the prospect of a new deal that would entail renegotiating certain aspects of the current agreement. But Iran has rejected the prospect of a new deal, and experts say that Iran will have little incentive to enter into a future agreement if the JCPOA is ignored. Europe could also try to find a way to preserve elements of the deal and work around U.S. sanctions, something which Iran has signaled it is open to, but analysts say that is diplomatically risky and technically difficult. In this scenario, the European Union would take legal measures to shield European companies that do business with Iran from incurring U.S. sanctions. If there is no way to work around the deal, renewed economic sanctions on Iran would dry up foreign investment from the country.  Iran could choose to once again begin developing its nuclear capabilities. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is already under pressure from hardliners who have tried to undermine the deal, and he said following Trump’s speech that Iran could begin enriching uranium again if talks fail.  If Iran restarts its nuclear program, it would put the country back on the path to conflict with the U.S., Israel and possibly other Western powers.

Amazon Sued For Allegedly Selling Defective Eclipse Glasses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com has been hit with a proposed class action lawsuit by a couple who claims defective eclipse glasses purchased through the online retailer damaged their eyes. In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in South Carolina on Tuesday evening, Corey Payne and his fiancée, Kayla Harris, said they purchased a three-pack of eclipse glasses on Amazon in early August, assuming that the glasses would allow them to safely view the United States’ first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in a century on Aug. 21. Later that day, Payne and Harris began to experience headaches and eye watering. In the following days, they developed vision impairment, including blurriness and distorted vision, their lawsuit said. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The couple said they did not look into the sky without wearing the glasses when they viewed the eclipse. Starting on August 10, Amazon said it began to email customers to issue a recall of potentially hazardous solar eclipse glasses it was unable to verify as having been manufactured by reputable companies. Amazon did not disclose the scale of the recall or a list of affected vendors. Payne and Harris said they did not receive notice of the recall. They are seeking to represent other customers who never received a warning from Amazon and suffered similar injuries from the company’s alleged negligence. Experts cautioned the public to steer clear of unsafe counterfeits flooding the United States in the runup to the event. While no data exists for how many eclipse glasses were in circulation overall, shady distributors of purportedly solar-safe shades abound on the Internet, experts said.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Warsaw to World Leaders: You Have Your Work Cut Out for You,"The negotiations in Warsaw, Poland have just wrapped up. World leaders have their work cut out for them, but the path is clear. Key countries must outline their proposed new emissions target for the period after 2020 before early 2015. They must come prepared to mobilize even more investment in climate action and adaptation in the developing world. And they must act aggressively now. This meeting clearly signaled that world leaders have their work cut out for them. As I said in my final statement: “World leaders better get their act together quickly. If they show up empty-handed in 2015 and don’t secure a strong international agreement, they’ll be known as the generation that clearly saw the growing threat of global climate change, and failed to try to stop it.” There is already ample evidence that humanity isn't acting quickly enough to address climate change. The need for greater action in 2015 is obvious. And there are plenty of reasons to believe that countries can get their act together by then. World leaders have a clear political signal on three key issues that are quite obvious here in Warsaw: (1) detail their next emissions reduction commitments by early 2015 at the latest; (2) increase financial investments in developing countries to reduce emissions and help address the impacts of climate change; and (3) implement additional actions right now. Detail their next emissions reduction commitments. Countries accounting for over 80 percent of the world’s emissions already have specific commitments to reduce their emissions. This was an important step that is helping drive action on the ground in key countries. Those targets covered action through 2020 so there is a need to extend those targets for a longer period – most discussion is focused on a 2025 and a 2030 timeframe. And there is need to deepen those commitments as there clear signs that even greater action must follow. The climate conference in Paris will be the next evolution of those commitments — ""targets 2.0"". In Warsaw, countries agreed to have their proposed emissions reduction commitment detailed well in advance of the Paris climate summit – in the text these proposed commitments are characterized as “intended nationally determined contributions”. Countries agreed that these commitments would need to be communicated by early 2015 at the latest.  The text refers to this agreement by stating that countries are to: “communicate them well in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so).” These proposals must include all the critical elements to ensure that we can understand them, analyze them, and urge greater action if they fall short – the “full sunset clause”. Specifically the agreement states that these proposed commitments are to be communicated: “in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended contributions.” It is clear that when world leaders meet at the 2014 Climate Summit in New York – scheduled for September 23 – they will have to encourage each other to make their proposed commitments no later than early 2015. So they’ll have to look at each other in the eye and get personal commitments that their countries will propose a new climate commitments by a specific date. There needs to be enough time to evaluate each proposal and push countries that have clearly low-balled their proposals. Increase financial investments in developing countries to reduce emissions and help address the impacts of climate change. Developed countries invested more than $10 billion per year in international climate actions between 2010 and 2012. This is an important down payment, but there is a clear recognition that more needs to be delivered. Countries agreed at the 2009 Climate Summit in Copenhagen to scale up resources to $100 billion per year for climate investments in developing countries. In Warsaw some countries outlined details on their continued commitment to support developing countries, including an injection of $100 million to support the “Adaptation Fund” as the small-island states, African countries, and others called for before the meeting. And the U.K. joined the growing group of countries that are signaling that they’ll stop using public funding to support overseas coal projects – this frees up a bunch of money that could be better used in battling climate change. A lot more work is needed on financing in the coming months. There is a growing frustration amongst key countries in Africa and the small-island states that developed countries aren’t serious about this commitment. The U.S., E.U., and many others must rebuild some trust that has been lost. These countries better come to New York, Lima (where the next climate negotiation will occur), and Paris with clear commitments, real programs, and new injections of resources. They must be creative, flexible, and serious as they scale-up resources to help developing countries deploy clean energy, address deforestation, and help the most vulnerable countries adapt to climate change Implement additional actions right now. Countries can’t wait until 2020 to take even greater action. They must act urgently at home to meet their commitments by making the necessary policy changes in their domestic context. And they should seize the near-term opportunities to commit to phase-down the “super greenhouse gas” called HFCs, phase-out public financing of overseas coal investments, double-down on clean energy, and many more actions. Significant progress wasn’t made on those issues in Warsaw, but our toolbox is bigger than the two-week climate negotiations. Countries will meet intensively in bilateral and multilateral forums to discuss phasing-down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. We hope that Japan, Germany, and South Korea will commit to phase-out overseas coal lending. And more countries must act domestically on renewables like Chile recently did when it adopted a law to significantly increase its renewable generation. Unfortunately, Japan and Australia have signaled that they will dramatically weaken their commitments. This is a disappointing step that is being roundly criticized by governments around the world and added a bad dynamic to these negotiations. And in Warsaw countries agreed to last set of details on the “transparency and accountability” provisions from the Cancun Agreements. World leaders shouldn’t wait until Paris. They should start taking action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change. Then, when they meet next year in September, they must demonstrate they are prepared to make further commitments to reduce emissions and mobilize finance to support action in developing countries. They must do so because climate change is the greatest environmental ill of our time. The world community is obligated to act to protect our children and future generations from its ravages. ------------------ Photo: Final “scrum” of key negotiators in Warsaw Saturday afternoon, courtesy of Jake Schmidt.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
This Super-Smart Bus Drives Itself,"One day, your bus to work will know when you have time for coffee and when you don't -- or so IBM and Local Motors would have you believe. The two companies debuted a new self-driving electric vehicle called the ""Olli"" in National Harbor, Maryland Thursday. The car -- really, a small bus -- is capable of transporting 12 people at once. Because it uses IBM's ""Watson"" system, pulling vast amounts of data on its surroundings from a variety of sources, the vehicle is smart enough to answer questions from passengers and learn from its environment. For example, if you use the car enough it could eventually figure out your general path to work every morning. If you're running late one day -- or Watson uses weather data to figure out that it's about to rain, or that traffic will get worse -- Olli might tell you there's no time for Starbucks. Ask it when you'll arrive at your destination and it can answer. The vehicle will be available to the public in National Harbor at ""select times"" this summer, beginning Thursday, according to the company's press release. Later this year, it will be deployed in Florida's Miami-Dade County and Las Vegas. In a sense, this one car tells you just about everything you need to know about the future of driving. Experts say the status quo of individual car ownership will become untenable as, globally, more people enter the middle class and move to urban centers. As a replacement, shared vehicles that are smart enough to find efficient routes and get passengers close to their destinations could cut down on congestion and help the environment. ""The revolution is here,"" Jay Rogers, CEO of Local Motors, a small experimental car maker, told The Huffington Post. ""It's unsustainable putting this many vehicles on the road.""  Much has been said about Google's driverless car prototype -- but Rogers says there's a problem with the tech giant's business model. ""Google doesn't make cars,"" he explained. While that's not strictly true -- the company does have its own self-driving car prototype -- Google is working with traditional automakers like Fiat Chrysler to get its vehicles on public roads. But driverless cars aren't legal in every state, which might limit the resources auto giants devote to them. ""A company like Chrysler won't put out vehicles they can't sell everywhere,"" Rogers said. He believes Local Motors is nimble enough to be an industry leader. The company designed the Olli in 2015 and officially greenlit the project this March. Now, with IBM, they have a working vehicle in Maryland. We're a ways away from having Ollis everywhere, of course, but Rogers says Local Motors' major impediment is legislation, not technology: They’re already equipped to manufacture and deliver the cars wherever there's demand -- though it's a small company, so don't expect fleets of them. As for IBM, Olli gives the company an opportunity to develop Watson and disrupt your miserable commute. The car of the future is constantly communicating with the internet, gathering information about weather, traffic -- and maybe even a passenger's health. ""[We want to] understand if people are feeling tense in a vehicle because of traffic or other things,"" Bret Greenstein, the vice president of IBM's ""internet of things"" division, told HuffPost. ""Can we change the lighting? I'm not saying this is what we're doing now, but it's where we're going.""",TECH,TECH
Cecile Richards On Running For Office In The Future: 'Never Say Never',"Running for political office is not out of the question for Cecile Richards. “Never say never, right?” the former Planned Parenthood president recently told Refinery29.  Richards, 60, served as the women’s health organization’s president since 2006 and announced she was stepping down in January. The lifelong feminist activist and organizer published her first book in April, titled Make Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead-My Life Story.  “Don’t box yourself out,” she told the publication. “I think as women, we need to have more tapes in our head that say, ‘You know, I could do that.’ And so, I never want to say there’s something I’m not going to do. There’s no reason to foreclose things.” While Richards has vowed to stay engaged in activism and political organizing, she has yet to elaborate on the details her future plans hold.   “Helping other people organize ... to hold people in office accountable for issues that matter, that brings me real joy,” she said. “I’ve seen the power of people organizing together ... and there’s a role for that that’s as important as having good people in office.”  When Richards announced she was leaving Planned Parenthood earlier this year, she said that leading the organization “has been the honor of my lifetime.” “Together, we have made real progress in this country, expanding access to services and making reproductive rights a central priority of our nation’s health care system,” she said in a statement. “I’ve been an activist my entire life — and that won’t stop any time soon.” ",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Trustee Defends MSU President, Dismissing Sex Abuse Reports As ‘Nassar Thing’","The vice chairman for Michigan State University’s board of trustees appeared to dismiss the damning Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal on Monday while defending the school’s president against calls to resign. During an interview with Michigan radio show “Staudt on Sports,” trustee Joel Ferguson insisted that university president Lou Anna Simon was “the best president [MSU’s] ever had” and would not be leaving her post. “She’s a fighter. Her overall, what she’s done for this university, she’s not going to get run out of there by what somebody else did,” he said. Ferguson expressed the board’s support for Simon despite revelations that the school allowed Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, to treat patients even while he was being investigated by university police for sexual assault. Nassar is serving a 60-year sentence on federal child pornography charges. In November, he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Ferguson said that trustees met for a five-hour meeting, yet spent only 10 minutes talking about Simon. “We had so many other things we were going over, we unanimously decided in that meeting right away ... we were going to support her staying as the president,” Ferguson said. “There’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing.” Hours after Ferguson’s radio interview, the NCAA announced it would be launching a formal investigation into the university’s handling of the allegations against Nassar. Many were outraged that Ferguson appeared to dismiss the Nassar scandal. Michigan St. trustee Joel Ferguson says Lou Anna Simon is best prez school's had in his 30 yrs on board.""So much more going on at university than this 'Nassar thing.'""""Nassar thing?"" Can you possibly be more tone deaf? Could this be one of the most tone-deaf statements ever made? Certainly in top 10: MSU Trustee on dismissing MSU Pres.  ""There’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing."" https://t.co/eDrzMQNlvE ""This Nassar thing"" is tragic. Which is why Michigan State is in desperate need of leadership. https://t.co/nVOyZkhqcv Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling him to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse. Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, the Detroit News reported last week.  The women say their warnings go back as far back as 1997, though Simon told Detroit News that she learned about Nassar’s abuse in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed. The university didn’t officially fire Nassar until two years later, in September 2016. “I was informed that a sports medicine doctor was under investigation,” Simon told Detroit News on Wednesday. “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth.”  A post shared by The State News (@statenews) on Jan 18, 2018 at 7:47am PST Olivia Cowen, who said Nassar abused her 10 years ago, delivered a victim’s impact statement in front of the former physician last week while holding Michigan State University accountable for his abuse. She is one of more than a hundred women who are delivering victim impact statements during Nassar’s week-long sentencing hearing. “I’ve gone from a raving fan of MSU to now seeing green and white in the very same way I see Larry Nassar,” Cowan said in court last Wednesday. “I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed.” Cowan later added, “As if the struggle of what Larry Nassar did isn’t bad enough, it’s horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing.” An editorial in the State News, Michigan State University’s independent student-run newspaper, also called for Simon to resign, urging the president to “make the right choice, because time’s up.” Several state lawmakers have also asked Simon to step down as university president. But Ferguson told “Staudt on Sports” that the university board of trustees wanted to keep Simon as president, and emphasized her ability to make money. “When you go to the basketball game, you walk in that new Breslin [Student Events Center], and the person who hustled and got all those major donors to give money was Lou Anna Simon,” he said. Ferguson added that while the board of trustees wants Simon as president, trustees would be happy to have the attorney general review the investigation independently.   “Whatever they say, we’ll live with that,” Ferguson said. “But we certainly won’t do anything before the thing, because we actually believe that ... our senior people were not complicit in what this pervert did.”",SPORTS,SPORTS

Mikaela Shiffrin Misses Slalom Podium After ‘Virus-Kind Of Puking’ Before Run,"Mikaela Shiffrin, hoping to make history as the first skier to win back-to-back Olympic golds, finished fourth in the women’s slalom on Friday. Following frustrating delays and her gold medal run in the giant slalom on Thursday, Shiffrin was seen throwing up just before entering the gate for her first run. She told NBC at the bottom of the hill that the sickness came on suddenly and “felt more like a virus-kind of puking, less about nerves.” The norovirus has been been whipping its way across the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, felling staff and volunteers, with 244 reported cases as of Thursday. The Swiss team confirmed Friday that two of its skiers had contracted the virus, becoming the first athletes to be affected at the Games.  It’s rare for Shiffrin to miss the podium entirely. Slalom is considered her best event and the competition she won gold in at the 2014 Sochi Games. NBC News reported that since Sochi, she had made the podium 34 times in world events, missing it only a handful of times.  Frida Hansdotter of Sweden took gold, who said it “was nice to beat [Shiffin] for once, since she’s been beating me for so long.” Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener won silver and Austria’s Katharina Gallhuber took the bronze medal.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Joe Biden Berates White House Over 'Joke' About John McCain's Health,"Former Vice President Joe Biden had two words to describe the moral standing of the Trump administration after a White House aide made a cruel joke about Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) this week: Rock. Bottom. “People have wondered when decency would hit rock bottom with this administration,” Biden said in a statement Friday. “It happened yesterday.” On Thursday, White House aide Kelly Sadler mocked the health of the Arizona senator and Vietnam veteran, who is fighting an aggressive form of brain cancer. “He’s dying anyway,” Sadler said when referring to McCain’s opposition to the appointment of Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA. The White House reportedly confirmed Sadler’s statement and said the “joke ... fell flat.” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders didn’t deny the comments on Friday, but declined to address the specifics on the grounds of not wanting “to validate a leak.”   Biden’s son Beau died in 2015 of a glioblastoma, the same type of brain tumor McCain has been diagnosed with. Biden comforted Meghan McCain last year about her father’s illness and recently visited the elder McCain at his home in Arizona. “John McCain is a genuine hero – a man of valor whose sacrifices for his country are immeasurable. As he fights for his life, he deserves better – so much better,” Biden said. Here’s his statement in full: People have wondered when decency would hit rock bottom with this administration. It happened yesterday. John McCain is a genuine hero – a man of valor whose sacrifices for his country are immeasurable. As he fights for his life, he deserves better – so much better. Given this White House’s trail of disrespect toward John and others, this staffer is not the exception to the rule; she is the epitome of it. Our children learn from our example. The lingering question is whose example will it be. I am certain it will be John’s. ",POLITICS,POLITICS
"U.S. Wildfire Interactive Shows Rising Temperatures, Less Snowfall Are Leading To More Fires","From Climate Central's Alyson Kenward: Wildfire trends in the West are clear: there are more large fires burning now than at any time in the past 40 years and the total area burned each year has also increased. To explore these trends, Climate Central has developed this interactive tool to illustrate how warming temperatures and changing spring snowpack influences fires each year. In our 2012 report, Western Wildfires, we analyzed federal wildfire data stretching back to the 1970s to see how fires have changed in the American West. In some states, like Arizona and Idaho, the number of large fires burning each year has tripled or even quadrupled. And in other states, including California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Wyoming, the number of large fires has doubled. Over the same span, average spring and summer temperatures across 11 Western states have increased by more than 1.5°F, contributing to the higher fire risks. Spring temperatures in Arizona have warmed faster than any other state in the U.S., rising nearly 1°F per decade since 1970, which has likely played a key role in Arizona’s rapid increase in fires over the past two decades. In addition, years with abnormally warm spring and summer temperatures tend to be years with more and bigger fires. For example, 2012 was the hottest spring and summer on record for Colorado, and the state also saw its second-highest number of large fires. The interactive map also includes a preliminary analysis of mountain snowpack data collected at hundreds of monitoring stations across the West. Not surprisingly, years with low spring snowpack (measured as the amount of water in snowpack on the ground as of April 1) also tend to be years with more fires. When there is a relatively thin snowpack come spring, it can melt quickly as the weather warms, leaving the forest drier earlier and much more likely to burn. Across the Southwest in particular, several recent years of below-average spring snowpack has extended the region’s drought and fueled more big fires. This record of western snowpack data begins in 1980, so it’s unclear how well the blue lines in the interactive represent long-term trends and how much they have influenced the growth in wildfires. Other research has shown, however, that there has been a persistent decline in western snowpack since the 1920s. And in looking at the past 30 years, it’s clear that from one year to the next, below-average snowpack raises the risk of wildfires. Western wildfires are also influenced by year-to-year climate variability and how the U.S. Forest Service manages fires, but the trends of rising temperatures and lesser snowpack hint at what fires will look like in the coming decades. Researchers predict that the area burned in the West will quadruple for every additional 1.8°F of temperature rise. According to the draft National Climate Assessment report, the most recent climate model projections show that temperatures will rise between 2°F and 4°F across most of the U.S. within the next few decades, and as much as 8°F by 2100. Here are a few states that have seen the most dramatic changes in wildfires since the 1970s: Nevada Spring snowpack has been decreasing dramatically in Nevada since the early 1980s. And in 2012, the lowest spring snowpack in more than 30 years, combined with above-average spring temperatures, helped fuel the biggest wildfire year in more than a decade. Idaho Idaho has seen the biggest increase in wildfires since 1970 than any other western state. Year-to-year there is still a lot of variability, but in the past decade, several years with above-average temperatures and low spring snowpack have led to dozens of large wildfires on federal land. Colorado Colorado has the second-fastest warming spring temperatures of any state. And in 2012 -- the hottest spring and summer on record for Colorado -- the state saw its second-highest number of large wildfires. Utah In the past decade, more wildfires have burned in Utah in most of those years than any year in the 1970s. And in 2012, thin spring snowpack and above-average spring temperatures contributed to the biggest wildfire year in a decade. Arizona Spring temperatures have warmed faster in Arizona than any other state since 1970. These warming temperatures, matched with decreasing spring snowpack, have helped increase wildfire risk. Every year since 2004 has seen more fires burn in Arizona than in any year in the 1970s. New Mexico Spring warming in New Mexico is among the top three fastest in the country. In the past decade, many more wildfires burned in New Mexico than during the 1970s and 1980s, but the year-to-year variations in wildfires depend on several factors, including temperatures, spring snowpack, and how large the previous year’s wildfires were. Wildfire data is based on fires larger than 1,000 acres that burned on U.S. Forest Service land in the 11 Western states. Temperature data was analyzed according to the methodology described in The Heat Is On, but for spring and summer temperatures. Spring snowpack is represented by April 1 snow-water equivalent measurements collected by the SNOTEL network",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Giuliani Says Mueller Will Wrap Up Trump Obstruction Probe By September: Report,"President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that special counsel Robert Mueller expects to wrap up the portion of his Russia probe focusing on the president’s potential obstruction by Sept. 1, The New York Times reported Sunday. The former New York City mayor told the Times that Mueller’s office gave the Trump team that timeline two weeks ago, amid negotiations on whether Trump would be willing to be interviewed by Mueller’s team, Giuliani said. The Times’ report suggested that Giuliani may be trying to put public pressure on Mueller by sharing that end date. Giuliani also urged that the larger investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election wrap up soon, warning that prolonging the probe risks influencing voters in the midterm elections in November. He reportedly cited former FBI Director James Comey as an example, pointing to Comey’s announcement, just days before the 2016 election, that he would reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server, and how that act was blamed for her losing the White House. The investigation into obstruction is only one part of Mueller’s probe, however, meaning the case wouldn’t necessarily end with its completion. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment when reached by the Times. Giuliani joined Trump’s legal team last month, and in the weeks since has made statements that contradict Trump and his former legal team. Earlier this month, Giuliani described himself as “not an expert on the facts, yet. I’m getting there.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Lawyer Who Ranted Against Spanish-Speakers Faces Office Eviction, Disciplinary Complaint","Lawyer Aaron Schlossberg is facing serious consequences after video footage captured his bigoted diatribe about workers and customers who were speaking Spanish to each other in a Manhattan restaurant on Tuesday. Since the video of his outburst went viral, the Trump supporter has been evicted from his law offices, named in a disciplinary complaint and chased by reporters. He’s been trashed on Yelp and singled out for a mariachi band serenade. Earlier this week, Schlossberg was filmed angrily complaining to a restaurant worker about the people speaking Spanish around him. He said he suspected they were in the country illegally and threatened to call the authorities. “They have the balls to come here and live off of my money I pay for their welfare,” he complained. “The least they could do is speak English.”  Ironically, the website for Schlossberg’s legal business — which has now been trashed online — boasts that he “speaks Spanish.” The New York Daily News reported that Corporate Suites, the landlord of the Madison Avenue space that Schlossberg used for his legal business, barred him from his office on Thursday. “We’ve decided to terminate his agreement with us,” company president Hayim Grant told the News. “His actions don’t fall in line with our beliefs and our community. We’re a diverse community of global businesses that have mutual respect for each other.” Extra points to whoever changed the Google info for Aaron Schlossberg's company to ""Spanish restaurant"" pic.twitter.com/sX4xUyd8H6 Meanwhile, in a letter Thursday to the state court disciplinary system, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. (D) accused Schlossberg of misconduct for his “viral racist rant.” Diaz told The Washington Post that Schlossberg should be suspended or disbarred. Schlossberg ran from news reporters Thursday outside his Manhattan home. He called the police on his phone, saying he was being “accosted by reporters. Please send help.” Schlossberg is apparently no stranger to angry public confrontations captured on video. Manhattan resident Willie Morris posted a vlog about his bizarre encounter with Schlossberg on a street in 2016. The lawyer bumped into Morris, called him an “ugly fucking foreigner,” and threatened to call the police. Another person said that Schlossberg yelled at Jewish people in the street, accusing them of not being “real” Jews.

Surprising Number Of Americans Would Chop Off A Finger To Stay Online,"Americans love the Internet. Some love it so much that they'd rather chop off a finger than stay offline forever, according to a new survey. In March, researchers at AT&T asked over 2,000 Americans what they'd give up to stay connected, and people admitted that they'd part with some pretty essential things. Their answers, which are meant to be more fun than scientific, illustrate the extent to which the Internet has become a nearly indispensable feature of modern life. A full third of respondents said they would sacrifice a digit. Another third said they'd ditch their sense of taste. More than 15 percent of the people surveyed said they'd forgo human interaction before ditching the Internet, and nearly 20 percent said they'd give up love. Over half said they would allow a stranger to die if it meant holding onto their Internet connection. And a measly 35 percent said they would give up the Internet if doing so would allow them to cure cancer.  Overall, men reported being more willing than women to part with things like body parts or their morality. Younger respondents placed a higher value on Internet access than older folks.   While these findings might suggest that Americans are cold-hearted Internet fiends, online access is actually essential for a growing number of everyday activities -- from shopping to applying for jobs to communicating with friends. Not having access to the Internet, or the ability to use it well, can come with significant personal and financial costs.   AT&T's findings are provocative, but they should be taken with a grain (or a handful) of salt. The researchers polled people from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, but their findings aren't nationally representative, according to a company spokesperson, so it's impossible to tell whether the results reflect the opinions of Americans as a whole. It also didn't control for race, income or location. In 2013, a similar study found that 85 percent of respondents would rather go without water than give up mobile apps. A 2015 Pew study painted a less extreme picture: It found that, for nearly 70 percent of Americans, not having Internet access at home would be a ""major disadvantage"" in finding a job and accessing important health data and other information. ",TECH,TECH
U.S. Wins Gold In Cross-Country Skiing For First Time In Decades,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins delivered the first Olympic cross-country medal for the United States since 1976 with a stunning victory in a thrilling finish to the women’s team sprint relay on Wednesday. Diggins held off the challenge of Sweden’s Stina Nilsson in a furious sprint for the line to win gold and Norway’s Marit Bjoergen became the most successful winter Olympian of all time with 14 medals after taking bronze with Maiken Caspersen Falla. “It feels unreal, I can’t believe it just happened,” Diggins told reporters. “In the final stretch I was just thinking, ‘Go, go, go, I‘m giving it everything I had and I’ve got someone who I really love and care about waiting for me at the finishing line and I just want to make her proud’,” she said of Randall. The Americans had not celebrated a medal in cross-country since Bill Koch took silver in the 30km race in Innsbruck more than 40 years ago. “I had so much adrenaline as she was coming down, but if there’s anybody I’d have 100 percent faith in coming down that finishing stretch as fast as possible, it’s Jessie,” said the 35-year-old Randall who is competing in her fifth Olympics. “So that was just a wonderful feeling to take it all in and watch it happen.” Sweden and Norway were hot favorites for yet another gold medal in women’s cross-country skiing and the Nordic nations were at the head of the pack for almost the entire race. With the racers taking turns to speed around the 1,176-meter long track, Randall and Diggins fought to stay in touch with the leaders as the rest of the pack fell away after the halfway point. Randall kept the Americans in the hunt on her final leg, handing over to Diggins for the sixth and final lap which was raced at a furious pace as the lead changed hands several times. Well set up by team mate Charlotte Kalla, Sweden’s Nilsson and Norway’s Falla clashed as they approached the stadium for the final time, and skis touched again as Diggins sought a lane from which to make her push for glory. She passed Falla and set her sights on leader Nilsson, who won gold in the individual sprint, as they rounded the final bend to set up an electrifying finish. Diggins surged past and thrust her ski across the line 0.19 seconds ahead of Nilsson. “I am very proud of our performance, I was really digging deep today to get the power over the last 100 meters, but today USA was too strong and I really think they deserve the gold medal,” Nilsson said.",SPORTS,SPORTS
"Passengers 'Lashing Out' At Scott Pruitt Justify First-Class Travel, New EPA Memo Says","Newly released Environmental Protection Agency documents attempt to justify administrator Scott Pruitt’s frequent use of first-class and business-class travel with a claim that fellow passengers were “lashing out” at him. The 87-word memo, dated May 1, 2017, was drafted by Pasquale Perrotta, who recently quit as head of Pruitt’s personal security detail. Perrotta wrote that he had noticed “lashing out from passengers which occurs while the Administrator is seated in coach with [his security detail] not easily accessible to him due to uncontrolled full flights.” “We believe that the continued use of coach seats for the Administrator would endanger his life and therefore respectfully ask that he be placed in either business and or first class accommodations,” the memo concludes. The justification reportedly allowed the scandal-scarred EPA head to fly in premium cabins, often costing taxpayers thousands more than seats in coach. One trip to Italy cost more than $7,000, The Washington Post notes. Another to Morocco cost more than $16,000. The travel memo obtained by the Post was among thousands of EPA documents released to media outlets on Monday in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. Many show efforts by Pruitt’s staff to limit his encounters with the public. Pruitt is facing 11 investigations into his spending, management practices and ethical lapses. Pruitt’s travel preferences are under investigation by the EPA’s office of the inspector general. The documents also reveal Pruitt’s practice of ducking interactions with average Americans, The New York Times reported on Monday, citing emails in a 10,000-document cache the EPA surrendered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. EPA officials choreographed appearances so Pruitt wouldn’t face questions from the public, worked to limit social media postings during his trips to keep them private, and often arranged events in secret to avoid reporters. “He didn’t want anybody to question anything,” Kevin Chmielewski, Pruitt’s former deputy chief of staff for operations, told The Times. Chmielewski, who said he was pushed out of the agency for questioning Pruitt, said the EPA boss “just doesn’t understand what it’s like to be a public figure.” The EPA has maintained that Pruitt has gotten far more threats than his predecessor, justifying his large security detail and extravagant travel arrangements. The Times notes that there were 33 threat investigations underway as of mid-March. Ten of those involved Pruitt himself, including a message on a “threatening postcard,” missives posted to Twitter and emails and phone calls. BuzzFeed notes that three investigations have been launched this year involving Pruitt, but all have been closed due to lack of evidence that the administrator faced serious harm. One such incident, closed due to a lack of an “overt” threat, involved a Newsweek magazine cover that someone drew a mustache on and taped to an EPA elevator. The release of Perrotta’s travel memo comes several months after the EPA said Pruitt was booked into premium cabins because members of the public yelled at him too much. The agency’s Office of Criminal Enforcement told Politico in February that the administrator was “approached at the airport numerous times, to the point of profanities being yelled at him.” Pruitt has since said he would start flying coach.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Skeletons And Ancient Gold Coins Found During Pompeii Excavation,"Nearly 2,000 years after Mount Vesuvius buried the Roman town of Pompeii in smoldering ash and pumice, archaeologists have announced several rare finds in the ancient ruins. Four skeletons and gold artifacts were recently discovered inside the site of a former shop located near Pompeii's Herculaneum gate, on the outskirts of the city, Forbes reported, citing Italy’s Archaeological Superintendency of Pompeii. (Pompeii is located about 18 miles south of Naples.)  ﻿#Pompeii #TempusVita - A limestone tomb from the IV cent B.C., gold coins, skeletons of fugitives, and an oven used to make bronze objects, are just some of the artifacts found during new discoveries made at Herculaneum gate. The excavation was carried out in collaboration with the Ecole Francaise in Rome the Centre Jean Berard. __ Nuove scoperte a Porta Ercolano. Tra i ritrovamenti una tomba a cassa in lastre di calcare del IV sec. a.C. con  corredo funerario completo, che si aggiunge alle rare testimonianze funerarie di età preromana; in botteghe poco più distanti, monete d’oro e oggetti preziosi ritrovati tra gli scheletri dei fuggiaschi; un forno per la fabbricazione di oggetti in bronzo e ancora una cava utilizzata per l’estrazione di materiale per costruzioni. A photo posted by Pompeii Sites (@pompeiisites) on Jun 24, 2016 at 9:29am PDT Inside the store, archaeologists found a gold pendant necklace, three gold coins and an oven used to make bronze objects. In another area, they uncovered a limestone tomb, dating to the fourth century B.C., which contains a body of a man. The four skeletons, believed to have belonged to young people, were found in the back of the shop. The victims, including an adolescent girl, are believed to have sought refuge inside the store before they were overtaken by the volcano. Sadly, the archaeologists weren’t the first to enter the store’s ancient walls. Looters previously tunneled into the store and in their search of treasure pushed the victims’ bodies against a wall. Several photos shared on the historic city’s Facebook page show piles of scattered bones. The bones’ disarrayed state is far different from the usual Pompeii excavations. When the volcano erupted in 79 A.D., those who were not able to escape were buried in tons of ash. In many cases, this casing preserved them until their discovery hundreds of years later. Excavations at the shop, as well as a second in the area, started in May, the Associated Press reported. A third of the ancient city remains buried beneath volcanic debris.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Police Arrest Larry Nassar's Former Michigan State University Boss,"Police have arrested a former Michigan State University dean who supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar before the sports doctor was arrested and convicted of sexually abusing female athletes, the county sheriff said on Monday. “William Strampel is currently lodged at the Ingham County jail,” Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth told Reuters.  Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State’s College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information. The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony. An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him. The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years. Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place. Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands. He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.

Tim Cook Says EU Ruling On Apple's Irish Tax Is 'Total Political Crap',"DUBLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple’s Chief Executive Tim Cook described an EU ruling that it must pay a huge tax bill to Ireland as “total political crap”, but France joined Germany on Thursday in backing Brussels as transatlantic tensions grow. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Cook’s broadside, saying the demand for a 13 billion euro ($14.5 billion) back tax payment was based on the facts. Washington has lined up with the tech giant, accusing the European Union of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. But in Ireland itself, the government and public opinion are divided over whether to take the windfall - which would fund the country’s health system for a year - or reject it in the hope of maintaining a low tax regime that has attracted many multinationals, creating jobs. A group of independent lawmakers, whose support is crucial to the minority coalition’s survival, called for a review of how tax is collected from multinationals. Their reluctance to back a call for an appeal by the country’s finance minister has cast doubt on whether Ireland will challenge Vestager’s decision. Apple has said it will appeal the ruling which Cook attacked in an interview with the Irish Independent. “No one did anything wrong here and we need to stand together. Ireland is being picked on and this is unacceptable,” the newspaper quoted him saying. “It’s total political crap.” Vestager has questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed the iPhone maker to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. She said on Thursday that the calculations were based on data provided by Apple itself and evidence presented during hearings on Apple tax issues in the United States. “This is a decision based on the facts of the case,” she told a news conference. The battle lines are forming on both sides of the Atlantic. In Paris, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin backed Vestager’s view that Apple’s Irish tax arrangements amounted to abnormal state aid. “The European Commission is doing its job,” he told a news conference. “It’s normal to make Apple pay normal taxes.” German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel also supported the Commission on Tuesday. Austria also welcomed the ruling but Britain - which voted in June to leave the EU - has stayed out of the row, saying it is an issue for the Irish government, Apple and the Commission. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would appeal any adverse ruling ever since the EU investigation began in 2014. However, the cabinet failed to agree on Wednesday whether to accept his recommendation due to misgivings among the five-strong Independent Alliance group of lawmakers. “I don’t think Apple have paid sufficient tax. I don’t think they’ve been illegal in what they’ve done, it’s the tax system as it’s set up,” said Alliance member John Halligan, a junior minister who does not sit at cabinet. “The Independent Alliance have asked that we review our intake of tax, how we take tax in from multinationals and (assess) are we collecting fair tax,” he told RTE radio. After five hours of discussion, the cabinet adjourned discussion of an appeal until Friday when the government said a decision would be made. Any failure of the Alliance to come on board would cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. On the streets of Dublin, some argued Ireland had to keep drawing foreign investors with low tax rates to provide jobs. But others said the government should drop the idea of appealing the decision and take the money. “They are doing the wrong thing. They don’t care about the normal people,” said Louise O’Reilly, 57, a full-time carer for her diabetic and partially blind mother. “The money should be spent on the old-age pensioners who worked all their lives and are struggling to survive.” O’Reilly’s mother pays 10 euros tax on a monthly pension of 1,050 euros ($1,170), a higher rate than the EU said Apple’s main Irish unit paid on its profits in 2014. By contrast, Cook estimated Apple’s average annual tax on its global profits at 26 percent. “They just picked a number from I don’t know where,” he said. But in another interview he promised to boost tax payments by repatriating billions of dollars in global profits to the United States next year. Apple would fight with Ireland to overturn the ruling - by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU - which he said had “no basis in law or in fact”. Cook played down the possibility of the government failing to appeal the decision. “The future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty,” he told RTE radio. “I’m pretty confident that the government will do the right thing.” In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew criticized the ruling. “I have been concerned that it reflected an attempt to reach into the U.S. tax base to tax income that ought to be taxed in the United States,” he said on Wednesday. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Cook said part of the company’s 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States.   (Additional reporting by Padraic Halpin in Dublin and Kylie MacLellan in London; writing by David Stamp; editing by Anna Willard)",TECH,TECH
"Yahoo Cyber Indictment Shows Kremlin, Hackers Working Hand-in-hand","Wednesday’s indictments in the United States of four people in a 2014 cyber attack on Yahoo Inc. provides the clearest details yet on what some U.S. officials say is a symbiotic relationship between Moscow’s security services and private Russian hackers. The indictment charges two officers of the FSB, Russia’s Federal Security Service, and two hackers who allegedly worked hand-in-hand with them to crack 500 million Yahoo user accounts. U.S. authorities and cyber security specialists have long said the Kremlin employs criminal hackers for its geostrategic purposes. They say the arrangement offers deniability to Moscow and freedom from legal troubles for the hackers. A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said employing criminal hackers helps “complement Kremlin intentions and provide plausible deniability for the Russian state.” The FSB in Moscow did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Wednesday evening. The United States sometimes engages with criminal hackers as well, buying tools from them or recruiting them to help find other criminal hackers, cybersecurity professionals and government officials say. Milan Patel, a former FBI cyber agent and now managing director for cyber defense at K2 Intelligence, said the intermingling of espionage and cyber crime in Russia had led the United States and its allies to be far more wary about alerting Moscow to criminal hackers. “Magically those guys would disappear off the battlefield and most likely end up working for the Russian government,” Patel said of the names shared by Washington. The Russian government had no official comment on the charges in the Yahoo case. Russian news accounts stressed that one of the FSB agents, Dmitry Dokuchaev, was arrested by Russian authorities in December and charged with treason. The indictment charges Dokuchaev with having acted as a handler for a hacker named Karim Baratov, directing him to use the Yahoo data to crack emails on other systems and paying him a bounty when he succeeded. Baratov is in custody in Canada, according to the Toronto police, while Dokuchaev remains in Russia. The charges coincide with mounting tensions between U.S. intelligence agencies and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, which they accused of hacking the 2016 U.S. presidential election to influence the vote in favor of then-Republican candidate Donald Trump. In addition, congressional committees are investigating possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Trump. Senator John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement the indictments showed “the close and mutually beneficial ties between the cyber underworld and Russia’s government and security services.” He said the case “underscores the complexity and the urgency” of the committee’s investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election. James Lewis, a former State Department official and now a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there were three rules for cooperation between the Russian government and criminal hackers. Private hackers know to avoid attacking Russian-language sites and to share their profits with authorities, he said. “Rule Number Three (is), if we ask you to do us a favor, do it.”",TECH,TECH
"Apple, Amazon, YouTube Urged To Pull NRA TV Channel","Amazon, Apple, Roku and YouTube are facing increased calls to drop the National Rifle Association’s TV channel from their streaming services, as backlash against the organization grows following a Florida school shooting last week that killed 17 people. The NRA describes its NRA TV channel as a source “for the most comprehensive coverage of the Second Amendment and firearms related issues.” That includes everything from coverage of the Conservative Political Action Conference to far more incendiary videos that border on outright calls for violence, such as this: A 2017 analysis of the channel by the nonprofit Media Matters noted that while NRA TV presents itself as a news outlet, its news and firearms coverage has diminished and instead it “has largely become a platform for far-right conservative talking points that are often unrelated to gun policy.” For example, among a long list of other things, NRA TV hosts have said they’re happy to see the “rat bastards” in the media get “curb-stomped”; claimed that the head of Women’s March, a female empowerment group, “believes in overthrowing the U.S. government for Sharia law”; and said punishing gun owners who fail to store their firearms properly is “like shaming a rape survivor.” On Thursday, Brad Chase ― a friend of Daniel Reed, the father of a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student who survived the shooting ― started a Change.org petition urging Amazon to drop the channel. Chase noted he fully supports the First Amendment and has no problem with the NRA pushing its content on its own website. In his eyes, the real absurdity is companies like Amazon giving them an unchecked conduit into American homes.  “The NRA has long ignored its role in promoting gun violence and betrayed the names of good and responsible gun owners,” Chase wrote on the petition’s page. “It’s time to hold them, and their partners, accountable ... a company like Amazon should not be spreading their message.” Activists rallying around #StopNRAmazon sent the hashtag trending on Twitter Thursday. #DumpNRATV circulated as well, aided by the advocacy group Mom’s Demand Action, which is also calling for the companies to stop offering the channel. “NRATV is home to the NRA’s most dangerous and violence-inciting propaganda,” Shannon Watts, the group’s founder, said in a release. “It’s time for tech leaders to acknowledge their role in helping the NRA spread this dangerous content and cut it out.” “We demand that Apple, Amazon, AT&T’s DIRECTV, Google and Roku all dump NRATV once and for all,” she said. Amazon, Apple and YouTube did not respond to a request for comment Friday.  A Roku spokeswoman told HuffPost the company operates “an open streaming platform ... representing a wide range of topics and viewpoints” and removes channels that violate its content policies. She noted Roku customers have the option of setting a PIN to prevent channels from being downloaded. While the Silicon Valley companies are apparently sticking with the NRA, others have begun to jump ship. The First National Bank of Omaha said it would no longer issue NRA-branded Visa cards. The company that owns Enterprise, Alamo and National rental cars also said it would end its partnership with the group, as did MetLife, which offers home and auto insurance to NRA members.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
How To Take Advantage Of Trending News Stories,"Nowadays it can be a real challenge to cut through the noise and stand out in the media. But an excellent place to start is by taking advantage of the stories that are already getting noticed. Breaking news stories, the latest trends and current affairs are more likely to capture your target audience's attention, generate social sharing and encourage brand engagement.  Seizing stories that are trending in the news and online, a concept known as 'newsjacking' is an excellent way to get key messages in the media, provide expert opinions and build thought leadership. Here are some strategies to follow when looking to take advantage of trending news stories. Pick the right story
You need to be able to determine which stories are going to work for the message you have crafted. Only leverage stories which would engage your audience and relate directly to your brand and business. For example, if you run an insurance company and you notice a lot of stories in the media about rising insurance premiums, you can pitch yourself to a relevant journalist as an expert to comment on these issues.  Be prepared 
Be proactive and prepare for all possible opportunities. Think about topics which relate to your area of expertise and brainstorm any possible news events that could be related to these topics. You can then reactively pitch to news outlets when a similar story emerges.  Media and social media monitoring
A big part of this process is monitoring the conversations in the media and on social media. By keeping up to date, you will be better able to pick up on stories that will work.  Following journalists and news outlets on Twitter is an excellent way to keep informed of all breaking news stories and find media opportunities. Twitter allows you to organise followers into separate lists which can make it easier to view recent tweets from journalists and news outlets.  Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have streams which showcase what news stories and topics are the most popular with users.  Accessing these trending topics provides an insight into what your target audience is talking about and what content they are engaging with.  Be timely
Timeliness is very important in terms of capitalising on breaking news. It is important to be aware of what's going on in your industry.  When you do find something relevant to your industry and have something appropriate to respond with, it is a good idea to post a response through your social media, through a blog post, or reach out to the media.  Be resourceful
When responding to a trending news story, it is important to be as informative and resourceful as possible. Provide journalists with new material they haven't directly written about before and ensure that you are offering an expert opinion or advice to back up your story. Offering a different angle to current trending stories is an excellent way to pique a journalist's interest in your story.   It is important to remember that not every news story will be suitable to respond to. You need to approach leveraging trending news stories ethically and sensitively. Think about the ways that you can use real time engagement authentically.  With the right approach, preparation and consideration you can leverage the latest new stories and trends to get noticed.

Senate Republicans Shun Don Blankenship On Day Of West Virginia Primary,"WASHINGTON ― Don Blankenship may not win Tuesday’s Senate GOP primary in West Virginia, but that uncertainty didn’t stop his would-be colleagues in the nation’s capital from already giving him the cold shoulder. Blankenship, a former coal company CEO who served prison time for his responsibility in the deaths of 29 workers in a 2014 mining disaster in his home state, reportedly has seen his support surge in the primary race after generating media attention with overtly racist and controversial statements. He attacked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), using the slur “Chinaperson” to describe the lawmaker’s father-in-law and then standing by his remark when called on it. He also argued in a campaign ad that McConnell “has created millions of jobs for China people.” McConnell’s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, was born in Taiwan and her parents are Chinese.  In one TV ad, Blankenship even dubbed McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” on the dubious basis that the drug was found on one of the cargo ships owned by Chao’s family several years ago.  McConnell demurred on Tuesday when asked whether he would support Blankenship in the general election against Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.) if the former business executive defeats Rep. Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey for the GOP nomination. “We’ll wait and see who wins in West Virginia and we’ll have more to say on it tomorrow,” the Senate majority leader told reporters.  But some of his GOP colleagues were less hesitant to speak out against Blankenship who, if he emerges as the nominee, will spur a barrage of question about what that says about the their party. “I just don’t see a scenario where that’s a positive projection of the Republican brand,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the vice chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a group dedicated to electing GOP Senate candidates. He added that he would not personally support Blankenship if he wins the nomination. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) said he’d “have a hard time” backing Blankenship, citing some of the comments he has made. “He’s not my favorite person,” Inhofe said. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate GOP leader, said it was too early to say whether he could support Blankenship. But he added that he did not view the controversial candidate as not a good representative for the Republican Party. Even Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.) seemed less than enthusiastic about the prospect of Blankenship as her state’s other Senate member. She declined on Tuesday to tell reporters who she voted for in an early ballot she cast last week. “I had a written record [of it], and luckily nobody else can see it but me,” she said. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) made clear in a Monday Twitter post his view of Blankenship. The problem isn’t that Don Blankenship can’t win a general election in West Virginia, it’s that he shouldn’t win a general election in West Virginia. #CountryOverParty Flake, known for his criticism of President Donald Trump, also told reporters that he’ll donate to Manchin’s campaign if Blankenship wins the primary. “I think you’ll see a lot of Republicans making a contribution” to the Democrat, he said.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Russian Olympian Who Wore 'I Don't Do Doping' Shirt Fails Doping Test,"Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva appeared in an Instagram video this month wearing a sweatshirt declaring “I don’t do doping.” Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games.

I am ZASPORT,” a reference to the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, has since been deleted from Instagram, according to The Guardian. The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. ABC News said the video was produced last year to promote the clothing brand. Sergeeva was spotted in a similar shirt in Pyeongchang earlier this month. The Associated Press said she wore a white T-shirt with the words “I Don’t Do Doping” under her racing suit during a training session. #Russian Bobsled Pilot Who Wore ‘I don’t do doping’ T-Shirt Fails #Olympic Doping Test - @washingtonpostНадежда Сергеева #ZASPORT (Unofficial)Не официальная реклама ZasportЛокация: Россия/Сочи/Красная ПолянаСъемка и монтаж: Роман БибишевАтлет: Надежда Сергеева pic.twitter.com/WBT3MyVYNI Sergeeva — who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeongchang — tested positive for an angina medication with performance-enhancing properties on Feb. 18, the Russian bobsleigh federation announced on its Facebook page. She passed a drug test five days earlier. Sergeeva denied taking the drug. The federation’s president, Alexander Zubkov, said the athlete had not been prescribed any medication. Sergeeva was the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at the Pyeongchang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug.  The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program, but allowed a group of athletes to compete under the Olympic flag.  The IOC said it considered lifting the suspension for Sunday’s closing ceremony so OAR athletes could march under the Russian flag. In the end, however, the committee decided to keep the ban in place because of the two failed drug tests. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Meet The Most Powerful Woman In Particle Physics,"Fabiola Gianotti isn't new to CERN, the Geneva, Switzerland-based research organization that operates the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest particle collider. In fact, the Italian particle physicist was among the CERN scientists who made history in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson. But now Gianotti isn't just working at CERN. As the organization's new director-general -- the first woman ever to hold the position -- she's running the show. And though expanding our knowledge of the subatomic realm remains her main focus, she's acutely aware that she is now a high-visibility role model for women around the world. ""Physics is widely regarding as a male-dominated field, and it's true that there are more men in our community than women,"" Gianotti told The Huffington Post in an email. ""So I am glad if in my new role I can contribute to encourage young women to undertake a job in scientific research with the certitude that they have the same opportunities as men."" Recently, HuffPost Science posed a few questions to Gianotti via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers. How will things be different for you in your new role? My new role is very interesting and stimulating, and I feel very honored to have been offered it. The range of issues I have to deal with is much broader than before and includes scientific strategy and planning, budget, personnel aspects, relations with a large variety of stakeholders, etc. Days are long and full, and I am learning many new things. And there is nothing more enriching and gratifying than learning. What's a typical day like for you? Super-hectic, super-speedy and ... atypical! What do you think explains the gender gap in science generally and in physics particularly? There are many factors. There's no difference in ability between men and women, that's for sure. And in my experience, the more diverse a team is, the stronger it is. There is the baggage of history, of course, which takes a long time to overcome. There is the question of the lack of role models, and there is the question of making workplaces more family friendly. We need to enable parents, men or women, to take breaks to raise families and we need to support parents with infrastructure and facilities. Your term as CERN's director-general is scheduled to last five years. What are your goals for CERN during this period? The second run of the LHC is the top priority for CERN in the coming years. We got off to a very good start in 2015, and have three years of data-taking ahead of us before we go into the accelerator's second long shutdown. The experiments are expected to record at least three times more data than in Run 1 at an energy almost twice as large. It will be a long time before another such step in energy will be made in the future. So, the coming years are going to be an exciting period for high-energy physics. But CERN is not just the LHC. We have a variety of experiments and facilities, including precise measurements of rare decays and detailed studies of antimatter, to mention just a couple of them. In parallel with the ongoing program, we will be working to ensure a healthy long-term future for CERN, at first with the high-luminosity LHC upgrade scheduled to come on stream in the middle of the next decade, and also through a range of design studies looking at the post-LHC era -- from 2035 onwards. What discoveries can we reasonably expect from CERN during your term? I'm afraid that I don't have a crystal ball to hand. There will be a wealth of excellent physics results from the LHC Run 2 and from other CERN experiments. We'll certainly get to know the Higgs boson much better and expand our exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model. Whether we find any hints of the new physics everyone is so eagerly waiting for, however, I don't know. We know there's new physics to be found. Good as it is, the Standard Model explains only the 5 percent of the universe that is visible. There are so many exciting questions still waiting to be answered. What are the biggest opportunities at CERN? The biggest challenges? These two questions have a single answer. Over the coming years, the greatest opportunities and challenges, not only for CERN but for the global particle physics community as a whole, come from the changing nature of the field. Collaboration between regions is growing. CERN recently signed a set of agreements with the U.S. outlining U.S. participation in the upgrade of the LHC and CERN participation in neutrino projects at Fermilab in the U.S. There are also emerging players in the field, notably China, whose scientific community has expressed ambitious goals for a potential future facility. All this represents a great opportunity for particle physics. The challenge for all of us in the field is to advance in a globally coordinated manner, so as to be able to carry out as many exciting and complementary projects as possible.  Were you always interested in being a scientist? If you couldn't be a scientist, what would you be/do? I was always interested in science, and I was always interested in music. I pursued both for as long as I could, but when the time came to make a choice, I chose science. I suppose that as a professional physicist, it is still possible to enjoy music -- I still play the piano from time to time. But as a professional musician, it would be harder to engage in science. What do you do in your spare time? I spend my little spare time with family and friends. I do some sport, I listen to music, I read. What do you think is the biggest misconception nonscientists have about particle physics? That it's hard to understand! Of course, if you want to be a particle physicist, you have to master the language of mathematics and be trained to quite a high level. But if you want to understand the field conceptually, it's almost child's play. All children are natural scientists. They are curious, and they want to take things apart to see how they work. Particle physics is just like that. We study the fundamental building blocks of matter from which everything is made, and the forces at work between them. And the equations that describe the building blocks and their interactions are simple and elegant. They can be written on a small piece of paper.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

"Landslide in Oso, Washington -- Don't Blame Nature and Acts of God for Reckless Logging","The 300-acre landslide in Oso, Washington, which killed at least 30 people and destroyed the local community on March 22, 2014, reveals a consequence of a relatively unregulated and unseen industry: logging. Logging was not the sole cause of the disaster -- March was the wettest on record, a condition possibly exacerbated by climate change, and the geology of the area features soft soils -- but logging apparently played a major role.  The media often do not investigate the reasons behind an event such as the landslide, attributing to ""Mother Nature"" or ""Acts of God"" disasters that were actually manmade. For example, Time magazine called the Oso landslide a ""natural disaster"" without mentioning the likely influences of logging and climate change.  The plateau above the hillside that gave way has been logged for almost a century, and the hillside has a history of landslides dating back more than 60 years. For more than 25 years, as the slope became more unstable, scientists challenged the timber cutting and warned of possible calamity. Yet the state continued to allow logging on the plateau. A ""clear-cut"" is an area of land in which all the trees have been cut down. One suspected trigger of the Oso landslide is a clear-cut, undertaken 9 years ago, that apparently encroached into a restricted area and is only now being investigated.   The landslide, which occurred near the banks of the Stillaguamish River, was not only predictable; it was also predicted. New York Times reporter Timothy Egan recounts touring the headwaters of the Stillaguamish 25 years ago with Pat Stevenson, a biologist with the local Stillaguamish tribe: ""Stevenson pointed uphill, to bare, saturated earth that was melting, like candle wax, into the main mudslide. Not long ago, this had been a thick forest of old growth timber. But after it was excessively logged, every standing tree removed, there was nothing to hold the land in place during heavy rains. A federal survey determined that nearly 50 percent of the entire basin above Deer Creek had been logged over a 30-year period. It didn't take a degree in forestry to see how one event led to the other.""  Forest root systems hold the soil in place, and old-growth forests absorb about ten times as much water as clear-cut land.   Logging usually occurs far from the public eye. Most people remain unaware of the devastation wrought by typical modern logging practices, which rely on large machines and few workers to clear-cut the land. Near public roadways, uncut ""beauty strips"" of forest give passing motorists the illusion of unspoiled landscapes. Satellite images, however, often provide a very different, bird's-eye view of shorn forests.  Logging plans are not widely publicized. In my home state of Massachusetts, logging plans are filed with the town's conservation commission, which is often a group of volunteers. Even in the small town in which I live, and where I am relatively plugged-in to the goings-on, I was taken by surprise by the sound of logging machines near my house several years ago.  When people complain about rapacious logging, the toilet paper argument is invariably used to shut them up. The fact that we all use toilet paper is supposed to provide a carte blanche for loggers to do whatever they want to the forest. Yes, we all use wood, but many of the trees that are cut are wasted, often used to fuel biomass power plants, which have disastrous environmental impacts, or to create single-use pallets, junk mail and excess packaging. Much wood and paper ends up in a landfill or incinerator instead of being recycled or reused.  Logging proponents trivialize the damage from logging, arguing that although the land initially looks ravaged, the trees will grow back. They neglect to mention that this process takes decades and that invasive species may be what grow back. Forester Gordon Robinson writes, ""If logging looks bad, it is bad. If a forest appears to be mismanaged, it is mismanaged.""   A system of belief that defies science and justifies irresponsible logging has become entrenched in our government agencies and universities (particularly, in university forestry departments largely funded by the logging industry). One popular excuse for logging is to claim that the trees are diseased and need to be cut down for the good of the forest. Another popular excuse is that trees should be cut down to help wildlife. Loggers escape the burden of proving such claims. Government agencies often green-light logging without adequate environmental impact analysis or protection of vital resources.  Rather, the burden of proof that logging may be damaging unfairly falls on unpaid citizens. In 2006 and 2007, a group of citizens in Massachusetts applied modern science -- bringing in experts as needed -- to refute one unsupported excuse after another attempting to justify logging in Robinson State Park. The would-be loggers floated out 22 reasons to log the land,  and the citizens shot down each one. The state ultimately denied the timber company a permit; not one reason to log could be found that had any legs. Today, Robinson State Park is safe from logging and proves that intense public pressure can overcome even entrenched pro-logging bureaucracies. Logging is treated as a presumptive right, even on public land. For example, in Washington, if a permit application to log is not reviewed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) within 30 days, it is automatically approved. And not only is enforcement of logging regulations lax, but the regulations themselves are inadequate.   Forestry seems to operate in the fantasy world of the 1950s, before the advent of modern environmental regulations. Paul Kennard, a geomorphologist with the National Park Service, explains that the DNR is pressured by timber companies, in a ""no tree left behind"" environment: ""It's a don't-rock-the-boat culture ... a very cronyistic, forester-friendly, we're-gonna-help-these-folks culture.""  Forests provide much more than wood. They hold our earth together, mitigate climate change, filter the air and water, cool the earth, provide flood storage, offer habitat and food for countless species and create a refuge for the human soul. Irresponsible logging erases these benefits, rolls out the welcome mat for invasive species and Lyme disease carriers and releases carbon dioxide, worsening climate change. It's time to halt irresponsible logging practices and bring the timber industry to accountability. Citizens can speak up to loggers and legislators. Wood harvesting can be done intelligently to supply what we need without damaging our lands, undermining our other resources and endangering our citizens.  Is our society unable to make change until catastrophic, headline-making fatalities occur? With the Oso landslide, this prerequisite has been tragically satisfied.

Yahoo Downplays Its Billion-Password Security Breach In Emails To Users,"Yahoo is emailing at least some of the 1 billion users whose account information was hacked in 2013. Thursday’s email seems to imply that hackers didn’t acquire users’ passwords. That’s misleading. Here’s a portion of the email Yahoo sent users (emphasis ours): The stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. [...] The stolen information did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. Let’s break it down. First, hackers accessed at least a billion “hashed” passwords (which look like “286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4”); second, hackers did not access “clear-text” passwords (which look like “password”). Yahoo’s email refers to its web page, which says that “passwords that have been hashed can’t be reversed into the original plain text password.” This statement is misleading. There are plenty of tools online that quickly convert a hashed password into a plain text password. “I have to assume any guessable password was guessed quickly,” says Jeffrey Goldberg, who works for the password-management company 1Password.  Goldberg estimates the hackers could have calculated 800 million to 900 million Yahoo usernames and passwords within weeks of the breach. So why does Yahoo claim hashed passwords can’t be reversed? Because it’s going with a very specific definition of “reverse.” For readers without math degrees, “you’re getting these two mixed messages,” says Goldberg. For password-security experts, you “know exactly what this means.” It means the attackers probably guessed most passwords very quickly. If Yahoo had “salted” users’ passwords ― a technical process that prevents passwords from being discovered on certain websites ― then reversing them would take far longer. Goldberg assumes Yahoo didn’t “salt” its passwords, because the company’s email doesn’t mention it. When asked Thursday, Yahoo refused to say whether it “salted” passwords in 2013. The company says it “salts” its passwords now, and it did when hackers stole 500 million users’ account information in 2014. The company is now disabling affected users’ accounts until they change their passwords. Goldberg suggests users go one step further: “If the password you used on Yahoo is used on any other service, you should assume it’s compromised there as well.” So ignore the top half of Yahoo’s email. Follow the instructions near the bottom: Change your passwords and security questions and answers for any other accounts on which you used the same or similar information used for your Yahoo account. ",TECH,TECH
"Uber Is Adding A Panic Button, 3 Years After Rolling One Out In India","If your Uber ride lands you in an emergency situation, you’ll soon be able to alert 911 from within the app. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the addition in a blog Thursday morning as part of what the company is calling a “safety center” that will live on the home screen during rides. Critically, the 911 feature will display the car’s real-time location so riders can pass the information along to dispatchers. Uber will eventually provide that information directly to 911 dispatchers automatically, but for now, the ability only exists in Denver, where it’s being beta tested. In addition to calling the cops, the safety center will let riders share their location and trip data with up to five contacts. Uber will share the company’s process for driver background checks and insurance information in that part of the app, as well as the community guidelines ― Uber’s list of actions that will result in riders getting banned. Uber customers in India have had access to a similar panic button since 2015 after an Uber driver raped a woman in New Delhi. At the time, Uber said it had no intention of bringing the feature in the U.S.  “In the U.S., 911 is the panic button,” then Uber security chief Joe Sullivan told the Washington Post in 2016, adding it would be “a stretch” for the company to improve on pre-existing emergency alert infrastructure. That’s the sort of mentality Khosrowshahi wants to move away from as he seeks to burnish Uber’s tarnished public image. “The first thing that we want to do is really change Uber’s substance, and the image may follow,” Khosrowshahi told the Associated Press in an interview published Thursday. “The announcements that we’re making are just a step along the way of making Uber fundamentally safer for drivers and riders.” As part of the safety initiatives, Uber also says it will run background checks on all its drivers on an annual basis and proactively search for any criminal complaints against its employees in between screenings as well.",TECH,TECH
Google Doodle Celebrates Planetary Discovery In The Most Adorable Way,"Google is celebrating this week’s planetary discovery with a home page doodle that’s out of this world. In an adorable cartoon, Earth is seen peering out into space with a telescope as the moon ― a.k.a. “Earth’s little buddy,” as Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield described it ― watches from behind. That’s when Earth comes across one lone exoplanet smiling back at it, leading to an ambush of six other cosmic characters. One even waves back.  The colorful doodle, which was crafted by Nate Swinehart, graced the home page one day after NASA announced the discovery of seven exoplanets some 40 light-years away, part of what scientists have named the TRAPPIST-1 system ― after the TRAPPIST telescope that found them. Exoplanets are planets orbiting a star that is not our sun.  All seven are described as Earth-sized, and at least three of them are in the habitable zone of the star, where a planet is most likely to contain liquid water. However, scientists said that under the right conditions, all seven could potentially have water. NASA said the discovery is the largest of its kind. “This discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Answering the question ‘are we alone’ is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal.”",TECH,SCIENCE
'Pokemon Go' Users Are Going To Yik Yak To Get Tips,"Users of the popular “Pokemon Go” smartphone game are using Yik Yak for help catching them all. (How many times have you heard that phrase in the past week?) Yik Yak is an anonymous social media app where users can post to forums that are restricted only to people within a 1.5 mile radius. This makes the app popular on college campuses, where young people are often gathered in one geographical location. With that geographic restriction, it makes Yik Yak better than Facebook or Twitter to share tips about finding Pokemon. “Pokemon Go” requires users to travel around real-world locations to catching Pokemon, so getting a tip about what’s available in your neighborhood is invaluable.  Since “Pokemon Go” was released on July 7, about 1 in 8 posts on Yik Yak has been about the game, according to the messaging app. Data from Yik Yak shows it’s been an especially big topic in the Midwestern states. The company says they’ve seen Yakkers use the app to share the best bus routes to catch Pokemon and organize meetups with local trainers. ",TECH,TECH
Asian Americans versus Asian Americans,"I have realized how much more bridge building is needed among and by Asian Americans. I recently attended an event a good friend of mine organized in Northern California. Karthick Ramakrishnan is the most prominent scholar on Asian American political participation; it’s probably him if anyone is in the media talking about the subject. A professor of South Asian descent, he has wanted to convene a pan-Asian coalition to advance shared interests. He has started the process, but it will take energy to sustain. Critics of hyphenated identity claim it divides. They want us all to be simply American. They are not aware that “Asian American” is all about forming a union among people whose ancestors would not have been committed to any contact other than conquest. Both words in the title are important. They are signals to others and one’s self. Asians are amalgamating as other immigrant communities have done in overcoming their past hatreds for the common ground of this democracy. The insistence on the American aspect of identity also is an assertion that one belongs here. Ironically, when I was growing up, my only wish was to be accepted as simply American, and I was all too eager in assuming if I avoided anything Asian that would be so, automatically — exactly as the puppet Pinocchio became a real boy, in one of those Western fairy tales we memorized though our parents had not heard of it. “Asian American” is better than the names, the various ethnic slurs emitted by passersby and cranks on the telephone and strangers who rang the doorbell and ran off. Of course Asian Americans are artificial. That is true of all human groupings by definition. Asian American is perhaps more deliberately constructed. It depends on constant effort to hold together. East Asians and South Asians in particular are competitive even as colleagues. When other people say, “You all look alike,” they mean they are likely to confuse Chinese for Japanese, not brown for yellow. There are discrete cultural origins: while much of East Asia has linguistic and religious relationships dating back before national borders were set or nations were even a clear concept under law, the Indian subcontinent speaks a dialect of the Indo-European language family and more than a few persons have lineage that is Caucasian. The function I went to was inspired by a conversation between someone East Asian, native born, and someone South Asian, an immigrant, who were candid about infighting. They did what leaders do, turn opposition into opportunity. What unites these rivals in places such as Silicon Valley is that they form an enemy for those who deem people of color as a threat. Asians might not even have been conscious that they appeared as a menace, having no aspiration other than prosperity. For those around them who are certain demography is destiny, that very success looks like a hostile takeover. Asian Americans, however, are registering the antagonism. They cannot help but notice it. Tech leaders are saying they cannot “outsource” the response to civil rights activists alone. So Asians who want their cousins to be able to come here have reason to join together to advocate. Although their lack of enthusiasm for politics is faulted, their attempts to join movements likewise has met backlash. They are viewed with suspicion for their loyalties and motives. Asian Americans also should reach across the Pacific Ocean. Asian Americans who are assimilated, some of them, have distanced ourselves as deliberately as possible. We are too wary. I count myself among those who have made this error. They — we — have learned to be cautious, because suspicions fall upon them (us) if they utter a word hinting they (we) are anything less than America Firsters. The display of indifference toward a “homeland” they/we left, were forced from, or perhaps have never set foot on (as the third generation on these shores) turns into authentic apathy. Even as others lacking the heritage take up Mandarin for an adventure, we are reluctant to expose ourselves to the disdain casually directed at our parents who had accents. We find ourselves on both sides of the line: “them” versus “us” is ambiguous for Asian Americans even if we are suffer no ambivalence on our part. We can withhold judgment of those who adapt under the circumstances. If you find yourself the one and only child in the classroom who looks like you, especially adopted or mixed, you have no genuine choice. You cannot be expected to maintain a culture without critical mass around you. Yet there remains a responsibility assigned to Asian Americans, regardless of their reluctance to take it on, of serving as intermediaries, translators literally and figuratively. The epiphany for many is that acquiescing to the role is in one’s self-interest, and it offers enriching experiences. You give in and learn it doesn’t impose but relieves a burden: to speak with your grandparents across generations is to speak to the other half of the world, and you are the better for it, not least in the eyes of your elders. The last line is the most difficult to overcome, because it is internal. It is not subtle. The established members of the ethnicity and those who in that pejorative phrase coming to be appropriated with pride, “fresh off the boat” are not the same. Their mutual contempt may exceed that of observers who could not distinguish between them, aggravating them even further. There is a “disconnect” between Asian Americans who conceive of themselves as domestic racial minorities and Asian immigrants whose reference point is literally foreign. The Asian Americans who march with “Black Lives Matter” perplex the Asian immigrants, perhaps their own parents, whose sympathies are elsewhere. These populations in fact are distinct. Old-timers came when America was the dream and Asia “backward;” newcomers, as Asia ascends and America becomes increasingly anxious. The former had to leave behind their village without any assurance they would see their family again, ever, as much due to the distance and the cost as geopolitical barriers that included concrete roadblocks. The latter connect via social media as if they had never departed; they are effectively transnational, enjoying the same jokes and soap opera as before they boarded the jumbo jet for a routine trip. The alarm each side feels is troubling — but not as they imagine. An observer who could step away or imagine a vantage point in the not too far future would perceive that the established Asian Americans, like white ethnics, Jews, and Hispanics who are not Latinos before them, fear those coming later will spoil everything with their rudeness, their lack of refinement, their foreign ways, their arrogant disregard about fitting in, and, above all, their overwhelming numbers. If the volume of Asian immigrants in line (or not bothering to follow the protocols for queuing) bothers white Americans as a portent of power shifting, the quantity undoubtedly will disenfranchise Asian Americans who settled long ago. On their part, Asian immigrants are disappointed Asian Americans are not more welcoming even as they fear their own children will turn into Asian Americans. They, also like their predecessors of all types and every era, hope for the comfort of continuity, to be very much in America but not necessarily of America. “Asian American” is all about bridge building. Bridge building is vital, in every direction. That means among Asian ethnicities, both East and South; to Asians overseas; and to Asians arriving now. Then there is bridge building to blacks and whites. Asian Americans, neither black nor white, can be intermediaries and mediators. Karthick’s research is definitive. He leads a study of Asian American civic engagement. His data shows Asian Americans are a potential influence. Their numbers are headed up, and they are, on average (with caveats), educated and affluent. Yet by conventional predictors, their civic engagement is not as robust as could be. I have confidence. America is an ongoing experiment. It is a project, thanks to the democratic process. It is not a product, to be bought and sold. It is messy, always incomplete, needing work. Asians can contribute to progress. We have to feel the desire to do so.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
"Scientific Spill Studies, Funded by BP, Start to Yield Results","(This article is published in ""The Louisiana Weekly"" in the Feb. 10, 2014 edition.)  Scientists gathered in Alabama last month said their current research on impacts of the 2010 BP spill will help authorities deal with future disasters. More than 900 people registered for the 2014 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill & Ecosystem Science Conference, held from Jan. 26 to 29 in Mobile. Many of the projects discussed were funded by the nonprofit Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative or GoMRI, the chief sponsor of the conference. BP pledged $500 million to GoMRI in May 2010 for ten years of independent studies. So far, more than a third of that money has been distributed to research consortia, made up of universities and federal entities. The Mobile meeting included 150 lectures and 400 poster presentations. During the gathering, the University of Rhode Island's Metcalf Institute for Marine & Environmental Reporting held seminars in Mobile to bring journalists up to date on spill findings. Scientists, mainly from universities, addressed a dozen reporters in sessions over three days. Research to date has yielded some results about the impacts of spilled BP oil and the dispersants used on it. ""Oil is still out there, and it's resistant and having an effect on the coast,"" Nancy Rabalais, executive director of Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium or LUMCON in Cocodrie, told Metcalf seminar participants. She leads GoMRI's Coastal Waters Consortium. Rabalais and her colleagues are focused on marsh ecosystem ecology, mainly in the Terrebonne and Barataria estuaries west of the Mississippi River. ""Our research, looking at conditions before, during and after the spill, is still evolving,"" she said. ""Some areas were recovering from the spill. But in August 2012, Hurricane Isaac stirred everything up, so we've had re-oiling."" Spartina marsh grass is coming back nicely in some places but its roots are dying in other spots, Rabalais said. Oiled marshes are eroding. Overhangs of oiled coastal land are falling into bays. Small islands that were oiled are particularly vulnerable now, and they're eroding faster than large islands. And since the spill, nests of seaside sparrows in areas exposed to oil have had less success reproducing, caring for their young and surviving.  Unlike a number of spill researchers who began with little or no baseline data, the staff at LUMCON--which was founded 35 years ago and now has an annual $4.6 million research budget--has decades of stats on Gulf coastal ecosystems, hypoxia, aquaculture, phytoplankton, fisheries, coastal restoration and river-ocean interactions. ""We have a good, long set of data that allows us to tell whether oil is a factor,"" Rabalais said. A LUMCON professor and LSU adjunct professor, she's an expert on hypoxia, benthic ecology and coastal ecosystems. Rabalais said some researchers published their post-spill findings too quickly while conditions were still uncertain. For spill researchers to have any confidence in results, their studies need three to ten years, she said. Dubravko Justic, a distinguished LSU oceanography professor and one of the investigators in GoMRI's Coastal Waters Consortium, spoke at the Metcalf seminar. The eastern side of the Barataria Bay estuary in Plaquemines and Jefferson Parishes was heavily oiled in the 2010 spill, he said. Numerical modeling and satellite imagery indicate that oil entered Barataria Bay's estuary through tidal inlets, particularly at Barataria Pass and Quatre Bayou Pass. All lower Mississippi River freshwater diversions, including the Caernarvon Diversion on the east bank in St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes and the Davis Pond Diversion in St. Charles Parish, were opened during the spill to flush out oil, he noted. Modeling results suggest that opening the river diversions did little to push oil slicks away from Barataria Bay, however, Justic said. Slicks appear to have moved into the bay in clockwise activity associated with southeasterly winds. Barataria Bay and its marshes are breeding grounds for shellfish, fin fish, alligators, migratory birds, songbirds, ducks and geese. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has designated the bay as an estuary of national significance. Numerical models are beginning to take into account the complex, bottom topography of Louisiana's deltaic estuaries, Justic said. ""When viewed in high resolution, the Barataria Bay Waterway looks like the Grand Canyon,"" he said. He believes his group's modeling on slicks in estuaries will help Louisiana officials as they build more river diversions to defend the coast.  Vijay John, Tulane University engineering professor, is the principal investigator of C-MEDS, the Consortium for the Molecular Engineering of Dispersant Systems, funded by GoMRI and comprised of 22 universities. Dispersants are used to break oil slicks into small droplets in the ocean, where they biodegrade, John said at the Metcalf seminar. C-MEDS is developing more effective dispersants that are less concentrated than current, commercial products, with fewer environmental impacts. The dispersant used to combat the Deepwater Horizon spill was COREXIT 9500, produced by Nalco in Illinois and cleared for use in the disaster by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In particular, John is researching environmentally benign biopolymers, or substances made up of small molecules chemically joined together, to improve the stability of dispersants so that oil particles remain separated in ocean water for long periods. Applications that his group is studying are intended to reduce the volume of dispersants needed to fight a spill. In addition, C-MEDS researchers are examining clays that attach to oil droplets, natural dispersants from fungi and the use of blood-gelling technologies to produce dispersants. But it may be ten to twenty years down the road before new, more benign dispersants are commercially available, John said. Oil companies, including ExxonMobil and Shell, are engaged in dispersant research and are members of the C-MEDS consortium. Agnes Kane, Brown University pathology professor, spoke at the Metcalf seminar about whether nanoparticles might be an alternative to dispersants. She and Brown engineering professors Robert Hurt and Huajian Gao want to know if nano-sorbents, which can capture and sequester oil, are safer and more effective than dispersants in combating spills. COREXIT prevents slicks from forming on the ocean by suspending oil in the water as tiny particles, Kane noted. But larvae feed on those particles, larger organisms eat the larvae and toxins in the oil--including benzene, benzopyrene and naphthalene--move up the food chain and bio-accumulate. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has exposure limits for benzene, benzopyrene and naphthalene, which are known carcinogens. Kane said nanoparticles might be effective as sponges that sop up those toxins. Her interdisciplinary research is funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and she is co-director of a training grant on nanotechnology from the U.S. Dept. of Education. Her dispersant-related research is also funded by the National Science Foundation, GoMRI and Brown University. Where did most of the oil spilled in 2010 go? ""The scenario of oil from the Macondo well flowing up the East Coast, into the northern Atlantic and to the Azores didn't occur,"" said Arthur Mariano, oceanography professor at the University of Miami, addressing Metcalf participants. He and colleagues developed particle-trajectory forecasting systems and applied them to oil from the Macondo well. Eddies in the Gulf of Mexico during the blowout were one of the factors that prevented oil from moving to the East Coast, he said. Because of eddies, ocean currents and winds, spilled oil formed tentacles or filaments and moved in nonlinear fashion. ""We placed markers or drifters near each other off Louisiana's coast in July 2012, tracked them using GPS satellites, and after a couple of weeks they were hundreds of miles from one another,"" Mariano said. That showed how tough it is to predict oil's movement in the Gulf. Mariano's group concluded that, by late 2010, between 20 and 25 percent of oil spilled from the Macondo was in the water column, and much of the rest had evaporated, been removed or had settled on the ocean floor. ""Noisy, inconsistent and incomplete ocean data, however, have made it difficult to track the movement of oil from the spill,"" he said. Budget constraints, including the $10,000 to $20,000 a day it costs to rent a research vessel, have hampered studies. ""Nonetheless, a lot of science is being conducted to learn about the movement of oil in the environment,"" he said. Other speakers at the Metcalf journalists' seminar in Mobile included Ph.D. chemist Tom Coolbaugh at ExxonMobil; Temple University biology professor Erik Cordes; University of South Florida oceanographer Kendra Daly; University of Texas, Galveston toxicology professor Cornelis Elferink; Gulf of Mexico Disaster Response Center director Charlie Henry; and Florida State University oceanography professor Markus Huettel.   Metcalf Institute's executive director Sunshine Menezes, with a Ph.D. in biological oceanography, moderated the journalists' seminar. The sessions, she said, introduced participants to current knowledge about the effects of the 2010 spill and gave them new contacts. Metcalf received funds for the seminar from the Consortium for the Molecular Engineering of Dispersant Systems or C-MEDS, which is in the third year of a GoMRI grant. An initial plan to focus the talks on development of new dispersants--the research goal of C-MEDS--was broadened to make them more useful to journalists, Menezes said. Some of the twenty reporters registered for the Metcalf seminar were kept away by icy weather, she also said. According to GoMRI, $178 million of BP's $500 million pledge has been disbursed for scientific research so far. Under GoMRI's guidelines, that money is solely for research, including sampling, modeling and studies, and can't be used to purchase infrastructure. Studies funded by GoMRI must be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, with no requirement for BP approval.

"Uber Paid Hackers $100,000 To Keep A Massive Data Breach Quiet","Uber confirmed Tuesday that it paid hackers $100,000 to keep quiet after an October 2016 attack led to the disclosure of 57 million customers’ personal data, Bloomberg first reported. The breach included the names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers related to accounts of people around the world, the company said. About 600,000 Uber drivers also had their names and driver’s license numbers stolen. More sensitive information, including trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth, was not accessed. More troubling than the hack itself: Instead of disclosing the breach to the affected customers and proper government authorities, Uber decided to pay the unnamed hackers to keep quiet. That was likely the decision of chief security officer Joe Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor Uber hired from Facebook. Sullivan and an additional team member were fired this week.   Most states have laws requiring that companies notify consumers who are affected by a data breach. Although not all require customers to be notified in a specific timeframe, many mandate that it happen as soon as possible. For example, in California, where Uber is based, the disclosure must happen in “the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.” There’s currently no evidence that the leaked data has been used for nefarious purposes, Uber told customers Tuesday. “We do not believe any individual rider needs to take any action,” the company said in a statement. “We have seen no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident. We are monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection.”  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined the company in September, addressed the breach in a blog Tuesday. “None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Khosrowshahi wrote. “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes. We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers.” “We have to be honest and transparent as we work to repair our past mistakes,” he said. Khosrowshahi said the company is providing affected drivers with free credit monitoring and identity theft protection.",BUSINESS,TECH

Tiger Solidifies Comeback With Stellar Second Round In Bahamas,"(Reuters) - Tiger Woods got off to a fast start and fired a four-under par 68 despite a pair of bogeys on the back nine as his comeback continued at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Friday. The solid second-round effort, which included an eagle and four birdies, left the former world number one tied for fifth place at seven-under 137 in his first tournament in nearly 10 months following spinal fusion surgery. With his swing of old back for the most part, Woods held the lead at the turn thanks to an eagle at the ninth and remained at or near the top until a poor drive and bogey at the last. Charley Hoffman’s sizzling 63 that included 12 birdies gave him the lead at 12-under 132, three strokes ahead of Jordan Spieth (67) and Tommy Fleetwood (69). Justin Rose (68) was alone in fourth at 136 with Woods among a group of five at 137. (Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina; Editing by Toby Davis)",SPORTS,SPORTS
FIFA Whistleblower Chuck Blazer Dead At 72,"(Reuters) - Chuck Blazer, the former FIFA executive committee member who pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, has died, his lawyers said on Wednesday. A statement from Blazer’s two lawyers did not provide details or the circumstances of his death. The New York Times said he had died of rectal cancer, which he had suffered for years. Blazer, 72, was general secretary of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) from 1990 to 2011. He pleaded guilty in the United States to bribery and financial offenses in 2013 and was later banned by FIFA from all football activities for life.  According to the transcript of his November 2013 guilty plea, Blazer and others in FIFA agreed to accept bribes in the bidding process for the 1998 World Cup in France and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. FIFA’s ethics committee said Blazer breached rules on loyalty, confidentiality, duty of disclosure, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts, and bribery and corruption. As part of the 2013 plea agreement, Blazer agreed to cooperate with investigating authorities in the United States while they investigated the FIFA corruption scandal, which eventually played a crucial role in the departure of its former president, Sepp Blatter. Blazer had accused another former CONCACAF president, Jack Warner, of having pocketed funds from a $10 million project to support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries at the time of South Africa’s successful bid to stage the 2010 World Cup.  FIFA opened an ethics investigation over bribes-for-votes allegations in the 2011 FIFA presidential election after Blazer reported a possible case of bribery between Blatter and then FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam.  Warner and Bin Hammam were also banned by FIFA for life.   FIFA was not immediately available for a comment on Blazer’s death. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, which is overseeing the FIFA probe, did not respond to a request for comment. Blazer was born on April 26, 1945 in New York, according to the New York Times. He worked as a salesman and coached his son’s soccer games in New Rochelle, New York, in the late 1970s before beginning his rise in international soccer. Blazer kept a blog detailing his travels and his meetings with dignitaries, celebrities and politicians, including a visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2010. “At one moment, he looked at me with a very serious gaze and said, without cracking a smile, “You know, you look like Karl Marx!” Blazer wrote. In one blog post, the white-bearded Blazer posted a photo of himself dressed in a red Santa Claus suit smiling as he peered over a pair of eye glasses. In another, Blazer posted a video of Max, his blue and gold parrot, dancing as he stood on the front of a scooter in Central Park near a group of jazz musicians. “Go max, go. It’s ok,” a man’s voice, purportedly Blazer’s, is heard on the video. Blazer was on a motorized scooter along Fifth Avenue in New York in November of 2011 when federal agents approached him, the New York Daily News reported. “We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can cooperate,” the agents told him, according to the newspaper. He cooperated. His then-domestic partner, Mary Lynn Blanks, told Reuters in a 2016 article that she accompanied Blazer to soccer-related events while he was acting as an informant for U.S. investigators, sometimes wearing a bugging device.",SPORTS,SPORTS
The 'Pokemon Go' Servers Went Down And People Totally Freaked Out,"Servers for the “Pokemon Go” game crashed on Saturday, sending obsessed players across the globe into a frenzy. The game acknowledged the situation on Twitter. Trainers! We have been working to fix the #PokemonGO server issues. Thank you for your patience. We'll post an update soon. Several possible explanations surfaced following the crash. Gizmodo reported on a possible Distributed Denial of Service attack at the hands of a hacking collective known as PoodleCorp, which they said took credit for the incident. Another possible cause, Kotaku speculated, was a bottleneck of new players signing on from 26 additional countries. Developer Niantic announced the additions in a Facebook post made several hours before the crash. Forbes notes that the game had some instability shortly after release but that it “has since recovered, and has seemed pretty stable throughout the past week, a few crashes and other glitches notwithstanding.” The unofficial Pokemon Go News Twitter account reported Saturday afternoon that the game is back up and running, with slow login times for some players. SERVER UPDATE: It appears the #PokemonGO servers are back online. Service and login time may be slow for some users. Of course, many people couldn’t handle the specter of a ruined Saturday: Pokemon Go servers down, cancelled my walk bc I'm not weird im going pokemon hunting today i hope the servers are back up soon #PokemonGo servers are down.....?!Half the world right now (including myself): pic.twitter.com/9fBpYAUuxl I have a 4 hour car ride ahead of me.

MLB's First Player Just Took A Knee During The National Anthem,"Bruce Maxwell, catcher for the Oakland Athletics, just became the first major league baseball player to take a knee during the national anthem in Saturday’s game against the Texas Rangers. The team released a statement on Twitter shortly after. “The Oakland A’s pride ourselves on being inclusive,” the statement read. “We respect and support all of our players’ constitutional rights and freedom of expression.” The political statement came a day after the president criticized athletes who protest during sporting events. Last year, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was booed for taking a knee during the national anthem while his team played the San Diego Chargers. Kaepernick said the silent protest was meant to bring awareness to injustices against minorities in the United States. It has been a source of controversy ever since. During a rally on Friday night, President Donald Trump outraged dozens of professional athletes when he implicitly called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” and asked for athletes protesting to be fired.  But Maxwell was undeterred. He tweeted several times on Saturday in regards to the issue, saying it was about “just complete inequality.” He also wrote that no one should be “surprised if you start seeing athletes kneeling in other sports now.”  ″Inequality is being displayed bigger than ever right now as our president shows that freedom of protest and speech is not allowed,” Maxwell tweeted hours before Saturday night’s game. From the @sfchronicle’s Santiago Mejia, here is A’s rookie Bruce Maxwell becoming the first MLB player to take a knee for the anthem: pic.twitter.com/q8QVY9hW15 MLB.com’s Jane Lee tweeted a statement from Maxwell later in the evening, responding to negative comments he received for his protest. More from Maxwell: pic.twitter.com/3w1JYWPkRp “I get nasty DMs and everything, but that also shows what’s wrong with this country,” Maxwell said. “People think athletes should shut up and get their money and play their sport, but no matter how much money we make, no matter how many touchdowns we score, no many how many home runs we hit, it doesn’t mean we aren’t people. Our paychecks don’t silence us.”  Trump’s comments came after NBA star and Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said he would not be attending the team’s visit to the White House. The president later rescinded the invitation and caused an uproar.  ″(Athletes are) all trying to do what we can,” Curry said Friday, before Trump’s rally. “We’re using our platforms, using our opportunities to shed light on that, so that’s kind of where I stand on it. I don’t think us not going to the White House is going to miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.” Earlier this year, several New England Patriots players refused to attend a celebration at the White House, a traditional visit for teams who win sports championships. Some of the players who stayed away said that Trump displayed racist rhetoric throughout his campaign and that they wouldn’t feel accepted in the White House. Major League Baseball has largely remained outside the issue, as the sport has comparatively kept silent on the politics of racial inequality in the country. Meanwhile, players of color in the NFL and the NBA have used their platforms to highlight the issue of racial injustice in the U.S. Basketball superstar LeBron James, who gave a scathing response to Trump’s comments about Curry on Saturday, expressed in a tweet why the matter was so personal and important to him. James was the victim of a hate crime earlier this year. “Obviously, we all know what happened with Charlottesville and the divide that that caused,” James said. “And now it’s hitting home for me even more because [Trump]’s using sports as the platform to try and divide us.” This story was updated to include Bruce Maxwell’s statement to MLB.com.",SPORTS,SPORTS
ESA Lander Prepares For Historic Mars Landing,"FRANKFURT - A Mars lander is due to leave its mothership on Sunday and head toward the red planet’s surface to test technologies for Europe’s planned first Mars rover, which will search for signs of past and present life. After a seven-month journey from Earth as part of the European-Russian ExoMars program, the Schiaparelli lander is expected to separate from spacecraft Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) at 10:42 a.m. EDT and start a three-day descent to the surface. Schiaparelli represents only the second European attempt to land a craft on Mars, after a failed mission by the British landing craft Beagle 2 in 2003. Landing on Mars, Earth’s neighbor some 35 million miles (56 million km) away, is a notoriously difficult task that has bedevilled most Russian efforts and given NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity. But a seemingly hostile environment has not detracted from the allure of Mars, with U.S. President Barack Obama recently highlighting his pledge to send people to the planet by the 2030s. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is developing a massive rocket and capsule to transport large numbers of people and cargo to Mars with the ultimate goal of colonizing the planet, with Musk saying he would like to launch the first crew as early as 2024. The primary goal of ExoMars is to find out whether life has ever existed on Mars. The current spacecraft carries an atmospheric probe to study trace gases such as methane, around the planet. Scientists believe that methane, a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life, could stem from micro-organisms that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet’s surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive. The second part of the ExoMars mission, delayed to 2020 from 2018, will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet’s surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples. The ExoMars 2016 mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA), with Russia’s Roscosmos supplying the launcher and two of the four scientific instruments on the trace gas orbiter. The prime contractor is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales and Finmeccanica. The cost of the ExoMars mission to ESA, including the second part due in 2020, is expected to be about 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion). Russia’s contribution comes on top of that. In 2018, NASA also plans to launch a Mars spacecraft, a satellite known as InSight and designed to study the deep interior of Mars.

Kentucky Attorney Running For Judge Dies 1 Day After Primary Win,"An attorney running for judge in Kentucky collapsed and died Wednesday, the day after winning his race’s primary. Danny Alvarez, a 43-year-old married father of three running for Jefferson County District Court judge in Louisville, collapsed at his home, according to local media. A cause of death was not immediately released. His campaign consultant, Jonathan Hurst, described Alvarez as “a true public servant, a humanitarian, and a champion for human rights and the immigrant community” in a statement obtained by Louisville station WHAS. “Danny spent the day humbled and grateful to this community after his historic victory last night,” Hurst added. “He would want us to honor his memory by showing compassion and love to all people.” Tanisha Ann Hickerson, who finished just behind Alvarez in the primary on Tuesday, said in a statement that his death “goes beyond elections, jobs and careers.” “His passion for equality and his fight for fairness are unparalleled,” she said. “I will miss him terribly, and I’m praying for his wife and children.” Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also offered his condolences to Alvarez’s family, describing the lawyer as “a tireless advocate for justice, a vessel of hope and inspiration for so many.” So saddened by the passing of Danny Alvarez. He was a tireless advocate for justice, a vessel of hope and inspiration for so many. I am grateful to have known him. Prayers for his family and friends. Descansa en paz. Louisville Democrats expressed “shock and bewildered sorrow.”  “Our jubilation at his success has turned to grief at his passing,” the party’s chair, J. Russell Lloyd, said in a statement that praised Alvarez as “a friend, colleague, advocate and role model.” Alvarez launched his own law firm in 2003 and handled a range of cases, including immigration matters, according to his Facebook page. His parents were immigrants from Bogota, Colombia, and he spoke Spanish fluently.",POLITICS,POLITICS
I Still Have So Many Questions About This Juicero Thing!,"Juicero is a start-up company that apparently wanted very much to disrupt the “juice space.” And in pursuit of that goal, its executives managed to convince Silicon Valley investors to pony up $120 million in seed money, which has led to the production of a $400 machine that squeezes bags of juice. But Bloomberg Technology reporters Ellen Huet and Olivia Zaleski zeroed in on an interesting fact behind all of Juicero’s hooplah: Apparently, bags of juice can be squeezed by an existing product called “the hand,” which in most instances retails for “free” and nearly just as often includes a “buy one, get one” option. And “hands” apparently squeeze these bags of juice just as well as Juicero machines. Check it out: And thus, Huet and Zaleski have answered an important inquiry: “Do you need a $400 juicer?” The answer is no. But having read their story, I still have so many questions! Let’s go through Bloomberg’s story and you’ll see what I mean. One of the most lavishly funded gadget startups in Silicon Valley last year was Juicero Inc. It makes a juice machine. The product was an unlikely pick for top technology investors, but they were drawn to the idea of an internet-connected device that transforms single-serving packets of chopped fruits and vegetables into a refreshing and healthy beverage. Why does your juicer need to be “internet-connected?”  Doug Evans, the company’s founder, would compare himself with Steve Jobs in his pursuit of juicing perfection. He declared that his juice press wields four tons of force—“enough to lift two Teslas,” he said. Why does anyone need that much force to squeeze juice? I mean, you’d think that a machine that could lift just one Tesla would do the trick. “Not good enough,” Evans told his engineers, “I need that second Tesla’s worth of Newtons.” Maybe the original goal was to build a Two-Tesla Lifting Machine, and initial market research revealed scant demand for such a thing? A person close to the company said Juicero is aware the packs can be squeezed by hand but that most people would prefer to use the machine because the process is more consistent and less messy. Is it though? Here’s how I get juice. Open fridge, get juice, pour into glass, voila! I find it hard to believe that people “would prefer to use the machine.” (Also: “A person close to the company?” That person, close to the company, should have leveled with the company, saying something like, “I dunno, guys, a $400 bag squeezer? [Sound of sharp intake of breath.]” The device also reads a QR code printed on the back of each produce pack and checks the source against an online database to ensure the contents haven’t expired or been recalled, the person said. The expiration date is also printed on the pack. Whyyyyyyyyyyy? The creator of Juicero is something of a luminary in the world of juicing. People can be that? Evans, 50, follows a diet of mostly raw, vegan foods. Technology was a new thing for him, but he picked it up quickly. Did he, though? In fundraising meetings, Evans promised a revolutionary machine capable of squeezing large chunks of fruits and vegetables, said two people who agreed to invest in the company. Evans secured funding in 2014 by showing 3D-printed renderings of the product without a working prototype, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they signed nondisclosure agreements. Did they also ask to not be identified because they look so foolish? But after the product’s introduction last year, at least two Juicero investors were taken aback after finding the packs could be squeezed by hand. Wait. They didn’t know that bags full of juice could be squeezed by hand?  Doug Chertok, a Juicero investor, said he figured it out on his own. “There is no doubt the packs can be squeezed without the machine,” he said. “I’m still a huge fan.” Bu-bu-but ... how are you still a fan? Didn’t they basically take your money and set it on fire?  He said the company is a “platform” for a new model of food delivery, where fresh fruits and veggies are delivered regularly to the home. Should I be the one to break it to this guy that these kinds of services have existed for many years? “Juicero is still figuring out its sweet spot,” he said. “I have no doubt that they’ll be very successful.” Someone just needs to build a bigger machine with the lifting force of seven Teslas to help find this sweet spot, no doubt. But what really went wrong here? “It’s very difficult to differentiate yourself in the food and beverage sector,” said Kurt Jetta, who runs retail and consumer data firm Tabs Analytics. “Entrepreneurs may be tempted to have a technology angle when it’s not really there.” And there it is. ~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.  ",TECH,TECH

Brazilian Tennis Player Pulls Racist Eye Gesture At Line Judge In Japan,"A Brazilian tennis player has apologized and been fined for making what appeared to be an offensive gesture during a Davis Cup match in Japan. Guilherme Clezar was caught on camera mockingly stretching his eyes on Friday after he had successfully challenged a line judge’s call during the crucial third set of his clash with Japan’s Yuichi Sugita, per multiple reports. See the racist move in this video. Essa foi a reação de Guilherme Clezar quando um juiz de linha errou uma marcação contra o brasileiro. pic.twitter.com/37pbcPLuif After tennis fans around the world expressed their outrage, the 24-year-old player issued an apology on Saturday. He said he’d never intended to be “aggressive, racist” or “prejudiced” toward Asian people. Clezar claimed to have “an excellent relationship” with other players in a statement shared on the Brazilian Tennis Confederation’s Facebook page. “Even though I didn’t mean any prejudice, I recognize the gesture doesn’t ring true with the attitudes of respect, enthusiasm, solidarity, emotion and many other things that sport means to us,” he added, according to the BBC. Clezar is currently ranked 244th in the world. He went on to lose the match in straight sets of 6-2, 7-5, 7-6. The International Tennis Federation investigated the incident and decided to fine Clezar $1,500 for “unsportsmanlike conduct,” the BBC reports. “The incident was reported after the match and the TV footage was then reviewed by the tie referee,” federation officials said in a statement. “Clezar issued a written apology. The ITF condemns all forms of offensive behavior.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
Trump Promised To Reshape America. He's Already Told 1 Million Immigrants Who Had Legal Protections To Get Out.,"WASHINGTON ― From the day he launched his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has made it pretty clear what he wants America to look like. He doesn’t want Mexico’s “bad people,” immigrants from countries he did or did not describe as “shithole nations,” or refugees he says are a “Trojan horse” seeking to do Americans harm.   And he’s made some progress in carrying out that vision. Trump has moved to terminate temporary protections for more than a million people, effectively telling a population the size of Rhode Island to either leave the country or face deportation. He’s looking to make it harder for asylum-seekers to find refuge in the U.S. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 140,000 immigrants last fiscal year, while building up a force that will aim to detain tens of thousands more.  Trump’s latest efforts to curb immigration came on Friday, when the Department of Homeland Security announced it will end temporary protected status, or TPS, for immigrants from Honduras. That means 57,000 Hondurans who found refuge in the U.S. after Hurricane Mitch wrecked their country in 1998 will have to leave or find another legal status by 2020.  The move didn’t come as a surprise. In the past year, the Trump administration has done the same for about 200,000 TPS holders from El Salvador, 46,000 from Haiti, 9,000 from Nepal, 2,500 from Nicaragua and 1,000 from Sudan, and for 4,000 Liberians who were in the U.S. on another type of temporary visa. The administration has effectively decimated TPS, announcing plans to terminate its protections for about 98 percent of current recipients, based on the argument that conditions in their native countries have improved.  Trump also put the futures of some 690,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children in jeopardy when he terminated the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last fall. The president argued he was forced to end the DACA program because it was unconstitutional and said lawmakers should instead create a legal solution for these Dreamers, as they’re known. But those efforts failed ― in part when Trump demanded major concessions in exchange ― and Dreamers remain in a precarious position. They’re currently safe because court rulings have kept DACA running in part, but that could change, and they could yet again risk losing protections that have let them live and work without fear.  That’s more than a million people in total who have been living and working legally in the U.S. who, thanks to Trump, now face an uncertain future, one in which they may be driven out of the workforce, ripped away from their families and sent back to countries ― some of them dangerous ― that they haven’t seen in years. If they stay without authorization, TPS and DACA recipients could be caught up in a deportation system that is increasingly sweeping up people without criminal records. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that no one is exempt from enforcement and that it won’t look the other way if it finds another undocumented immigrant while looking for one of its targets. About 17 percent of the people deported from the interior of the country last year were noncriminals, a massive jump from the year before, when people without criminal convictions made up 8 percent of the removals from the interior.  As the Trump administration works to expel immigrants from the U.S., it is working to make it harder for new immigrants to enter the country.  During the presidential campaign, Trump said that he wanted to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the country. He didn’t do that, exactly, but did order a string of travel bans that targeted immigrants from several Muslim-majority nations. Although courts blocked large parts of the bans, other vetting measures have contributed to dramatically lower immigration levels from those countries. The president singled out Syrian refugees and tried in his first travel ban to indefinitely shut down resettlement of Syrians into the U.S. That, too, was blocked, but Syrian refugee admission numbers are minuscule. Only 11 Syrian refugees came to the U.S. from January to the end of March.  Refugee admissions in general have dropped dramatically, all while the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II, with many people displaced by wars that the U.S. plays a role in. In Trump’s first year in office, the U.S. admitted 53,700 refugees, down from 85,000 the year before and less than half of the number set for the year by former President Barack Obama before he left office.  This fiscal year, the numbers are even more stark. The U.S. admitted only 10,500 refugees in the first six months, which means it’s unlikely to even reach the ceiling of 45,000 set for the year ― which was already 10,000 less than the previous year, and 40,000 less than the one before that.  He would exclude more immigrants if he could. “They’re not sending their finest,” he said Friday of migrants apprehended at the border. “That I can tell you. We’re getting some real beauties in here.”  Trump wants to end the diversity visa lottery, which allows many people from African countries to move to the U.S., and to limit family-based migration, which he derisively refers to as “chain migration.” He is also seeking policy changes that would allow the government to detain and deport more people who seek asylum at the border, rather than releasing them into the U.S. while their cases are being heard.  In sum, the trend is to restrict immigration. “The Trump administration has been very consistent. Wherever it has discretion about a group of people or a program, it tends to err on the more restrictive side,” said Randy Capps of the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute. To immigration activists, Trump’s goals are pretty obvious. “The jig was up after his comments about shithole countries,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, a Dreamer with DACA status and executive director of the advocacy group United We Dream. “There’s no mincing of his words, and that’s why we’re not mincing ours. He’s not only anti-immigrant, but he’s a threat to people of color in this country.”  But it’s unclear whether that’s what Americans actually want. Forty-one percent of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, versus 52 percent who do not, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released in April. There’s widespread support among voters for giving legal status to Dreamers who benefit from DACA, although so far it hasn’t translated to any action from Congress.  “I don’t think a Trump rally represents the majority of Americans on the question of immigration,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum. “Yes, people have serious questions about the issue but I’m not sure they like the way Trump is answering those questions.” In addition, Noorani says, now that Trump is following through on campaign promises on immigration, many people experience direct effects on their businesses and communities and it changes their opinion. And there’s only so much Trump can do. The demographic trends of the country would be nearly impossible to stop, especially without major changes to legal immigration that would require congressional action. The Senate has rejected the president’s immigration policy platform, which would have included legal protections for DACA-eligible immigrants but also restricted legal immigration pathways and made it easier to reject people who request asylum.  Terminating DACA and TPS wouldn’t guarantee all of those individuals would leave the country, either. Even without legal protections, both Dreamers and TPS holders might stay in the U.S. because they have built lives here, or because they believe their native country is too dangerous, even if Homeland Security doesn’t. “This is our home,” Martinez Rosas said. “We’re going to fight as much as possible to stay here.” ",POLITICS,POLITICS
Sexual Assault Clinics Offered At Winter Olympics For The First Time,"The 2018 Winter Games in Pyongchang, South Korea, is making the fight against sexual assault a higher priority than ever before at the games, unveiling four support centers providing resources for victims in a myriad of languages. The centers stem from a recommendation following the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro that each Olympic Games create ways to safeguard workers and spectators, the International Olympic Committee told HuffPost in a statement. Pyeongchang’s Organizing Committee decided to create spaces, mainly in spectator areas that are near police outposts. These centers cater to the Olympics workforce and ticket holders ― groups that have been reportedly subjected to sexual violence during past Olympics. For athletes, medical clinics are equipped with a team of 10 psychologists and psychiatrists prepared to respond to any complaints of abuse, Susan Greinig, the IOC’s safeguarding officer, said at a news conference last week. Jeon Won Hee, who has been manning one of the four centers, called the initiative “symbolic.” “This is very meaningful, but the more important thing is knowing that sexual violence can occur anywhere at any time,” she told NBC News. Gangwon-do, the province that includes Pyeongchang, provided funding for the centers, Mic reported. They’re open eight hours a day, with a phone hotline available in 13 languages at night.  “If something happens, we want to provide emergency counseling, medical and legal support,” said Kwon Eun-jin, head of women’s welfare for the province. The IOC committed to enhancing gender equality in 2017, undertaking a comprehensive review across the organization. Based on the findings, a pilot program aiming to establish a balanced portrayal of both genders is underway in Pyeongchang, the organization said. Greinig said the IOC has been working to prevent harassment and abuse for several years. For the Rio Olympics, she noted, the IOC implemented hotlines for reporting abuse and launched a safeguarding program in which an officer was available to field complaints. The fact that sexual activity goes hand in hand with high-stakes athletic competition is no secret. U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon, for example, openly commented on the condom selection in Pyongchang over the weekend.   But the Olympics brings together people from different cultures who hold various perspectives on appropriate behavior, said Kristen Dieffenbach, associate professor of athletic coaching education at West Virginia University and an executive board member for the Association for Applied Sport Psychology. Some “make a big deal of young girls, there’s an enthusiastic party culture,” Diffenbach noted. “There are teams that stay away from the Olympic Village for that reason. It’s very analogous to the first week of college, or spring break week.” Sexual violence has affected Olympic athletes for years. Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor, was sentenced to prison this month for sexually abusing hundreds of young athletes, including Olympic medalists. “Sport’s an odd place fraught with some of the nuances of abuse,” Dieffenbach said. “You have a whole realm of issues related to just the power dynamic and what constitutes abuse, is it screaming at an athlete, pushing them to be their best? There are a lot of people who would debate where that line is.” Yet the reckoning that has held abusers to account has only taken off in recent months, propelled by the #MeToo movement. “MeToo allowed us all to see that it’s not the victim’s fault, being sexually harassed,” said Sungsook Kim, a Catholic nun who runs one of the Olympic Village centers. “It gives courage to the victims.” ",SPORTS,SPORTS

How Much Is A Boss Worth?,"An awful lot of Americans are skeptical about the value of their nation’s corporate executives. As a 2016 nationwide survey reveals, 74 percent of Americans believe that top corporate executives are overpaid. This public dismay with CEO compensation exists despite the fact that Americans drastically underestimate what top corporate executives are paid every year. In fact, the survey found that CEO compensation at Fortune 500 companies was approximately ten times what the typical American thought it was. What are these CEOs actually paid? According to a study for the Associated Press by the executive data firm Equilar, in 2016 the typical CEO at the S&P 500 companies received $11.5 million in salary, stock, and other compensation. Of course, this was the median CEO income. Some were paid a great deal more. Thomas Rutledge (Charter Communications Inc.) received $98 million during 2016; Leslie Moonves (CBS Corp.) $68.6 million; Robert Iger (Walt Disney Co.) $41 million; and David Zaslav (Discovery Communications Inc.) $37.2 million. A few CEOs didn’t make the list because, as fantastically wealthy business owners (like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, collectively worth $146 billion), they didn’t bother taking a salary from their companies. CEO income during 2016 reflected substantial increases over the preceding year, with the typical CEO getting an 8.5 percent raise. Some, especially the best-paid, received far more. Rutledge received a raise of 499 percent, while Moonves’s pay rose by 22 percent. American workers haven’t been doing nearly as well. According to the AFL-CIO (which estimated average corporate CEO pay in 2016 at $13.1 million), the average production or other nonsupervisory worker earned only $37,632 that year. Thus, in 2016, there was a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 347-to-1. This gap between CEO and worker pay has been widening substantially over the years. In the 1950s, the S&P 500 CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 20-to-1. Even as late as 1980, it was 42-to-1. But the rise of the political Right, the adoption of pro-corporate public policies, and the decline of union strength have led to a situation in which the average CEO of America’s largest corporations has an annual income 347 times that of the average worker. In the last five years alone, corporate CEOs received percentage pay increases nearly double that of the U.S. workforce. This enormous and rapidly growing economic inequality between bosses and workers can certainly be challenged on the basis of social justice. Why, after all, should roughly 20 million Americans, working at full-time jobs (and, sometimes, two or three jobs), receive such pitiful incomes that they are forced to rely on food stamps and other forms of public assistance while their CEOs grow ever wealthier and enjoy an opulent lifestyle once limited to kings and princes? In addition, are these extravagantly-paid corporate CEOs producing commensurate value for their companies? According to a detailed 2016 study by MSCI, an investment and corporate research firm, businesses that provided their CEOs with higher incomes delivered smaller financial returns to investors than did companies with lower compensation for their top executives. Favorably impressed by the study, a Forbes columnist concluded that “maybe it is time to rethink and restructure CEO compensation.” Indeed, some corporate boards have begun doing just that. Although most Americans do not serve on the boards of major corporations, they do support sharp reductions in CEO compensation and other means of fostering greater economic equality. Indeed, a recent survey has found that a typical American favors limiting CEO pay to no more than six times the pay of the average worker. Furthermore, polls have found that most Americans support increasing taxes on the rich and substantially raising the pathetic federal minimum wage, long stuck at $7.25 per hour. Against this backdrop, it’s striking that the Republicans controlling Congress and the White House champion huge tax cuts for the wealthy and oppose any increase in the minimum wage. But, in this case, as in so much of American politics, he who pays the piper calls the tune.

"Aaron Hernandez Had CTE, Boston University Test Confirms","Aaron Hernandez, the former football player who was serving a life sentence for murder before he died by suicide, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), according to a Boston University test. The neurodegenerative disease has been linked to depression, memory loss and dementia. The Boston University CTE Center test determined Hernandez had Stage 3 CTE, with Stage 4 being the highest. Hernandez played for the New England Patriots from 2010 to 2012. Earlier this year, he was found dead in his jail cell from an apparent suicide while serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Jose Baez, Hernandez’s attorney, said Thursday at a news conference that he has a filed a lawsuit against the Patriots and the NFL on behalf of Hernandez’s daughter, Avielle. In the suit, Baez alleges that the team and league were “fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat, or protect him from the dangers of such damage,” The New York Times reports. In a statement released by Boston University, the researchers who examined Hernandez’s brain released an image and explained what they found.  “This graphic shows the classic features of CTE in the brain of Mr. Hernandez,” the statement reads. “There is severe deposition of tau protein in the frontal lobes of the brain (top row). The bottom row shows microscopic deposition of tau protein in nerve cells around small blood vessels, a unique feature of CTE.” A recent study that examined 111 brains of former NFL players found that 110 of them had CTE, according to ESPN. Last year, a top health official with the NFL acknowledged a link between football-related head trauma and the brain disease. So far, the disease can only be definitively detected through autopsies.  “We are grateful to the family of Aaron Hernandez for donating his brain to the VA-BU-CLF brain bank,” BU said in a statement. Last year, BMX legend Dave Mirra was found to have had CTE when he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  ",SPORTS,SPORTS
"Top-Tier Gymnast Maggie Nichols Says Larry Nassar Sexually Abused Her, Too","Gymnast Maggie Nichols alleged Tuesday that she was among the young women sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar.  In a statement released by Nichols’ attorney, the former elite gymnast alleged that Nassar sexually abused her “numerous times,” starting when she was 15 years old.  “Recently, three of my friends and former National Team members who medaled at the 2012 Olympics have bravely stepped forward to proclaim they were sexually assaulted by USA Gymnastics Team physician Dr. Larry Nassar,” Nichols said in the statement, obtained by Time magazine. “Today I join them.” Nichols said she was the first victim to alert USA Gymnastics of Nassar’s abuse in 2015, which subsequently led to his arrest in 2016. She wrote that she was discussing Nassar’s treatment with a teammate during practice one day when a coach overheard. “I had never told my coach about these treatments,” Nichols said. “After hearing our conversation she asked me more questions about it and said it doesn’t seem right ... so she did the right thing and reported this abuse to the USA Gymnastics staff.”  Nassar has been accused of serial sexual abuse by over 125 young women, including elite gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. All of the victims claim that Nassar abused them during routine medical exams; some say they were as young as 12 at the time of the alleged abuse.  The disgraced physician pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. The 54-year-old was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography.  Nichols began competing as a top-tier gymnast when she was 13 and made the U.S. Women’s National team at 14. She retired in 2016 after failing to make the 2016 Olympic team due to injury.  The 20-year-old revealed that she is one of the dozens of unidentified plaintiffs currently suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University.  “Up until now, I was identified as Athlete A by USA gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University,” she said. “I want everyone to know that he did not do this to Athlete A, he did it to Maggie Nichols.”  The alleged abuse began in 2015 when Nichols joined the national team and began having back problems.  When I was 15 I started to have back problems while at a National Team Camp at the Karolyi Ranch. My back was really hurting me, I couldn’t even really bend down, and I remember he took me into the training room, closed the door and closed the blinds. At the time I thought this was kind of weird but figured it must be okay. I thought he probably didn’t want to distract the other girls and I trusted him. I trusted what he was doing at first, but then he started touching me in places I really didn’t think he should. He didn’t have gloves on and he didn’t tell me what he was doing. There was no one else in the room and I accepted what he was doing because I was told by adults that he was the best doctor and he could help relieve my pain. Nichols also said that during the time the alleged sexual abuse took place, Nassar contacted her on Facebook and complimented on her looks.  “I was only 15 and I just thought he was trying to be nice to me,” she said. “Now I believe this was part of the grooming process I recently learned about.” She plans to submit her statement to an Ingham County, Michigan, court during sentencing for Nassar on Jan. 16, ESPN reports. Victims will be allowed to read impact statements on that date.  Nichols said that neither USA Gymnastics nor the U.S. Olympic Committee provided a “safe environment” for her and her teammates. She also said that Michigan State University “ignored complaints against Larry Nassar ... going back 20 years.” If the school had acted on these complaints, Nichols wrote, she “would never have been abused by him.”  “We were subjected to Dr. Nassar at every National Team Camp, which occurred monthly at the Karolyi Ranch [in Huntsville, Texas]. His job was to care for our health and treat our injuries,” Nichols said. “Instead, he violated our innocence.” Nassar’s attorneys, Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith, declined to comment to HuffPost. MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost that the university denies allegations that it covered up Nassar’s behavior in any way.  “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false. Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways,” Cody said. “As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.” A spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics also denied allegations that the organization covered up Nassar’s behavior in a lengthy statement to HuffPost.  “Contrary to reported accusations, USA Gymnastics never attempted to hide Nassar’s misconduct,” the statement read, in part. It also laid out a timeline of the FBI’s investigation into Nassar. “The suggestion by plaintiff’s counsel John Manly, who indicates that he is representing Maggie, that USA Gymnastics tried to silence athletes or keep the investigation secret to avoid headlines before the Rio Olympics and to protect Los Angeles’ Olympic bid is entirely baseless. USA Gymnastics kept the matter confidential because of the FBI’s directive not to interfere with the investigation.” The spokeswoman added that “USA Gymnastics is committed every day to ensuring our athletes are safe and further developing a culture of empowerment.” “The new CEO Kerry Perry is eager to meet and talk with Maggie and others who can help guide and lead these efforts,” the statement read. “USA Gymnastics has and will continue to take specific and concrete steps to prevent future abuse by vigorously enforcing the USA Gymnastics Safe Sport Policy. We are focused on further developing a culture that has safe sport as a top priority throughout the organization.” This post has been updated to include statements from MSU and USA Gymnastics.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Uber Settles Illegal Practices Lawsuit For Multi-Million Sum,"By Curtis Skinner SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc agreed to a $25 million settlement to end a civil lawsuit in California that accused the ride-sharing company of misleading customers about the strength of its background checks on drivers, prosecutors in Los Angeles and San Francisco said on Thursday. Uber must pay $10 million within 60 days, and the remaining $15 million will be waived if Ubercomplies with the terms of the agreement for two years, the San Francisco and Los Angeles County district attorneys said in statements. ""It sends a clear message to all businesses, and to startups in particular, that in the quest to quickly obtain market share laws designed to protect consumers cannot be ignored,"" San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said. Uber welcomed the settlement. ""We're glad to put this case behind us and excited to redouble our efforts serving riders and drivers across the state of California,"" it said in a statement. The case was filed in December 2014 by the two district attorneys, who alleged that Uber misled its customers about the strength of its background checks on drivers. The civil complaint also contended that Uber drivers work at airports without obtaining authorization, and in the case of San Francisco, charged a $4 extra fee to passengers traveling there, without paying anything to the airport. The agreement bars Uber from making untrue statements about its background checks and from charging airport ""tolls."" In addition, the company must ensure that its fare calculations meet state measurement standards. Uber said it has already made many of the changes, including no longer callings its service the ""safest ride on the road"" or calling its background checks ""the gold standard.""

New York City Just Recognized That It's Not Only Women Who Have To Change Diapers,"New York City Council member Rafael Espinal doesn’t even have kids. But when he saw a dad leaning over a bathroom sink in a mall in Queens changing his baby’s diaper, Espinal was aghast. It also got him thinking. He couldn’t help but wonder if the neighboring women’s restroom was better equipped for parents’ needs, and if moms were having an easier time with their babies. “It was terrible to see a father changing his child’s diaper on top of a public sink where hundreds of people wash their hands after using the restroom,” Espinal told HuffPost. “Parents should be changing their children’s diapers with a little more dignity, in a space that’s sanitary.” After doing some investigation, he found that while women’s restrooms are far more likely to have a changing table than men’s bathrooms, that isn’t even always the case. One woman told Espinal she often changes her baby’s diaper on the floor of a public restroom, for lack of a better option. Now both dads and moms in New York City won’t have to worry about changing their kids in unsanitary conditions, thanks to legislation Espinal introduced requiring all new developments with public restrooms to install changing tables in both men’s and women’s bathrooms, which the council approved on Monday. Older buildings that don’t currently have changing tables will have to install them if they undergo renovations. This will include movie theaters, restaurants and coffee shops. Even restrooms in nightclubs will now be required to have changing tables.  Espinal says it’s an affordable accommodation, as the changing tables themselves cost between $155 and $185. “It’s a low cost for a big benefit,” he said. He said he got no pushback from developers or lawmakers, even though the bill makes New York City the first major U.S. city to pass such legislation.  There are no national rules requiring buildings to install changing tables in bathrooms. Businesses that do opt to include them often only put them in the women’s bathrooms ― a tacit implication that changing dirty diapers is a “woman’s” job. Not only does this perpetuate archaic stereotypes, it also fails to account for a very substantial population of parents and caregivers — single dads, gay dads, dads who are out with their kids for the day without mom, grandfathers, male babysitters and other men charged with watching over babies in diapers. Espinal said he thinks the bill was so well received because notable figures have already opened up a national conversation around the issue. Frustrated with being unable to change his daughter’s diaper in a sanitary way in public, actor Ashton Kutcher launched a Change.org petition in 2015, urging businesses to install changing tables. “Families are diverse, and it is an injustice to assume it’s only a woman’s job to handle changing diapers,” Kutcher wrote in the petition at the time. “This assumption is gender stereotyping and companies should be supporting all parents that shop at their stores equally — no matter their gender.” Kutcher launched his mission after California Governor Jerry Brown shot down legislation in 2014 that would’ve accomplished what’s been dubbed “potty parity.” The governor vetoed two bills that would’ve required businesses to provide a baby changing station in a men’s room if one was provided in the women’s room. Businesses could’ve also opted to build one changing area in a restroom available to men and women. “This may be a good business practice, but not one that I am inclined to legislate,” Brown said at the time, according to the Los Angeles Times.   Last year, President Barack Obama brought a fresh perspective to the issue when he signed the Bathrooms Accessible in Every Situation Act. It required all federally owned buildings to have changing stations in both men’s and women’s restrooms.  Espinal hopes that after his bill takes off, that other cities will follow suit. And that it will help continue to encourage families to divide parenting tasks, when possible. “I don’t think the burden should just be on women,” Espinal said of changing diapers. “Men should step up and be on diaper duty as well.”",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
South Korea To Pay Record $2.64M For North Korea's Olympic Visit,"SEOUL - South Korea approved on Wednesday the use of a record 2.86 billion won ($2.64 million) to bankroll the cost of hosting hundreds of visiting North Koreans during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The Ministry of Unification said the funds will pay for the costs including accommodations and food for North Korea’s cheering squad, orchestra, taekwondo performers, journalists and other supporting personnel who had visited or are still in South Korea. Combined, they make a group of 424 North Koreans. South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited North Korea athletes, supporters and officials to the Olympics in an attempt to lower months of tension between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. A final number for the total payment of all the North Koreans who visited during the Olympics will be disclosed at a later time, said ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun in a briefing. Costs for hosting the high-level official delegation which included Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, were paid for separately from the government budget, Baik added without disclosing details. The International Olympics Committee will foot the bill for 22 North Korean athletes also in South Korea. Travel between the two Koreas has been impossible without the approval of both governments since the 1950-53 war that divided the peninsula and ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. Wednesday’s number far exceeds the 1.35 billion won that was used to pay for the 650 North Koreans who visited South Korea in 2002 for the Asian Games in the port city of Busan. The smaller amount in 2002 was partly due to the North Koreans’ cheering squad staying and eating on the ferry they had arrived in, a ministry official told Reuters who spoke on condition of anonymity. Inflation also attributed to the higher number. From the biggest portion of the 2.86 billion won, about 1.2 billion won will be used for accommodations and food, the official added. Roughly 1.0 billion won will be used to pay for entrance fees for Olympics venues and 100 million won has been set aside for transportation costs. Most of the North Koreans stayed at luxury hotels in Seoul and near the Olympics venue nearly throughout their visit, including the five-star Grand Walkerhill in western Seoul that has previously hosted celebrities including Paris Hilton and Michael Jackson. The budget for the North Koreans’ stay will be withdrawn from the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, part of the Unification Ministry’s spending budget. The fund was created in 1991 for North Korea-related expenditures and its total 2018 budget is 962.4 billion won.",SPORTS,SPORTS
White House Eliminates Cyber Czar Post After First Appointee Leaves,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator after President Donald Trump’s first appointee for the job departed last week, a spokesman for the National Security Council confirmed on Tuesday. “Today’s actions continue an effort to empower National Security Council Senior Directors. Streamlining management will improve efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and increase accountability,” NSC spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement replying to a question about the role’s elimination. The NSC’s two senior cyber policy directors sit near one another so will be able to coordinate matters in real time, Palladino said. Politico first reported earlier on Tuesday that the position had been scrapped, citing an email from an aide to national security adviser John Bolton that was sent to NSC employees, and provided to the newspaper by a former U.S. official. Rob Joyce, Trump’s first coordinator, left the White House on Friday and planned to return to the National Security Agency where he had worked previously. His expected departure was announced in April. The position was established during the administration of President Barack Obama and was aimed at harmonizing government policy on cybersecurity and digital warfare. Cyber policy experts, legislators and former officials had urged Trump to replace Joyce and not abolish the position. “I don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats,” Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Politico reported last week that Bolton was trying to eliminate the top cyber policy role. Joyce’s departure follows that of his boss, Tom Bossert, who oversaw his work on cybersecurity and was pushed out of the administration last month. The White House has seen a raft of departures since Bolton began his new role in April.",POLITICS,TECH
"Bob Ebeling, Challenger Engineer Who Forewarned Of Shuttle Disaster, Dead At 89","For three decades, retired NASA engineer Bob Ebeling blamed himself for being unable to stop the 1986 launch of space shuttle Challenger. He had warned that the shuttle might explode, and it did shortly after liftoff, killing seven crew members. In the final weeks of his life, however, thanks to an outpouring of support following a National Public Radio story in January on the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Ebeling, 89, finally found peace. ""It was as if he got permission from the world,"" Ebeling's daughter, Leslie Ebeling Serna, told NPR on Monday. ""He was able to let that part of his life go."" Ebeling died Monday in his home in Brigham City, Utah, after a prolonged illness with prostate cancer, NPR reported.  Challenger Engineer Who Warned Of Shuttle Disaster Dies https://t.co/ww6ibIcfYz Ebeling was one of five engineers at a NASA contractor then called Morton Thiokol who warned the space agency that cold temperatures predicted at the time of the launch could prove disastrous. The warning was ignored. The night before the launch, Ebeling reportedly told his wife, Darlene, ""It's going to blow up."" He told another daughter, Kathy Ebeling, that he had toyed with the idea of bringing his hunting rifle to work to threaten NASA not to launch, according to an article last month in The Washington Post. The next day, Ebeling watched in horror as the shuttle disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds after liftoff. He quit his job soon after that. And for the rest of his life, he carried guilt for not having done more. ""I think that was one of the mistakes that God made,"" Ebeling told NPR in January. ""He shouldn't have picked me for the job. But next time I talk to him, I'm gonna ask him, 'Why me? You picked a loser.'""  North Carolina resident Jim Sides was one of the hundreds of people who reached out after hearing Ebeling's story. ""God didn't pick a loser,"" Sides told NPR. ""He picked Bob Ebeling.""  With support from people around the country, Ebeling finally put his feelings of failure aside, his family members said. ""Thank you,"" Ebeling told NPR last month, when asked if he had anything to say to those who wrote him letters. ""You helped bring my worrisome mind to ease. You have to have an end to everything."" Ebeling also was a bird enthusiast. After leaving his engineering job, he devoted himself to restoring Utah's massive Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Monday.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Lonely Orca Lolita May Finally Be Going Home,"Lolita's life changed in an instant. One moment, she was swimming alongside her mother and extended orca family, learning how to catch her dinner and playing with her cousins. The next, she was being scooped up in a net, surrounded by men and the screams of her loved ones, not knowing that those anguished cries would be the last communication that she would have with her family. Lolita has been crammed inside a tank barely any larger than the length of her own body at the Miami Seaquarium for more than four decades.  Lolita's wretched world is the smallest tank in North America, and she hasn't even had the simple comfort of another orca's company since 1980.   But Lolita's torment may finally be coming to an end.  Two years ago, PETA, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and four individuals sued the National Marine Fisheries Service over Lolita's exclusion from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA protects members of the endangered Southern Resident orca population, the pod from which Lolita was kidnapped, from being harmed or harassed. Yet, despite being a member of the Southern Residents, Lolita has been denied the same protections that her wild family enjoys. After an agency review, the NMFS now agrees with PETA: Listing Lolita as a Southern Resident is warranted. This decision opens the door to her eventual release. PETA and the ALDF believe that Lolita's horrendous confinement conditions are prohibited by the ESA and will continue to work to have Lolita transferred to a coastal sanctuary in her home waters off Washington state's San Juan Island and, if possible, back into her family pod. In the wild, Southern Resident orcas often spend their entire lives with their mothers. Lolita recognized her pod's calls decades after being captured, and her 85-year-old mother is still thriving. Lolita has a lot of life to live and, after decades of deprivation during which her only activity was performing silly tricks, she deserves to be allowed to spend it in a natural setting.  A coastal sanctuary would give her greater freedom of movement and allow her to feel the tides and waves. But most poignant of all -- there is a very real possibility that she could reunite with her mother, aunts, cousins and siblings.  As so many now know after having watched the riveting documentary Blackfish, orcas possess sophisticated learning, problem-solving, and communication skills. Wild orcas live in large groups with complex relationships that include long-term friendships and alliances and cooperative networks. The sheer desolation and hopelessness that Lolita has experienced during her years of solitary confinement in a tank measured in gallons, with nothing to do but wait for the interminable days to pass, are unimaginable. The same can be said of her cousins trapped in misery in SeaWorld's tanks. But Lolita may now have the chance to experience the sheer joy of being reunited with those she was torn away from. And that's what PETA will continue to fight for.  The wrong that has been done to Lolita can never be forgiven, but it can―it must―finally be made right.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Michael Bloomberg Slams 'Epidemic' Of Political Lies As Danger To Democracy,"Billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg lashed out Saturday at the “epidemic of dishonesty” in politics that he said poses “one of the most serious dangers” to American democracy. During a commencement speech at Rice University in Texas, Bloomberg slammed the “endless barrage of lies” and “alternate realities” in national politics. “People are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts,” he said. Bloomberg didn’t single out President Donald Trump, though, he has called Trump’s candidacy a “con.” Bloomberg said Saturday that rampant dishonesty in politics is now “bigger than any one person ... than any one party.” He also held up presidents of the past — George Washington and Abraham Lincoln — as models of honesty.  “How did we go from a president who could not tell a lie to politicians who cannot tell the truth?” Bloomberg asked. “Today when we look at the city that bears Washington’s name, it’s hard not to wonder, ‘What the hell happened?’” Bloomberg sharply criticized “enablers” who tolerate and defend lies. Lies, he said, are only the start of a profound disturbance in U.S. politics. “When elected officials speak as though they are above the truth, they will act as though they are above the law,” Bloomberg said. That invites “criminality” in the “form of corruption [and] abuse of power.” “These abuses can erode the institutions that protect and preserve our rights and freedoms and open the door to tyranny and fascism,” he added.  Watch the rest of the speech is in the video above.

Bill De Blasio Tells NYPD To Stop Arresting People For Smoking Pot On The Street,"On a quest to fulfill his promise to end unnecessary arrests and racial disparity in marijuana enforcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has issued a new request to the city’s police: Stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public. Over the weekend, De Blasio told the New York City Police Department to issue summonses to pot smokers who were caught lighting up in public spaces instead of arresting them, reported CNN.  About 17,880 people were arrested in the city last year for low-level marijuana possession, including smoking in public. A startling 86 percent of those arrested were people of color. As The Guardian noted, De Blasio’s no-arrest recommendation won’t have an immediate impact on NYPD policy but is expected to influence a 30-day review of marijuana enforcement procedures currently underway at the NYPD. Phil Walzak, the department’s deputy commissioner of public information, told CNN that the issue is “certainly part of the review.”   “The working group is reviewing possession and public smoking of marijuana to ensure enforcement is consistent with the values of fairness and trust, while also promoting public safety and addressing community concerns,” Walzak said. Big news out of NYC. @NYCMayor preparing city for legalization of marijuana. As a first step, he’s telling the NYPD to stop arresting people for public pot smoking. https://t.co/PUJBr1A5zT De Blasio’s request marks the latest milestone in what observers have described as a striking shift in marijuana enforcement policy in New York City ― one sparked by a growing acknowledgment of the troubling racial gap in weed-related arrests. City-wide, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years, according to a New York Times analysis published last week. In Manhattan, the racial gap was even more striking; black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. Last week, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. pledged to stop prosecuting marijuana possession or smoking cases. “The dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.’s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system,” Vance said in a press release announcing the policy change. “The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals.” A day later, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office planned to reduce prosecution of low-level marijuana cases as well. The policy shift also appears to be spurred by an expectation of impending legalization. De Blasio, one of the few New York politicians who has voiced opposition to legalizing weed, announced that he will put together a task force to prepare the city for when marijuana is legalized. De Blasio said Monday that it’s “likely inevitable” that New York state will legalize the drug.  The legalization of marijuana in New York State is likely inevitable. Our city has to get rules in place before this happens and be prepared for the public safety, public health and financial impact. pic.twitter.com/5y40VlYhjG",POLITICS,POLITICS

Insurance Giant Aflac Reportedly Sued For Worker Exploitation,"Insurance giant American Family Life Assurance Co., known as Aflac, has been accused of workplace fraud, including claims that it exploited its employees with a high-pressure contractor scheme, according to a report Thursday on The Intercept news site. The report details complaints brought by current and former employees along with allegations raised in three previously unreported lawsuits.  In a statement to HuffPost, company spokesman Jon Sullivan said, “These allegations are baseless and we will be filing to have them dismissed.” Among the lawsuits’ claims are that the Fortune 500 company misleads new hires, exploits workers by classifying them as independent contractors and pressures associates with sales goals that lead them to sell policies without customer consent. The Intercept article published Thursday is reportedly the first installment in a series that will detail the lawsuits and the employees’ claims. Thursday’s report zeroes in on claims of worker exploitation, painting a picture of a contractor workforce desperate for avenues to income. The company has a practice of recruiting sales associates for contractor positions with promises of unrealistic earnings that only a tiny fraction of new hires manage to make, according to allegations outlined in the report. The company then reportedly pushes sales associates to sell policies to friends and relatives, as well as to target them for recruiting ― which is among the ways contractors make money. Associates are allegedly responsible for paying for their own office space and materials, as well as covering travel expenses for mandatory trainings. “On a daily basis, hundreds of people are receiving phone calls and emails that make you think it’s a job,” Martin Conroy, a nine-year Aflac veteran and lead plaintiff in one of the lawsuits, told The Intercept. “Those who figure out the scam get out of it. Some people go into financial ruin.”   The contractor economy has come under scrutiny in recent months as workers increasingly find themselves strapped in freelance and commission-based roles that don’t offer benefits or retirement funds. Uber, whose drivers are all considered contractors, paid two multimillion-dollar settlements in 2017 over complaints that it exploited workers.  Aflac has previously come under fire for selling policies without of the consent of customers. In 2012, the company agreed to pay a combined penalty of $1.6 million for their operations in Idaho, Minnesota and Missouri, and to submit compliance reports for three years. The settlement came after regulators found Aflac agents were selling duplicate health coverage and other policies consumers didn’t authorize. Aflac has roughly 10,000 salaried employees and earns over $20 billion in annual revenue. Recently, the company touted an overhaul to its 401(k) retirement savings program following the passage of the tax overhaul bill pushed by President Donald Trump. Aflac announced it would increase matches from 50 percent to 100 percent on salaried employees’ contributions of up to 4 percent of their pay. The company also said it would put $500 in every full-time employee’s 401(k) plan. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS

Sam Winkler. Winkler told The Deseret News that the diver, who hasn’t been identified by police, had entered an address into the car’s GPS and was looking on her phone for possible alternate routes. She “looked up just as the accident was about to happen,” he said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to the accident in a tweet Monday, saying that it was amazing the driver wasn’t more seriously injured. He also complained that the crash was being unfairly covered by the media, which he said often overly focuses on the Autopilot system while ignoring regular fatal highway accidents. What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU But Musk also admitted that the system “certainly needs to be better.” It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released. The semi-autonomous Tesla Autopilot system is supposed to maintain certain speeds, automatically brake when necessary and even change lanes. But Tesla emphasizes that “every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot, and must be prepared to take action at any time.” There was no indication that brakes were used when the car crashed. “Based upon witness information, the driver of the Tesla did not brake or take any action to avoid the collision,” Winkler said in his statement. The Tesla driver could face charges for failing to maintain the safety of her car, which would be a traffic infraction, Winkler told The Associated Press. Police are “currently working with technicians from Tesla to gather and review data stored within the vehicle, which may take several days,” said Winkler. Police have contacted the National Transportation Safety Board about the accident, but the NTSB has not yet launched its own investigation. The NTSB is already investigating the Autopilot system in a crash of a Tesla Model X in California in March in which the driver was killed. The NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are also probing a fiery crash of a Model S earlier this month in Florida that left two teens dead. Officials are reportedly investigating the emergency response to the serious battery fire that occurred.",TECH,TECH
Astronomers Have Detected Clouds Of Water Outside Our Solar System,"Astronomers say they have detected clouds of water outside of our solar system ― the first discovery of its kind. The remarkable find was located 7.2 light years from Earth on a brown dwarf ― a type of low-mass star ― called WISE 0855. It’s described as the coldest known object outside of our solar system and “strikingly similar to Jupiter.” “Its extremely low temperature makes it the first object after Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn likely to host water clouds in its visible atmosphere,” researchers stated in their report that was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters back in May. A team of astronomers at The University of California at Santa Cruz led the findings. NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) first detected WISE 0855 in 2014. It wasn’t until recent observations over 13 nights and about 14 hours, using Hawaii’s Gemini-North telescope and the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph, that researchers say they were able to get a clear enough picture of its infrared spectrum. The spectrum not only confirms, with “the best evidence,” that objects that cold would have water clouds but also provides new insight into this outer star as well as into Jupiter, Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said in a press release this week. “Our spectrum shows that WISE 0855 is dominated by water vapor and clouds, with an overall appearance that is strikingly similar to Jupiter,” Skemer, who co-authored the report, said. “Now that we have a spectrum, we can really start thinking about what’s going on in this object.” In addition to abundant water vapor, Jupiter and WISE 0855 also share similar temperatures — WISE 0855 being around 250 Kelvin or -9 degrees Fahrenheit, and Jupiter at 130 Kelvin. “WISE 0855 is our first opportunity to study an extrasolar planetary-mass object that is nearly as cold as our own gas giants,” Skemer said. The brown dwarf likely has a less turbulent atmosphere than Jupiter, however. That’s because it does not heavily absorb the toxic gas phosphine like Jupiter does, the report explains. It’s also about five times the mass of Jupiter. “The spectrum allows us to investigate dynamical and chemical properties that have long been studied in Jupiter’s atmosphere, but this time on an extrasolar world,” Skemer noted. The atmospheric findings appear to further blur the line between planets and brown dwarfs, which are often called “failed stars.” That’s because they are smaller than typical stars, though larger than planets, and therefore unable to sustain the nuclear fusion that makes regular stars shine, NASA explains on its website. This article has been updated with additional information on brown dwarfs. ",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

Iowa Governor Signs Nation's Strictest Abortion Ban Into Law,"Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) on Friday signed a law that would effectively ban abortions at six weeks of pregnancy, the nation’s strictest abortion legislation to date, setting up a legal battle with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The Republican-controlled state legislature passed the legislation, known as the “fetal heartbeat” bill, earlier this week, part of a wave of GOP-backed abortion restrictions introduced at the state level in recent years. The law requires women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound, banning the procedure if a fetal heartbeat is detected — typically at about six weeks into a pregnancy. It includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Medical professionals say that the law is far too stringent, as some women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks.  Earlier Friday, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU announced that they plan to sue Reynolds over the law’s constitutionality.  “I believe that all innocent life is precious and sacred,” Reynolds said at the Iowa State Capitol, where protesters could be heard during the bill signing. “If death is determined when a heart stops beating, then doesn’t a beating heart indicate life?” She acknowledged that the bill may not go into effect, pending a legal challenge. But Reynolds, who has described herself as staunchly pro-life, said: “I’m not going to back down from who I am or what I believe in.” Similar bans in other states have failed to take effect due to legal challenges. Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision, affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion until the third trimester, and the court later held that the right existed until fetal viability — typically at 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. Republicans and anti-abortion activists see Iowa’s law as an opportunity to chip away at the landmark ruling, and potentially take the legal battle to the Supreme Court. “This bill will be the vehicle that will ultimately provide change and provide the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade,” state Sen. Rick Bertrand (R) said earlier this week. “There’s nothing hidden here about the agenda.” Several dozen states have either passed or considered abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies policies on reproductive rights. Some states have also aimed to ban specific methods for abortions. This story has been updated with comments from Reynolds. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to include more details about the Supreme Court cases that affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion. ",POLITICS,POLITICS
How To Survive A Lightning Strike,"By Marc Lallanilla, LiveScience Assistant Editor: There's a club open to people from all around the world, but you wouldn't want to join: The club is exclusively for people who've survived a lightning strike. Lightning strikes kill about 24,000 people worldwide each year, and about 240,000 people are injured by lightning and survive. But even decades after being hit by lightning, survivors can continue to experience devastating long-term effects. Because a lightning strike zone can carry thousands of volts of electricity per square foot, severe nerve damage is common among survivors, who often report cognitive problems like memory loss, an inability to concentrate and personality changes. [Electric Earth: Stunning Images of Lightning] ""A lot of your routine — where did you put your keys, how did you file this, the multitasking stuff — pieces are missing out of it,"" Dr. Mary Ann Cooper, director of the Lightning Injury Research Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told NBC News in a 2009 interview. ""Their friends don't come around anymore. [They] don't understand jokes; they're socially inappropriate. All of those filters are kind of gone,"" Cooper said. Russ Chapman was walking across a parking lot in 1999 in Littleton, Colo., when lightning struck nearby, knocking him to the pavement. Since then, Chapman has been fired from jobs because he forgot to go to work, he often fails to eat and he suffers from health problems, including severe headaches, sleep problems and epilepsy. ""I know for a fact that people think I'm really weird,"" Chapman told NBC News. Survivors of lightning strikes often turn to Lightning Strike and Electrical Shock Survivors International, a group that provides information and support to victims and their families. How to survive a lightning strike The best way to survive, of course, is to avoid a lightning strike. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends people follow the 30/30 rule: If, after seeing lightning, you can't count to 30 before hearing thunder, get inside a building immediately (because the lightning storm is close). And don't go outside until 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder. Sheds, dugouts, bus shelters and other structures don't offer real protection and may actually be targets for a lightning strike. Instead, find a substantial building with wiring and plumbing that will direct an electrical charge away from occupants. It's safer to be in a vehicle than outdoors, provided it's a hardtop vehicle with the windows rolled up and not a convertible, according to FEMA. The metal frame of a vehicle will provide some protection (as long as passengers aren't touching any metal parts). Remember that rubber tires and rubber-soled shoes provide virtually no protection from lightning. In fact, many victims of lightning strikes are farmers in open fields riding tractors with rubber tires. If you're caught outdoors in a forest during a lightning storm, seek shelter in a low area under a dense growth of small trees. Avoid tall trees, since lightning tends to strike the tallest object in an area. If you're in an open area, go to a low area, like a valley or a ravine (but be alert for flash floods). If you're in a boat in open water, get to land as quickly as possible. And if you feel your hair stand on end, that means lightning is about to strike. As a last resort, immediately squat down on the balls of your feet, cover your ears with your hands (to minimize hearing loss) and put your head between your knees. Do not lie flat on the ground — it's best to minimize your contact with the ground, since an electrical charge will travel across the ground. If a person is struck by lightning, render assistance immediately — victims do not carry an electrical charge and cannot shock or hurt anyone. Lightning by the numbers A typical lightning flash contains about 300 million volts of electricity, or enough power to light a 100-watt compact fluorescent bulb for a year, according to the National Weather Service. In the United States, lightning strikes kill about 100 people each year and injure about 1,000, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). FEMA estimates that your chances of being struck by lightning are now about 1 in 600,000. Over the past 100 years, the rate at which people are struck has dropped substantially, as fewer people now work outdoors on farms or ranches. Florida experiences significantly more lightning strikes, deaths and injuries than any other state; NOAA recorded an average of 1.4 million lightning flashes per year in Florida. The New England region typically receives relatively few lightning strikes, and California, despite its size, receives just 85,000 lightning strikes in an average year, largely due to its mild coastal weather. And no other region of the world sees more lightning than central Africa: One small African town — the tiny village of Kifuka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is hit by lightning about 158 times each year.

This Adorable Labrador Retriever Loves Life Despite His Worsening Illness,"Elvis got left in the dark when his owners surrendered him. They gave up on him because he was having trouble seeing in the dark, and they soon learned he was going blind. Yet Elvis did not let being abandoned and losing his sight dampen his spirits. He's still got that same playful Labrador Retriever personality and spirit.   Elvis will go blind. It might not be today or a year from now, or even five years from now, but it cannot be stopped. He has a genetic disease that causes blindness called progressive retinal atrophy. The retina eventually weakens over time and causes severe sight loss, leading to total blindness. The first thing to go is night vision, which eventually phases into day vision loss and finally total blindness.   Although Elvis is still in the early stages of his condition, his fate is unavoidable. He will go blind. Elvis is still thriving even just a month later. He has been taken in by dog fosters named Dami and Greg. Elvis can still do everything a normal dog can do. He loves to play fetch, even if sometimes he has trouble locating the ball. He doesn't give up until he finds it! Going blind is not slowing him down.   Elvis has been working on his off-leash walking and uses his other senses, such as hearing and smelling, to guide him along the way. Currently in foster care, Elvis is searching for that special someone to call his own. He's looking for a home. Could you be looking for a dog like Elvis?

Our Badass Solar System Stole A Planet... Maybe,"There's an alien in our midst. An alien planet, that is. A new theory published this week suggests that the much-debated ""Planet 9"" isn't just a new member of our solar system, but rather an exoplanet. There is evidence that Planet 9 -- if it exists -- was kidnapped by the sun from its original host star. As indicated by a new computer simulation developed by astronomers at Lund University in Sweden, our sun may have pulled the exoplanet from its host star as the two passed each other.  ""Planet 9 may very well have been 'shoved' by other planets, and when it ended up in an orbit that was too wide around its own star, our sun may have taken the opportunity to steal and capture Planet 9 from its original star,"" researcher Alexander Mustill said in a news release. ""When the sun later departed from the stellar cluster in which it was born, Planet 9 was stuck in an orbit around the sun."" Earlier this year, researchers discovered the presence of a ninth planet by studying the orbits of icy objects beyond Neptune. They noticed anomalies in the objects' orbits and tracked them -- leading them to the gravitational pull of Planet 9. The existence of Planet 9 is still unproved, and images have ""remained elusive."" But astronomers haven't been twiddling their thumbs. They have come up with a few hypotheses for what the planet may look like. There's much more work to be done to figure out if this is just a theory or the real deal. So, until we know for sure, we'll just keep thinking our solar system is a master thief. ",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
MLB Sports Agent Accused Of Filming His Clients In The Shower,"The Major League Baseball Players Association is reportedly investigating an agent for allegedly filming his clients while they were showering. Jason Wood was fired Wednesday from his position as president of baseball for Career Sports Entertainment, which specializes in representing athletes and sports media personalities. The termination came after an unidentified baseball player showering at Wood’s home found a camera, according to the news site FanRag Sports. The player reportedly confronted Wood and then fired him as his agent. Multiple sources told the sports news outlet that Wood filmed clients in the shower. No names for the alleged victims have been released, but Wood’s clients include Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox, Riley Pint of the Colorado Rockies and Joey Wentz of the Atlanta Braves. Danny Martoe, president of CSE Talent, released a statement after Wood was fired: For over 32 years, CSE Talent has prided itself on our moral and ethical standards and have built a solid reputation within the industry. We take pride in working with people who represent these values. It’s unfortunate that CSE Talent aligned itself with someone who didn’t uphold these same standards and therefore we chose to terminate with cause Wood’s employment. The MLB Players Association hasn’t publicly commented on Wood, but confirmed to ESPN that he is being investigated. The New York Daily News reported that he has been suspended by the union pending that inquiry. HuffPost reached out to Wood, who did not immediately respond.",SPORTS,SPORTS

Now You Can Order Condoms With The Push Of A Button,"The candles are lit, Barry White's on the hi-fi and -- damn, you forgot a condom. If you live in fear of being unprepared, and are too lazy to buy condoms at the store, Amazon has a solution. The e-commerce site now offers a Dash Button that lets customers buy Trojan condoms simply by pressing a tiny gray button.  The prophylactic-summoning device is one of 80 new Dash Buttons Amazon rolled out Thursday. The buttons let Amazon Prime members order specific branded products, like Trojan condoms and Playtex Sport tampons, with as much effort as it takes to swipe right on Tinder. To use Dash, you just connect the device to your Amazon account, set it up on your smartphone and press the button to place an order. Delivery times vary, but Amazon says Dash items ship as fast as anything else ordered with Prime.  Amazon launched its first Dash Buttons exactly one year ago. The company now offers more than 100. Other new additions include Slim Jim and Red Bull buttons -- because why not? The condom button seems like it could actually improve people's health. Cases of sexually transmitted infections in the U.S. have been rising in recent years, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control. When people have unsafe sex, 20 percent of the time it's because neither partner has a condom, according to Trojan's condom compliance survey. Dash Buttons cost $4.99 for Prime members. But Amazon refunds customers after their first purchase, so the buttons end up essentially costing nothing.  While the company isn't saying how successful the buttons have been, it says orders purchased using Dash buttons increased 75 percent in the last three months, per Tech Crunch.  Perhaps sales will rise as people's passions do.",TECH,TECH
Google's Self-Driving Cars Will Honk At You If You're Not Paying Attention,"Google's self-driving cars are getting smarter. Prototype vehicles are now able to recognize when honks are appropriate and even modulate how they use the horn, the company said in its most recent monthly report.  ""As our honking algorithms improved, we’ve begun broadcasting our car horn to the world,"" the report said.  ""If another vehicle is slowly reversing towards us, we might sound two short, quieter pips as a friendly heads up to let the driver know we’re behind,"" it continued. ""However, if there’s a situation that requires more urgency, we’ll use one loud sustained honk."" Driverless cars may be the future, but we're not getting there all at once. Even after we've moved from prototypes to the real deal -- with autonomous vehicles sharing highway space next to the carpool lane -- we'll have plenty of human drivers on the road. So robot drivers will need to be able to get along with us. The new developments from Google essentially mean that its self-driving cars can alert you to dangerous situations -- in theory, making roads a bit safer. If you were to swerve into a lane occupied by Google's car, it would honk at you, hopefully calling you to attention and making the rest of your commute a bit more focused. Sure, no one likes a car horn -- but this sounds pretty good to us. H/T Transport Evolved",TECH,TECH
New Haven Marches For Science,"It was not a particularly beautiful day today in New Haven, Connecticut. But everyone who gathered ― some 2,000 strong ― for the March for Science knew in advance that beautiful weather was unlikely.

Despite the weather, I might have been dry and comfortable today courtesy of feathers, fur, or wool- had I been a duck, otter, or sheep- respectively. Those are adaptations, all, products of evolutionary biology and natural selection- which we understand courtesy of science.

Instead, I was comfortable and dry courtesy of Gore-Tex- a product of science.

Our mission at today’s rally and march, I suggested, was to build bridges to those not marching with us- our neighbors, and coworkers, and cousins. Our mission was and is to build bridges that expand our reach and route of march, not burn bridges, and thus constrain them. I proposed reminding those not marching with us, every chance we get, that the ACT of every tweet- sending organized electrons through cyberspace- trumps the content of any tweet repudiating the basic merits of science. But for science, no one would find their way to cyberspace in the first place.   Every tweet is a vote for the products, power and practicability of the scientific method- and I asked those assembled to tweet, and retweet that. I ask those of you amenable to do the same.  Some may be concerned that science is arrogant, and too sure of itself. But nothing could be further from the truth. Science is incredibly humble. It is riddled with doubt, and constantly prone to self-deprecation. It is all the stronger for it.  As Bertrand Russell said: “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.”  Good scientists are wise enough to know how much we don’t know. The reason the best scientists sometimes lose out to hucksters in the court of public opinion is that the hucksters feign certainty, while the true scientists forever hedge. Science can be wrong, and acknowledges it can be wrong. But when it is wrong, what shows us the error, and the correction- is more science, not denial or alternative facts. Science is falsifiable, and verifiable- but always by more science, not by those who find the findings of science inconvenient. It is despite the humility of science and the assault of doubt that truths are established beyond the shadows: gravity is real, climate change and our complicity in it are real, immunization saves countless lives, the earth is billions of years old, our solar system is heliocentric, evolution is real- and on a daily basis, science is repudiated by those using the endowment of its methods. It is not a given, incremental advance of science for which we marched- it is for the methods that fuel the advance, allowing all the while for the route to truth to be both hard and tortuous. So I asked those gathered today – and I ask you ― to remind those not marching for this cause that the power, practicality, and proof of the scientific method are literally at everyone’s texting fingertips ― presidential and otherwise. -fin David L.

What's Diversity Got To Do With It?,"By Ruben Cantu Over the past five years, the landscape of the Austin tech startup scene has changed. Some would argue the change has been for the better. But if we look closely, we can still see many opportunities for growth. You have probably heard about Austin being the number one city for startups, beating out Silicon Valley for a couple of years now. We are definitely the next boomtown, and yet we are also still the most economically segregated community in our country. These two stats get thrown around a lot, but what do real entrepreneurs think about the direction of Austin and its tech scene? Well, it depends on whom you ask.  In a recent conversation with my black entrepreneur friends and colleagues, there was a sense of hopelessness and a lack of attachment. Some feel that if they did not have other ties to the city they simply would not have chosen to start a business here. I asked why they feel this way, and their response was that Austin simply lacks the environment, vibe and opportunities they feel they need to be upwardly mobile. More importantly, they find it hard to imagine themselves in roles of privilege of power because it's not an image that is commonly portrayed here. All of that depresses me — and not because I can deny its truth. As a Latinx male, I understand that this is an ongoing crisis. And yet some people simply don't see it as a concern. If they do acknowledge this crisis, it's in their peripheral view and not a priority. No one is blatantly keeping the black community out of Austin, or the tech scene for that matter. But all of us are complicit in what is happening. We as a community have not done enough in either fostering a pipeline of talent to step into leadership roles or in making this place welcoming to black people researching Austin as a place to settle. When they see Austin, they see the statistics and the ongoing story (which lies in truth, but still hurts) that Austin has one of the fastest-dwindling black communities.  For a city that portrays itself as a liberal bastion, we fall closer to being tolerant than truly progressive. Atlanta, Toronto, Chicago, New York and, for that matter, Los Angeles have more overall diversity and diversity in technology.  So the conversation then evolved to the point of action. Some of my friends told me: “Ruben, if you want to make that one of your battles, go right ahead. But, honestly, we are tired. We are tired of having to always fight and explain and push for positions. We get tired of hearing that we are not qualified enough or that we don't have enough merit when plenty of those jobs were filled because of who people know and not a merit-based system.” I tried to tell my friends that while I understood why they feel this way and that their feelings are warranted, I also believe that if we give up fighting, move away or just ignore the problem, then nothing will change. The response was, “Well, you can make that your cause and bear the flag, but we don’t see anything changing soon.” This then got me to think about three things.  1. The talent we are losing to other cities because of this issue.  If we are indeed supposed to be the Social Innovation Capital of the World, a vision that I promoted way back in 2010 and that caught traction, we sure are failing to be inclusive and bring in the best talent to do it.  2. The rate at which this trend is accelerating and the future of our city if we do nothing to change it.  We can point to our leaders and hold them accountable, but even as Mayor Adler is doing his part with this Institutional Racism Report and task force, 90 percent of the work must be done by regular citizens like you and me. 3. What this says about Austin as the supposed “best city for startups” and the precedent this sets for our children.  What kind of city do we want to leave for them? We still deal with the ramifications (even though, as Mayor Adler said, we are not responsible for them) of the 1929 Master Redistricting Plan for Austin, which forced our black and brown communities to move under the threat of cutting off their utilities.  After much deliberate thinking, I developed a response that I believe many of us would support: 1. We must keep talking about this issue and bringing it front and center.  Capitalism was never built with a moral compass in mind; that's the role of responsible citizens. Just as institutionalized racism is based on policies and systems created by flawed humans that must now be rectified, we need to rise to a higher level of consciousness. We don't do this by preaching but by deliberate and inclusive action.  2. We need a strong network of allies from the white community.  As much as we all hate to make this an ethnic or racial topic, we cannot ignore this. None of us got to choose the color we were born into, but we can choose to help eradicate this social construct. If you are comfortable and you feel that this does not affect you, then this article is specifically for you, because we are all responsible. I fear this statement will make people defensive because they will think they are being attacked personally, but that’s far from the purpose.  Words like these are often hard to say, because by pointing out facts it may feel like we're pointing fingers and blame. I urge you to stay with me and understand it is not about placing shame, but rather about creating awareness that leads to positive action. No one white person is solely responsible for the actions of their ancestors. In fact, some also had their own struggles against injustice. It's important not to fall into the fallacy of comparing suffering, which is futile. But we must accept that collectively - side by side and hand in hand - we must push for this to change.  We were given a baton from our ancestors to make this world better. What are we doing with this opportunity, and can we say we did the best we could if we never take deliberate action to change this? 3. Change is often touted as inevitable but taking a long time.  I refuse to believe this. If we really want to change, we leap into action immediately. What takes longer is accepting the need for change. This is true on a societal level, too. People will defer action on a tough issue until it is no longer bearable. We knew slavery and racial segregation were wrong, but we chose to look away until it became an unbearable issue. We knew that restricting the LGBT community from the basic human rights we all enjoy was wrong, but they had to campaign a long time before this country finally started taking action.  But change happens instantly when we want it to. When we’re in crisis mode the urgency of now is undebatable. We move first and rationalize later. We have rationalized for decades but we all don't feel the urgency. Those in power believe it can wait and those who are being affected can no longer afford to wait. If we push change down people's throats, it will get viciously rejected. So we need a collective strategy that includes everyone and addresses their concerns and fears. That is the conversation I want to have and build upon with our leaders. Our world is better because of diversity and inclusiveness. We become more competitive and have more opportunities to innovate and evolve. Social diversity leads to higher returns for communities and corporations, just as biodiversity often leads to greater value and resiliency for the entire ecosystem in nature. Business leaders may not know where to start or how. That is OK; they can look toward other companies for guidance. More tech companies are releasing annual diversity reports. Even if their numbers are dismal, at least they’re starting a larger conversation. The next step is to have our corporate leaders and civic leaders stand together, listen to the voice of the people and state that they will commit to increasing the diversity of their communities and that they will make long-term financial investments to help address this talent gap.  So what does diversity have to do with it? Everything! If you want to be competitive, conscious, resilient and generate a lot of revenue for your company and community, the clock is ticking. Great organizations like E4 Youth, Latinitas, Con Mi Madre, Breakthrough Austin and the LevelUp Institute are working on creating a diversity pipeline from an early age. But if business leaders and citizens don’t support programs like these for the long haul, we will not see transformation. We must also not forget about the civic leaders and activists who are sidelined and disregarded. We have young talent in our city like Naji H. Kelley, founder of Blnded Media Michael Henderson, founder of @doingdev, or Ainee Athar with Fwd.us and who also step up and give this issue a voice. We need more young people like them.  Here's one final thought. If the state of Texas leads the nation, then Austin must lead Texas. As we go, so goes the nation in many aspects. We are in the city of opportunity, but is that opportunity available to all? You get to choose that with your dollar, vote and voice.  Choose wisely and act with intention.  Later this fall we'll present some new findings in Cincinnati at this years Love Summit, where we'll show that tomorrow's world depends on businesses that are conscious of their impact, intentionally inclusive and treat people with the highest dignity. If we can collectively accept that business is about loving people first then their founders will end up making large profits and prosperity for their communities.

French Biathlete Clinches Gold In One Nail-Biter Of A Finish,"When it comes to clinching gold at the Winter Olympics, sometimes every millimeter counts. French biathlete Martin Fourcade captured the gold medal ― the fourth in his career ― in the men’s 15km mass start competition on Sunday in a dramatic neck-and-neck finish at the games in Peongchang, South Korea.  The 29-year-old crossed the end line just barely ahead of Simon Schempp of Germany. Both men, in a last-ditch dive, stretched toward the line but it was Fourcade who managed to cross it first, passing Schempp by just a few millimeters, the BBC reported. That’s less than an inch. #Biathlon at it's best! pic.twitter.com/vW50vrnzHn Both recorded the same time of 35 minutes, 47.3 seconds. Biathlon combines skiing and shooting, with the men’s 15km event featuring five laps around a 3km course and four shooting rounds  Bronze went to Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway. The race’s victor took more than a minute to declare, as judges reviewed replays that ultimately showed Fourcade’s left boot crossing the line before Schempp. Fourcade, who placed second in the event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, initially thought he lost to Schempp. He was seen angrily hitting one of his ski poles on the ground. “Four years ago in Sochi I lost by only three centimeters, so I thought the story was repeating again. Tonight it’s incredible,” he later told reporters. Fourcade’s victory made him France’s most successful Winter Olympian of all time. Fourcade won gold last week in the men’s 12.5km pursuit and two gold and two silver medals at the 2014 games. This story has been updated with details on replays of the the race and comments by Fourcade.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Leonardo DiCaprio Donates $3 Million To Oceana,"When it comes to his animal spirit, it looks like Leonardo DiCaprio sees himself as more of a shark than a wolf.  The ""Wolf of Wall Street"" star's eponymous foundation recently donated $3 million to Oceana, one of the largest nonprofits dedicated to ocean advocacy.  The grant, which will be distributed over three years, will be used to protect threatened habitats and marine species (such as sharks) as well as to advocate for responsible fishing measures, including the effort to ban California drift gillnets.  DiCaprio is a well-known environmentalist (he's also donated money to help protect tigers and elephants), and his foundation is ""dedicated to protecting Earth’s last wild places and fostering a harmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world.""  “Protecting our planet’s oceans and the marine species that call it home is one of the most pressing sustainability crises facing humanity today and a moral imperative that we must acknowledge,” DiCaprio said in the press release.  We couldn't agree more. But what about the wolves? ",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Trump's Crackdown On Immigrant Parents Puts More Kids In An Already Strained System,"Tens of thousands of children from Central America are apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border each year, straining the government system caring for minors traveling to the U.S. without their parents. Now Donald Trump’s administration is stretching the system even further.  Until recently, families that illegally crossed together generally faced deportation proceedings in civil court. But as of this month, the Trump administration is following a blanket policy of referring for prosecution all people who cross illegally. The change means that authorities send parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Services and their children wind up in the same agency as minors who came to the U.S. without their parents ― sometimes without their parents being able to locate them.  White House chief of staff John Kelly told NPR this month that once separated from their parents, children “will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.”  That “whatever” is the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes custody of unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, who by law may not be immediately deported. The ORR is charged with finding a sponsor for the children to live with ― ideally, a parent.  Even before Trump administration officials announced the new policy, the ORR was showing signs of strain.  While the number of children apprehended while traveling without their parents is lower than it was at its peak in 2014, border agents picked up more than 26,000 unaccompanied minors since October. The ORR recently lost track of nearly 1,500 children once in its custody and in 2014 released some minors to traffickers.  “They’re crippling an already overwhelmed system,” Michelle Brané, the director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, said of the administration’s decision. “You take that situation in which children are released, and then there’s little to no follow-up, and add hundreds and hundreds of children ― thousands of children, eventually ― and you’re multiplying the level of the problem.”  Last month Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families, which includes the ORR, told a Senate subcommittee that the federal government was unable to locate 1,475 children who had been released from its custody when it called to check in on them from October the end of 2017. An additional 28 had run away, and 52 were living with someone other than their initial sponsor, he said.  Once an unaccompanied minor is placed with a sponsor, “he or she ceases to be in the custody of the U.S. government, and all HHS-provided subsistence — food, shelter, clothing, health care and education — ends at that point, and the child becomes the responsibility of his or her parent, guardian or sponsor,” a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.  The ORR typically calls to check in with sponsors 30 days after releasing a child, but that’s it. The children have little in the way of other help; the government does not provide immigrants with attorneys for removal proceedings, even if they’re children, leaving them to navigate a complicated legal process on their own. The ORR has already come under scrutiny from some members of Congress, particularly after it was revealed that it released several minors in 2014 to sponsors who ended up being traffickers. HHS and the Department of Homeland Security were supposed to have a joint plan for dealing with unaccompanied minors by February 2017 but failed to meet their deadline. The agencies told the Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigations last month that they would complete their plan by July 30, according to the office of Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who chairs the subcommittee and has pressed for quicker action.  Now the government could be facing an influx of children, many of them likely to be younger than the average age of minors who traveled without parents. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is taking steps that could deter some sponsors from coming forward to take in children. The ORR previously checked fingerprints of potential sponsors to conduct background checks, and now it has a memorandum of understanding to share that information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which could have a chilling effect for undocumented parents already in the U.S. whose children came to join them.  Parents in government custody are now in many cases unable to locate their children. After the parents serve time for the misdemeanor offense of illegal entry ― typically a sentence of only a few days and often no more than time served ― they’re then transferred to ICE for deportation. With limited access to phones and no right to a public defender, parents might not be able to find out where their children are.  The ORR worked with the DHS to locate parents in immigration custody in about 700 cases since October 2017, according to an ORR spokesperson.  Even before the Trump administration concretized the immigration changes this month, family separation at the border sparked legal challenges. In February the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Congolese woman who crossed at a port of entry with her daughter. The two were separated despite crossing legally. The ACLU is asking a federal judge to issue a nationwide injunction barring the federal government from separating families at the border, arguing that it violates the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause.  “This is as horrific a policy as I’ve seen in 25-plus years doing civil rights work,” Lee Gelerent, an attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project, told HuffPost. “No child should be sent to these government facilities if they don’t have to be, especially with all these problems in the ORR system.” Those cases are now becoming more common. At a recent immigration prosecution hearing in Tucson, Arizona, a 36-year-old Guatemalan woman named Alma Jacinto asked through her assigned lawyer when she could be reunited with her two children, who were separated from her when they crossed the border. Neither the magistrate judge nor the prosecutor knew the answer.  In another case, reported by the Houston Chronicle, Esteban Pastor was deported to Guatemala after U.S. authorities separated him from his 18-month-old child. He was unable to locate the child after he returned to Guatemala.  “God only knows how many of the kids will get reunited or how they will be reunited when the parents are prosecuted,” said Judy Greene, a co-author of Indefensible: A Decade of Mass Incarceration of Migrants Prosecuted for Crossing the Border. “This is devastating.” ",POLITICS,POLITICS
You Can Use Your Personal Bitmoji In Snapchat Now,"Snapchat just got a little bit more personal. The popular social app now allows users to stick their Bitmoji characters into snaps, messages and stories, Snapchat announced in a blog post Tuesday morning. If you’ve created a Bitmoji character already, you can link your two accounts and start right away ― otherwise, you’ll need to download the Bitmoji app and create a new avatar. We were only able to get the functionality to work on an iPhone this morning ― not our Android device ― though a Snapchat representative told The Huffington Post it should be enabled on both operating systems. Make sure your apps are updated if you’re interested in checking the new features out, and maybe check again later if you’re having trouble. We also got an error message when we first tried to link the two accounts on iOS, though closing out of the apps and trying again fixed the problem. Snapchat bought Bitmoji for $100 million in March. If you’re not up to speed, Snapchat is a social media app that’s surged in popularity across demographics the past couple of years. It allows users to send “snaps” ― full-screen images plastered with words or “stickers” ― to their friends on a casual basis (the snaps automatically delete themselves after they’ve been viewed). Users can also post to a more public “story” that lasts for a full 24 hours, and, as of earlier this month, use a new “memories” feature to make their content even more permanent, if they want.  Bitmoji, meanwhile, is a popular app that allows users to make cartoon representations of themselves that they can post to various social networks or send in text messages.  The fusion of the two, especially considering Snapchat’s reputation as a more “personal” place to talk to your friends than Facebook, is basically the chocolate-meets-peanut-butter of social media startups.  Now go forth and do something interesting:",TECH,TECH
Papa Tossed! Pizza Chain Orders Up New CEO.,"Papa John’s CEO is papa gone. The popular pizza chain, known for featuring founder “Papa” John Schnatter in its commercials, announced Thursday that Schnatter will step down as CEO at the beginning of next month. The decision comes amid falling sales, which Schnatter blamed last month on protesting National Football League players, who he said were hurting profits.  Despite Schnatter having issuing a clarification and apology for the comments, his dismissal means the storm came full circle ― no matter how you slice it. While the pizza chain’s future was temporarily tossed in the air, it seems to have landed in loyal hands. The company will promote longtime employee and former president Steve Ritchie to the position of CEO. “I am so proud of Steve,” Schnatter said in a company statement announcing the change. “He has excelled at every job he’s ever held at Papa John’s – from being an hourly customer service rep, to a delivery driver, store general manager, director of operations, franchisee and most recently President.” For the good of Papa’s shareholders, hopefully Ritchie can still deliver the dough.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Colorado Flooding: Did Climate Change Play A Role In Recent Disaster?,"From Climate Central's Andrew Freedman: The Boulder, Colo. area is reeling after being inundated by record rainfall, with more than half a year’s worth of rain falling over the past three days. During those three days, 24-hour rainfall totals of between 8 and 10 inches across much of the Boulder area were enough to qualify this storm as a 1 in 1,000 year event, meaning that it has a 0.1 percent chance of occurring in a given year. At least four people have been confirmed dead so far, and thousands have been evacuated from their homes and businesses. All along Colorado’s Front Range from Denver northward to Boulder and in nearby areas, small creeks have been transformed into raging rivers, and surges of water, mud, and debris have blasted their way through canyons, at one point trapping a firefighter on a treetop before being rescued. Numerous longstanding records have been smashed, including the all-time 24-hour rainfall record in Boulder.  “This is clearly going to be a historic event,"" National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini said in an interview. “The true magnitude is really just becoming obvious now.”  Uccellini said the Weather Service has initiated a review of its performance leading up to and during the event. Although the potential for heavy rainfall was in the agency's forecasts a week in advance, he said, “Clearly the magnitude of the rainfall and the repetivieness of it in some critical areas was not pinpointed” well ahead of time. Uccellini said that this event will be the new historical high water mark for many affected rivers and streams. In a technical discussion on Thursday, the NWS described the rainfall amounts as ""biblical."" On average, Boulder gets about 1.7 inches of rain during September, based on the 1981-2010 average. So far this month, Boulder has received 12.3 inches of rain. This smashes the record for the wettest month ever in Boulder, which was set in May 1995 when 9.59 inches of precipitation fell — and September isn’t even half over! Not only that, but the average yearly rainfall in Boulder is 20.68 inches. This means that Boulder picked up well over half its annual precipitation in just a couple of days.  This comes on the heels of a summer when Boulder experienced a moderate drought according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. This summer also featured the Colorado's most destructive wildfire on record. During the past couple of weeks, the weather across the West has featured both an active Southwest Monsoon and a broad area of low pressure at upper levels of the atmosphere, which has been pinned by other weather systems and prevented from moving out of the region. It was this persistent low pressure area that helped pull the moisture out of the tropics and into Colorado. Signs point to the tropical Pacific being the source of the abundant moisture according to the University of Wisconsin’s Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies. From there, the moisture plume was transported northeastward, over Mexico and into Texas, and then northward by upper level winds. This tropical air mass, which is more typical of the Gulf Coast than the Rocky Mountains, has been forced to move slowly up and over the Front Range by light southeasterly winds. This lifting process, known as orographic lift, allowed the atmosphere to wring out this unusually bountiful stream of moist air, dumping torrents of rain on the Boulder area for days on end. There was also broader-scale lifting of the air that resulted in heavy rain in areas of eastern Colorado and western Kansas as well. According to meteorologist Jeff Masters of Weather Underground, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, or ""precipitable water,"" as measured by a weather balloon over Denver on Sep. 12, reached record values for the month of September.

Credit: CIMSS The National Weather Service (NWS) said in an online discussion on Friday that the amount of precipitable water in the air over Colorado is still at record levels for this time of year, which is an indication that the potential for heavy rainfall remains high. Colorado has a long and tragic history of flash flood events, most notably the Big Thomson Canyon Flood in 1976, which resulted in 139 deaths after a slow-moving thunderstorm dumped a foot of rain in just four and a half hours, causing a massive wall of water to blast through the canyon. According to the NWS forecast office in Denver/Boulder, the river stage at the North Fork of the Big Thompson river so far has exceeded the Big Thompson Flood of 1976 by more than one foot. 
Enough rain fell between Sept. 10-12 to turn 2012 from one of Boulder's driest years into a year that, so far, is rivaling its wettest on record. Credit: Dennis Adams-Smith/Climate Central. Did Climate Change Make This Event More Likely? It will take climate scientists many months to complete studies into whether manmade global warming made the Boulder flood more likely to occur, but the amount by which this event has exceeded past events suggests that manmade warming may have played some role by making the event worse than it would have otherwise been. Considering that this flood event occurred in the backyard of some of the world's top climate researchers, it is likely that this event will be closely researched. Boulder is home to several major weather and climate research institutions, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Earth System Research Laboratory, both of which were forced to close due to flooding. Extreme rainfall events have become more frequent across the U.S. during the past several decades in part due to manmade global warming. Increasing air and ocean temperatures mean that the air is generally carrying more water vapor than it used to, and this moisture can be tapped by storm systems to yield rain or snow extremes. Trends in extreme precipitation events vary by region, though, and in general the biggest increases have taken place in the Midwest and Northeast. However, most parts of the U.S. have seen an increase in extreme precipitation events, according to the draft National Climate Assessment report that was released this past January. The report goes on to note that in the future, ""increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for most U.S. areas.” 
The increase in the most extreme precipitation events (99th percentile) since 1950. Credit: Climate Central/National Climate Assessment An increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events is expected to take place even though annual precipitation amounts are projected to decrease in the Southwest. Colorado sits right along the dividing line between the areas where average annual precipitation is expected to increase, and the region that is expected to become drier as a result of climate change. That may translate into more frequent, sharp swings between drought and flood, as has recently been the case. Last year, after all, was Colorado's second-driest on record, with the warmest spring and warmest summer on record, leading to an intense drought that is only just easing.  Although the overall climate of the Southwest may become drier over the coming decades, a greater proportion of the rain that does fall could be in the form of heavy precipitation events. “... Heavy downpours will account for increasingly large portions of the total precipitation in regions such as the Southwest, where total precipitation is projected to decrease,” the report said. Previous studies have found that global warming made some extreme rainfall and flood events more likely, including major flooding in the U.K. in 2000. Some recent work has found mixed evidence about whether warming played a significant role in other flood events, though, such as the Queensland floods in Australia in 2011-12. The biggest and most consequential rise in flood risk may take place outside the U.S., in countries that don’t have as much of a capacity to bounce back from such disasters, however. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on June 9 found that flood frequency as well as the number of people at risk of inundation from flood events are both likely to increase as the world continues to warm, but most especially in developing countries in Southeast and South Asia.

"6 Sandy Hook Families, FBI Agent Sue Alex Jones For Defamation","Alex Jones may start to learn that his actions as the conspiracy-minded host of Infowars have consequences.  Family members of six victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, filed a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against Jones, who for years has peddled the false conspiracy theory that the massacre never happened. FBI agent William Aldenburg, who was among those responding to the shooting in which 26 people were killed, joined the suit, which was obtained by HuffPost. The suit also names Jones’ Infowars contributor Wolfgang Halbig and Halbig’s associate, Cory Sklanka. It was filed by attorney Josh Koskoff of the Bridgeport, Connecticut-based law firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder.  Part of Jones’ false narrative has been that interviews of Sandy Hook parents conducted by CNN were fake. “Folks, we’ve got video of Anderson Cooper with clear blue-screen out there,” Jones said in a 2014 Infowars broadcast. “He’s not there in the town square. We got people clearly coming up and laughing and then doing the fake crying. We’ve clearly got people where it’s actors playing different parts for different people ... covering up everything.” The suit lists numerous videos made by Jones and articles he has written, including one story published just after the shooting titled “FATHER OF SANDY HOOK VICTIM ASKS ‘READ THE CARD?’ SECONDS BEFORE TEAR-JERKING PRESS CONFERENCE.” The story had a video attached to it titled “Sandy Hook Shooting Exposed As a Fraud.” In a May 2014 broadcast, Jones asserted that former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg knew about the shooting before it happened. This, of course, is a lie. “The whole thing, you’ve got ’em jumping the gun ... that Bloomberg was saying get ready the day before, get ready to fundraise on mass shootings ... had a false start, didn’t you Bloomy?” Jones said in a broadcasted conversation with Halbig, according to the suit. Jones’ sidekick, Halbig, has called the Sandy Hook victims “crisis actors” and has also questioned whether the Pulse nightclub and Parkland mass shootings in Florida took place, according to Koskoff. Halbig, a 70-year-old former police officer and school administrator, harassed the victims and made more than 22 trips from his home in Florida to Connecticut to deliver “highly controversial testimony” to the Newtown Board of Education, the suit said. His many visits led police to warn that he would be charged with harassment unless he stopped contacting residents, according to the suit. In a 2015 Facebook post, Halbig floated a false claim that a father of a Sandy Hook victim and Aldenberg were the same person. He’s called the shooting a “scam” and “the biggest illusion ever portrayed by Homeland Security and FEMA,” the new suit says. The suit joins a long list of others filed against Jones this year. The parents of two Sandy Hook children filed one in April alleging they have been harassed by conspiracy theorists because of Jones. Earlier that same month, Jones was hit with a defamation lawsuit for misidentifying the Parkland school shooter. And in March, he was hit with a defamation suit for promoting a conspiracy about a witness to the Charlottesville, Virginia, Unite the Right rally last year in which counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed by an alleged white supremacist. Koskoff said in a statement that Jones “saw an opportunity” to profit off the Sandy Hook tragedy. “He went on a sustained attack that has lasted for years, accusing shattered family members of being actors, stating as fact that the shooting itself was a hoax and inciting others to act on these malicious lies,” Koskoff said. “He knew his claims were false but he made them anyway to further a simple but pathetic goal: to make money by tearing away at the families’ pain. This lawsuit seeks to hold Alex Jones and his financial network accountable for those disgraceful actions.” This story has been updated with details from the lawsuit.  6 Sandy Hook Families, FBI Agent Sue Alex Jones For Defamation by sebastian on Scribd",POLITICS,POLITICS
World's Atmospheric CO2 Spiked To A Record Last Year: UN,"A grim United Nations agency report reiterates a warning that climate scientists have been touting for months: At the rate we’re going, it’ll be near-impossible for the world to meet Paris climate targets unless drastic action to curb greenhouse gas emissions is taken swiftly. The World Meteorological Organization’s annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, published Monday, describes how concentrations of global atmospheric carbon dioxide increased at a record rate in 2016 — reaching the highest level in 800,000 years of observable data.  “Globally averaged concentrations of CO2 reached 403.3 parts per million in 2016, up from 400.00 ppm in 2015 because of a combination of human activities and a strong El Niño event,” the organization says. “Concentrations of CO2 are now 145 percent of pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.” Greenhouse Gas Bulletin: atmospheric levels of CO2 surged at a record speed in 2016 to 403.33 ppm in 2016 because of #ElNiño, #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/kJDyNaWtXV The 3.3 ppm bump is significantly higher than the average annual increase over the past decade of 2.08 ppm, noted The Guardian, adding that the rise was also “well above the previous big El Niño year of 1998,” when CO2 concentration rose by 2.7 ppm.  “The numbers don’t lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed,” said Erik Solheim, head of U.N. Environment, in a statement. “What we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency.” CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere hit new high in 2016 because of #ElNiño & #climatechange, even though new emissions are levelling out pic.twitter.com/U0EAQmkVOF CO2 emissions from human sources have slowed in recent years — but carbon dioxide lingers and continues to accumulate in the atmosphere for centuries, so the concentration of the greenhouse gas has continued to balloon, according to the World Meteorological Organization report. CO2 has been the primary driver of climate change since the Industrial Revolution. Gavin Schmidt, NASA’s chief climate scientist, explained to Climate Central last year that even if CO2 emissions somehow plunged to zero tomorrow, the level of carbon dioxide “probably wouldn’t change much” and would only start to fall “in a decade or so.” Recent studies have suggested that humans need to do more to slash the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as the ability of natural carbon sinks to slurp up CO2 weakens. Studies have shown that carbon sinks, like oceans and the biosphere, may lose their efficacy in absorbing CO2 as temperatures rise. There’s also evidence suggesting that forests are being destroyed at such a rapid pace that they may be emitting more carbon dioxide than they mitigate. “Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement. “Future generations will inherit a much more inhospitable planet.”  The report was published in the days leading up to COP23, the U.N. climate change conference scheduled to take place in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17. Reacting to report on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did not mince words: The @WMO report sends an urgent message: Wake up world. We are killing our planet.

Giuliani Calls Comey A 'Baby' For Defending FBI Agents Against 'Storm Trooper' Insult,"Rudy Giuliani lashed former FBI Director James Comey as a “sensitive little baby” Thursday after Comey defended the bureau’s agents after Giuliani called them “storm troopers,” The Washington Post reported. Among a number of stunning comments by Giuliani in his Fox News interview Wednesday night, he compared FBI agents to Nazi storm troopers for raiding the office of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen last month and collecting documents and computers. Agents, provided with court-issued warrants, were legally authorized to do so. Cohen is being investigated for bank fraud and possible campaign finance violations. Comey tweeted Thursday that there are no “stormtroopers” in the FBI — “just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth.” Comey said the country would be better off if “our leaders” tried to emulate them instead of “comparing them to Nazis.” I know the New York FBI. There are no “stormtroopers” there; just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth. Our country would be better off if our leaders tried to be like them, rather than comparing them to Nazis. Giuliani, who just joined Trump’s legal team, responded to the tweet in an interview with The Washington Post, calling Comey a “sensitive little baby.” He added, without offering details: “He should be sensitive, because he’s been caught lying over and over again.” Bolstering his growing reputation as Trump’s new insult man, Giuliani on Fox also called Comey a “disgraceful liar” and “very perverted man” — again, without explaining what he was referring to. In defending Trump on Fox, Giuliani appeared to support suspicions that the president fired Comey a year ago to short-circuit an investigation into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to swing the election in Trump’s favor. Giuliani said the president “fired Comey because Comey would not — among other things — say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.” So “he fired him and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’” Giuliani has traditionally enjoyed strong ties with the FBI, both as a U.S. attorney and as New York City mayor. After Comey reopened the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails just before the election, Giuliani indicated he learned that members of the bureau weren’t happy with the initial conclusion to not pursue her use of a private email server from both former and “active” agents.  WATCH: Rudy Giuliani admits that Trump campaign had advanced warning from the @FBI about Comey's letter. pic.twitter.com/7AOJopgQOB Giuliani’s former law firm, then called Bracewell & Giuliani, was also general counsel to the FBI Agents Association, which represents 13,000 current and former agents. Giuliani left the firm in early 2016.",POLITICS,POLITICS
San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich Won't Discuss Victory After Shooting,"San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich isn’t shy about speaking his mind on matters beyond the court, whether it’s about President Donald Trump or racial inequality.

Not after 26 people lost their lives when a gunman opened fire on First Baptist Church in nearby Sutherland Springs, Texas. And he politely but firmly told reporters so.  Quick Popovich reaction... basketball not important after what occurred today in Texas #Spurs pic.twitter.com/8Iu7iWNJGy “We won a basketball game but considering what’s gone on today, it’s pretty meaningless,” he said. “When you think about the tragedy that those families are suffering, it’s just inconceivable and impossible to put your head around. So I think talking about basketball tonight is probably pretty inappropriate. You guys have a good night.” One of Popovich’s players was particularly vocal in addressing the tragedy before the game. Pau Gasol, a native of Spain, said that “something has to change.” “At what point do we say enough?” Gasol, a veteran center, asked, per MySanAntonio.com. “I don’t know. Again, I know it’s a delicate subject but I hate for innocent people to get killed and for families to pay that price and carry that burden for the rest of their life. It’s sad. It’s really sad. It needs to be addressed. I hope that it is. I hope we see change and progress to prevent this from happening so often.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
How Successful People Stay Productive And In Control,"TalentSmart has tested more than a million people and found that the upper echelons of top performance are filled with people who are high in emotional intelligence (90 percent of top performers, to be exact). The hallmark of emotional intelligence is self-control—a skill that unleashes massive productivity by keeping you focused and on track. Unfortunately, self-control is a difficult skill to rely on. Self-control is so fleeting for most people that when Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed two million people and asked them to rank order their strengths in 24 different skills, self-control ended up in the very bottom slot. And when your self-control leaves something to be desired, so does your productivity. When it comes to self-control, it is so easy to focus on your failures that your successes tend to pale in comparison. And why shouldn’t they? Self-control is an effort that’s intended to help achieve a goal. Failing to control yourself is just that—a failure. If you’re trying to avoid digging into that bag of chips after dinner because you want to lose a few pounds and you succeed Monday and Tuesday nights only to succumb to temptation on Wednesday by eating four servings’ worth of the empty calories, your failure outweighs your success. You’ve taken two steps forward and four steps back. Since self-control is something we could all use a little help with, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people do to keep themselves productive and in control. They consciously apply these twelve behaviors because they know they work. Some are obvious, others counter-intuitive, but all will help you minimize those pesky failures to boost your productivity. 1. They Forgive Themselves A vicious cycle of failing to control oneself followed by feeling intense self-hatred and disgust is common in attempts at self-control. These emotions typically lead to over-indulging in the offending behavior. When you slip up, it is critical that you forgive yourself and move on. Don’t ignore how the mistake makes you feel; just don’t wallow in it. Instead, shift your attention to what you’re going to do to improve yourself in the future. Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you’ll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn’t easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can’t do this when they’re living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can’t allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward. 2. They Don’t Say Yes Unless They Really Want To  Research conducted at the University of California Berkeley shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects of over commitment. 3. They Don’t Seek Perfection Emotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know it doesn’t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward excited about what you’ve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future. 4. They Focus On Solutions  Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions which hinder self-control. When you focus on the actions you’ll take to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won’t dwell on problems because they know they’re most effective when they focus on solutions. 5. They Avoid Asking “What If?”  “What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking “what if? will only take them to a place they don’t want—or need—to go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking. 6. They Stay Positive Positive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain’s attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don’t lose focus. 7. They Eat File this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you’re having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control. So, if you’re having trouble keeping yourself out of the company candy bin when you’re hungry, make sure you eat something else if you want to have a fighting chance. 8. They Sleep I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and maintaining your focus and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present, which are a major productivity killer. Being busy often makes you feel as if you must sacrifice sleep to stay productive, but sleep deprivation diminishes your productivity so much throughout the day that you’re better off sleeping. When you’re tired, your brain’s ability to absorb glucose is greatly diminished. This makes it difficult to control the impulses that derail your focus. What’s more, without enough sleep you are more likely to crave sugary snacks to compensate for low glucose levels. So, if you’re trying to exert self-control over your eating, getting a good night’s sleep—every night—is one of the best moves you can make. 9. They Exercise Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. If you’re having trouble resisting the impulse to walk over to the office next door to let somebody have it, just keep on walking. You should have the impulse under control by the time you get back. 10. They Meditate Meditation actually trains your brain to become a self-control machine. Even simple techniques like mindfulness, which involves taking as little as five minutes a day to focus on nothing more than your breathing and your senses, improves your self-awareness and your brain’s ability to resist destructive impulses. Buddhist monks appear calm and in control for a reason. Give it a try. 11. They Ride the Wave Desire and distraction have the tendency to ebb and flow like the tide. When the impulse you need to control is strong, waiting out this wave of desire is usually enough to keep yourself in control. When you feel as if you must give in, the rule of thumb here is to wait at least 10 minutes before succumbing to temptation. You’ll often find that the great wave of desire is now little more than a ripple that you have the power to step right over. 12. They Squash Negative Self-Talk A big final step in exercising self-control involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it’s time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you’re doing and write down what you’re thinking. Once you’ve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity. You can bet that your statements aren’t true any time you use words like “never,” “worst,” “ever,” etc. If your statements still look like facts once they’re on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook. Putting These Strategies to Work The important thing to remember is you have to give these strategies the opportunity to work. This means recognizing the moments where you are struggling with self-control and, rather than giving in to impulse, taking a look at these strategies and giving them a go before you give in.

Elon Musk's Tweet Gives Creepy Insight Into Future Of Humanoid Robots,"Elon Musk’s predictions about robots is the stuff of nightmares.  Twitter user Alex Medina captioned a promotional video of Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot doing backflips and jumps in an obstacle course with the panicked caption: “We dead.” Musk responded to Medina by essentially telling him to buckle in for a lot more terrifying features to these humanoid robot advancements.  “This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you’ll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams…” Musk wrote.  This is nothing. In a few years, that bot will move so fast you’ll need a strobe light to see it. Sweet dreams… https://t.co/0MYNixQXMw Uh... The Atlas robot is marketed as the “world’s most dynamic humanoid,” but even that impressive advancement might soon be eclipsed by artificial intelligence. The Tesla CEO followed up his creepy comment with a warning about the future of leaving such technology unchecked. “Got to regulate AI/robotics like we do food, drugs, aircraft & cars,” Musk tweeted. “Public risks require public oversight. Getting rid of the FAA [wouldn’t] make flying safer. They’re there for good reason.” So Musk is basically backing up every horror movie theory about artificial intelligence and robots ever. And this isn’t the first time the tech mogul has warned about these types of advancements. Musk said in September that artificial intelligence will probably be the spark that ignites a world war.  “China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science,” Musk wrote on Twitter in September. “Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo.”  Well, hopefully Will Smith can protect humanity in the upcoming robot apocalypse.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated the robot did frontflips in the video. It did backflips.",TECH,TECH
"You Get What You Pay for (Perjury, in This Case)"," Reposted from Eye on the Amazon Having virtually all the money in the world often means you can buy silence, you can buy time, and you can buy lies. Chevron has demonstrated this time and again in its decades-long battle to evade accountability for deliberately dumping 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the Ecuadorian Amazon. The problem is that this time what Chevron has bought is a bag of lies in the form of false testimony from a thoroughly disreputable source, and they aren't able to hide the price tag. In the ongoing saga of Chevron's scorched earth legal strategy, last month disgraced former judge Alberto Guerra testified in support of the company's most explosive allegations – that the judgment against Chevron was ghostwritten by the plaintiffs and that his efforts to seek bribes were partly on behalf of Judge Nicolas Zambrano, who issued the historic $19 billion final judgment in the Ecuadorian environmental litigation. Somehow, Chevron expects the court (and the public) to believe that a man who has admitted to fixing cases and accepting bribes throughout his career as a lawyer and a judge is being honest this time, despite receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from Chevron for his testimony. And everything depends upon his word, as the supporting ""evidence"" that he's presented is laughably incomplete (he claims that his computer died, and that's why he has essentially nothing to back up his story). For months Guerra worked with Chevron to prepare his testimony –  and yet it was STILL full of gaping holes and contradictions. Amazon Watch was there in court and couldn't help wondering how anyone could take Guerra seriously. Of course, there's no jury in this trial – something Chevron worked very hard to guarantee – just a wall of stone-faced lawyers whose fat paychecks depend upon Judge Kaplan accepting Guerra's testimony as credible (or at least convenient). It doesn't take a law degree to see that a man who's known for being a ""liar for hire"" and who has admitted that Chevron is paying him more than 20 times his prior salary is NOT a credible witness. But Chevron is operating in a legal realm of its own creation. It's one where you can sue the victims of your own environmental abuses, where you can prevent consideration of any actual evidence in the case, and now where you can pay witnesses whatever you like to give their ""testimony"" on your behalf.  These unethical maneuvers have not gone unnoticed by the legal community. Erwin Chemerinsky, a noted legal scholar and dean of the University of California Irvine School of Law stated: ""That Chevron and its counsel have crossed the line here cannot seriously be debated. If a party or its counsel were permitted to pay a testifying witness for physical evidence, beyond the reasonable value of that evidence, and to pay the witness a salary in exchange for an agreement to testify, there would be little left of the rule against compensating fact witnesses. That is precisely what has occurred here."" The Ecuadorians have now moved that all of Guerra's fraudulent testimony be stricken. Remember, this was the best Chevron could do on this case. They know that they can't discuss the abundant evidence of their misdeeds – it still sits in toxic pools by the hundreds in Ecuador – so they've pinned their feeble accusations of a sinister conspiracy on claims of a corrupt legal process. I think they have managed to uncover some corruption, however. So when will Chevron and their legal team be brought before a court to answer for paying a confessed charlatan to commit perjury? I work as the Director of Outreach and Online Strategy at Amazon Watch. The views expressed in this column are mine alone. Amazon Watch is proud to accompany the Ecuadorian communities affected by Chevron's deliberate contamination in the Amazon for over a decade. During the course of our lengthy campaign, Amazon Watch has also allied with the legal team responsible for one of the most important environmental victories in history by achieving a $9.5 billion judgement against Chevron affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ecuador in a 222-page decision that meticulously documents the company's environmental crimes, fraud, bribery, and subterfuge during the long eight-year trial.

Uber Halts Self-Driving Car Fleet After Crash In Arizona,"Uber is suspending its entire self-driving car program while it investigates a crash involving one of its vehicles in Tempe, Arizona. The ride-hailing company confirmed the crash after a photo was posted on Twitter showing an Uber SUV Volvo on its side next to another dented car with broken windows. BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach pic.twitter.com/5NCF2KG0rW No one was injured, Tempe police told Bloomberg News. The Uber vehicle was not found to be fault, as another car failed to yield the right of way. “There was a person behind the wheel” of the Uber car, police spokesman Jose Montenegro told the publication. “It is uncertain at this time if they were controlling the vehicle at the time of the collision.” All autonomous cars are currently required to have humans behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if necessary. There were no passengers in the back seat, according to Uber. Uber began testing its cars in Arizona after its self-driving program was shut down in California late last year because the company had failed to obtain the proper permits. California cracked down after Uber autonomous cars were seen breezing through red lights. The company agreed to comply with the state’s rules and once again began testing its cars in San Francisco earlier this month. The Tempe crash is more bad news for the company, which recently has been hit by a litany of accusations, including complaints of sexual harassment and sexism in the workplace. Uber used the software tool Greyball to dodge taxi enforcement officials, The New York Times reported earlier this month. And Waymo, the autonomous-car company owned by Google parent company Alphabet, sued Uber earlier this year for allegedly stealing designs for sensor technology. Dashcam footage also recently captured company co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick berating a new driver, prompting Kalanick to issue a statement saying, “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.”  Uber President Jeff Jones resigned last week after just six months on the job.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Watch This Deep-Sea Crab Get An Icy Surprise,"By Becky Oskin, LiveScience Staff Writer: In the ocean's inky depths, crabs scavenge for meals by tracking vibrations from sound and movement. For one crab, that meant a stream of icy methane bubbles seemed like a potential meal — until the methane froze onto its claws and mouth. Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) watched the scene unfold in August 2011 on video shot by a remotely operated vehicle. The researchers were offshore of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, where naturally occurring methane seeps from the seafloor through cracks and faults, said Peter Walz, an MBARI research technician who was on the expedition. ""It was pretty obvious that the crab was intent on going to the gas vent, but we had no idea what he was going to do or why. The crab was doing his own investigation of what we were investigating,"" Walz told LiveScience. [Watch the curious crab] The deep-sea crab's methane mustache was a result of the chilly temperature and high pressure at the methane seep, about 4,130 feet (1,260 feet) below sea level. When methane gas escapes from submarine sediments at this depth, the bubbles have a frozen skin called methane hydrate, with gas trapped inside, Walz explained. This skin was the first layer of methane ice on the crab's claws. But any agitation in the gas stream, such as when the crab waved its claws in the bubbles, transforms the methane gas into methane hydrate, Walz said. ""The hydrate forms more readily with increased agitation or shaking, such as the movements of the crab,"" Walz told LiveScience. After the crab scraped off the methane hydrate and wandered away, the researchers continued their survey of the methane seep, called the Bullseye Vent. Their research helped confirm that large pockets of methane gas can change the shape of the seafloor. Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Hate Autoplay Videos? New Mac OS Will Let You Block Them On Safari.,"Mac computer users will be able to block videos from playing automatically on the upcoming version of Safari, an Apple executive announced Monday at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The feature is one element of Apple’s updated operating system, called High Sierra, Senior Vice President Craig Federighi told the audience in San Jose. The update will replace the MacOS Sierra system that runs on millions of laptop and desktop computers. Company executives also announced Monday that Apple Pay will soon allow person-to-person payments through the Messages app on iPhones. Apps from PayPal, Venmo and others already allow people to transfer money digitally. The feature will debut as part of the iOS 11 platform that powers iPhones and iPads. The autoplay blocker will likely prove popular with users who get annoyed by videos that instantly begin when a webpage loads. But it could hamper businesses, like this website, that generate revenue via video views. Safari has autoplay blocking in High Sierra for video and audio. Big cheer around the room Safari will block autoplay video as of MacOS High Sierra. Happy about that, even if it kinda sorta pays the bills 'round here. The latest system will also feature enhanced browsing privacy that will limit ads that pop up based on a person’s search history, Federighi said. Google, one of Apple’s chief competitors, has also been working on ad-blocking technology.  The company intends to introduce a new version of its Chrome browser next year that will prevent ads that interfere with users’ experience from appearing on certain websites, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.",TECH,TECH
People Google Some Weird Questions About Clinton And Sanders,"If you need further evidence that this is the weirdest election in American history, look no further than Google. Trends data from the search engine reveal that Americans have some oddball -- and decidedly unpolitical -- queries about the Democratic candidates. For each candidate, the most popular search query is about which actor plays them on ""Saturday Night Live."" Relevant! But things get worse for Clinton. The data show that people want to know what Donald Trump calls her. They also ask what she weighs -- obviously a policy-related question frequently lobbed at male candidates, right? In California, where a primary is happening Tuesday, Googlers ask how old Clinton is and whether she plans to drop out of the election. (She has secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination, the Associated Press reported Monday, so that's probably not happening.) Beyond the SNL question, people want to know if Sanders is rich and whether he's still running for office. (Ouch.) In California, they ask if he's a vegan. Google data is an interesting way to get a candid look at what people are wondering. Think about how you use the search engine: Perhaps you've Googled a medical symptom you were too embarrassed to ask someone about? Or maybe you've double-checked some gossip on a celebrity. The filter between your brain and that little search bar is pretty thin, is the overall point.  As for whether the vegan base will ultimately fall in line behind Clinton -- only time will tell.",TECH,TECH
"When It's Time To Take Your Business Elsewhere, Here's The Right Way To Exit","Can we talk about the end? It’s that moment when you say, “That’s it. I’m taking my business elsewhere.” And you mean it. It’s the moment when you conclude your interests and a company’s interests are no longer aligned, to put it delicately. It’s time to go. There’s a right way and a wrong way to leave. I know because I watch people do it all the time, every day. Heck, I’ve had it done to me both on a professional and, sadly, personal level. I have a lot of experience with this. A recent American Express survey suggests consumers are trigger-happy. After only a single instance of poor customer service, 37 percent of respondents bail out on a company. Another 58 percent say they’d be willing to endure “two to three” instances of bad service. In other words, for 95 percent of American consumers, businesses get three chances at most to get customer service right. Here’s what you need to know: There’s a right way and a wrong way to split. Almost no one ever hears about the right way, but the wrong way sometimes goes viral. “You’re already familiar with this story?” asks Andrew Pollis, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. “It’s about a guy who tried to cancel his account with Comcast and was met with a super-aggressive customer service representative who wasn’t really offering any inducements but also wouldn’t let the customer go.” That’s not how to go your separate ways. Pollis says it’s common with companies in certain industries, like cable TV. “That interaction provides an opportunity to rescue business from an impending cancellation,” he explains. “So they have developed interceptive measures. In some instances, a telephone representative is armed with the tools to offer an inducement, like a discounted rate, to entice the consumer not to leave.” So how do you say “good-bye”? Know why you’re leaving. When David Waring, the co-founder of FitSmallBusiness.com, decided to cancel his email marketing software, he knew exactly why. “We found it more complicated to use than originally advertised, and more expensive than another less complicated but just as powerful option,” he says. “So we decided to cancel.” Some customers don’t know why they’re leaving. Maybe they’re just mad at the company, or at themselves, for something over which the business doesn’t even have any control. When a retention specialist phoned Waring, he was ready with an explanation ― and a step-by-step process for winning back his business. (It didn’t work, and he left.) Use logic, not emotion. Worth emphasizing is that emotion ― anger or resentment toward the company ― can ruin a perfectly orderly departure. “I advise my clients to leave only for goal-achieving reasons, not tension-relieving reasons,” says Debra Benton, an executive coach. “And then do it in the same manner you’d like it done to you: with logic, not emotion; with notification, not just walking out the door. Give them the respect and courtesy you’d like to get.” It’s worth noting that roughly a quarter of customers who leave end up coming back at some point, so Benton says anger will not serve you well in this situation. Get out legally (if you can). And that may not be easy, especially if you’re under contract with the business. You’ll have to read the paperwork and find a legal way to cut your ties. And you might have to get creative. “Assuming you signed a contract, that means they have to provide goods and services to you at the time you exchange money,” says Jameson Drew, who runs a property management company in Los Angeles. “Did said contractor perform sub par, was anything illegally done, or did you just get a better price elsewhere?” If you can get out legally, do it. If not, you may need to negotiate your departure. That’s a topic for another time. Don’t burn bridges. People change and companies change. A bad company today may improve, and when it does, you might want to bring your business back. “If the company is important to me and there are significant personal or working relationships with the company, then it’s worth investing in closing the relationship carefully,” says Don Maruska, author of the book “How Great Decisions Get Made.” In business, as in life, there’s no point in alienating the person or company you’re separating from. Keep it professional. If you feel as if this has turned into a relationship column, give yourself a pat on the back. It is all about relationships. “Human beings sit on the other side of the table,” says Will Bachman the co-founder of Umbrex, a global community management consultants. “And it is a small world.” Some day, he notes, you may want to work with the company again. “So, when terminating a relationship, do it with respect and play the infinite game. That is, act as if you’ll be interacting with the other party countless times in the future,” he says. Good advice. And as someone who has been terminated, fired, dissed and dumped over a lengthy career as a consumer advocate, I can only underscore, highlight and emphasize the wisdom of those words.

Kaepernick’s 'Loss' With His Collusion Grievance Is Our Gain,"Former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick will win and lose with the collusion grievance he’s filed against the NFL. The win is easy. The NFL season is nearly half over. Several starting NFL quarterbacks have gone down, or have been banged around to the point where their playing status is touch and go, game by game. The most recent to go is Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers. Yet, not one of the 32 NFL teams has expressed any real interest in giving Kaepernick a tryout. A handful of owners, GMs and coaches have gone further and said either he wouldn’t fit in their offensive scheme or flatly told the truth, and said, he’d be a “distraction.” He was simply not worth the hassle. So, Kap really didn’t have anything to lose in filing his grievance. He’s out. He’s effectively blackballed. The odds that he can actually prove that two or more owners got together exchanged texts, emails or left some paper trail in which they agreed that they’d do everything they could to make sure he never suited up again on their team or any other NFL team because of his views and protest is slim to none. However, he doesn’t really need to uncover that smoking gun document to make his case that 32 NFL owners have slammed the NFL door to him. He’s a player at the peak of his career, had relatively good stats, won many games as a starter and could help several struggling teams as a back-up. The exclusion of a player with those credentials is unprecedented in the NFL. Still, it does not meet the sky-high bar to prove collusion but it reinforces what many in the sports world, many NFL players, and many in surveys and polls have said about him. The grievance is a public relations coup that no amount of money could buy. The complaint forced the NFL to scramble and issue pious statement after pious statement that it respects individual freedoms, including the right of players to protest. It challenges the owners to do more than pay lip service to backing social justice causes and the fight against racial injustice. It forced NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to swiftly squash media speculation that the NFL owners at their scheduled meeting would clamp down on the player’s anthem protests by making it mandatory that they stand at rapt attention during the playing of the anthem. This all can be chalked up largely to Kap’s grievance. The other win is that it stiffens the sternum of the NFL players association in their coming contract talks with NFL owners about pay, revenue sharing, health benefits, with special emphasis on the concussion issue. The grievance will also bolster the association’s demand for loosening owner controls on what players can and can’t say and do as NFL players. This is huge given that the NFL is not, and never has been, a democracy. It’s an owner’s autocracy in which the players in times past have been expendable and readily replaceable cogs in a revolving door with little to no say so about the NFL rules and playing conditions. The grievance put a major chink in the NFL’s seeming untouchability on player rights. This is all great for the players, and their association. It’s great for Kap in that he can claim much of the credit for shaking up the league, much of the sports establishment, and even causing a significant number of NFL and sports fans to think hard about police abuse and racial injustice in society. Ironically, this is where he loses. He will continue to be vilified, scorned, and ridiculed by many more in the sports establishment and other NFL fans and sports enthusiasts as being the one who ruined football and sports by ramming those inconvenient issues and politics into the sports arena. With the likelihood good, that he will not win his complaint, he will not get the millions in pay and damages that have bandied about as the pay-off if he did prevail. Even worse, he has effectively killed any slender, remote chance that he ever had of playing again in the NFL. He will be the Curt Flood of pro football; a man who took a stand, won a victory for the players, but who paid a heavy personal price for that victory. Some say that Kap knew the risk he was taking when he took his stand, and that he was prepared to pay the price for it. That may or may not be the case, but what is undeniable is that Kap still wants to play football, NFL football and has dropped many hints about that. So, it’s facile to say the least, that he had any desire to be the Rosa Parks of sports.

"California Moves To Let Schools, Co-workers 'Red Flag' Dangerous Gun Owners","Lawmakers in the California Assembly voted Monday to advance a bill that would authorize employers, co-workers and school personnel to request the temporary confiscation of guns from individuals determined to pose a danger to themselves or others. The legislation, AB 2888, would build on California’s existing “red flag” law, passed in 2014 following a deadly shooting spree in Isla Vista. The 22-year-old gunman in that case had reportedly exhibited a number of warning signs before killing six people, and then himself, in the rampage. The current red flag law gives family members, roommates and law enforcement officers the power to petition the court to remove firearms from individuals who have displayed dangerous behavior. Judges then hold a hearing to determine whether to order the gun owner to surrender their firearms and stay away from all guns, typically for a year, although the restraining orders can be extended beyond that based on additional evidence. The new bill would expand the list of people who can file for such restraining orders to include a subject’s employer and co-workers and the staff of a high school or college that the person has attended in the last six months. “We’re grappling with this issue of gun violence as a nation,” bill sponsor Assemblyman Phil Ting (D) told HuffPost. “I’ve never said this is a panacea, but it’s just one of many solutions we have to offer.” The state’s courts have issued around 200 restraining orders to prevent gun violence since the original law went into effect in 2016, according to Ting. He said his bill would provide additional opportunities to catch troubling behavior. “Once you move away from home and you’re an adult, you may not spend time with your family,” said Ting. “You may not have much interaction with law enforcement, but chances are if you’re working, you see your co-workers every day for eight-plus hours a day, and you’re with them not just in the work environment but socially.” Ting pointed to the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, as a case in which a red flag law ― and specifically this sort of broader statute ― might have been able to save lives. Although the suspect in that shooting, a 19-year-old former student at the high school, had attracted the attention of local authorities on numerous occasions before his attack, school staff had also reported concerning behavior as far back as 2016. Florida is among the nine states with a red flag law and one of the four to have ushered through legislation since the Parkland shooting. In 2016, Ting filed a similar bill to broaden California’s red flag law, following the mass shooting in San Bernardino, which began at an office holiday party. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) ultimately vetoed the legislation, calling it “premature to enact a further expansion” even as the initial law was just going into effect. A year later, Ting’s San Francisco area district faced its own mass shooting when a disgruntled UPS employee walked into his workplace and fatally shot three colleagues, before killing himself. When it comes to school safety specifically, restraining orders aimed at stopping gun violence are only part of the equation, said Amanda Wilcox, legislative chair of the California chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. She noted a California law that holds parents criminally liable if they leave their gun where a child can access it and mentioned other resources, like the Brady campaign’s Speak Up hotline, that allow students to anonymously report violent threats made by their peers. “Practices and law and policies that make homes safer would also keep schools safer,” she told HuffPost. Wilcox said she supports Ting’s bill and suggested that the relatively few restraining orders issued in the past two years under the original law show that it isn’t being overused, as opponents argued it would be. “The standards of proof are high in the law,” she said. “It probably needs to be used more, but also under the law it’s supposed to be a last resort if there’s not another way to remove the guns.” With more time to educate Californians on how the red-flag process works, Wilcox said she’s hopeful these restraining orders will be able to keep more guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. “What I don’t want is a case where it could have been used and should have been used and wasn’t, and someone is dead because of that,” she said. AB 2888 passed in a 48-25 vote largely along party lines. The state Senate is expected to consider the bill in the coming weeks.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Uber Resumes Self-Driving Car Program In San Francisco After Crash,"By Gina Cherelus (Reuters) - Driverless vehicles operated by Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] were back on the road in San Francisco on Monday after one of its self-driving cars crashed in Arizona, the ride-hailing company said. Uber’s autonomous vehicles in Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, remained grounded but were expected to be operating again soon, according to a spokeswoman for the company, who refused to be identified. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” she said in an email. Uber’s San Francisco program is currently in development mode. It has two cars registered with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, but is not transporting passengers. The spokeswoman said because of this, the company felt confident in putting the cars back on the road while it investigates the collision in Arizona. On Friday, Uber suspended its pilot program in the three states. A human-driven vehicle “failed to yield” to an Uber vehicle while making a turn in Tempe, Arizona, said Josie Montenegro, a spokeswoman for the city’s police department. “The vehicles collided, causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto its side,” Montenegro said in an email. “There were no serious injuries.” Two “safety” drivers were in the front seats of the Uber car, which was in self-driving mode at the time of the crash, Uber said on Friday, a standard requirement for its self-driving vehicles. The back seat was unoccupied. Photos and a video posted on Twitter by Fresco News showed a Volvo SUV flipped on its side after an apparent collision involving two other, slightly damaged cars. Uber said the images appeared to be from the Tempe crash scene.   (Reporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Dan Grebler)",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Weinstein Company To Seek Bankruptcy After Last-Ditch Sale Talks Collapse,"The Weinstein Company reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection after last-ditch talks to sell the studio collapsed. The company board of directors said late Sunday that bankruptcy is the only “viable option” after negotiations “concluded without a signed agreement,” according to Reuters. The board said it “has no choice but to pursue the only viable option to maximize the company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.”  The move comes months after the departure of chairman and co-founder Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused by more than 70 women of sexual misconduct, including rape. The board had been in talks to sell the Weinstein Company to an investor group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet and backed by billionaire investor Ronald Burkle for $500 million. That deal was derailed in early February, when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing the Weinstein Company of “repeatedly” turning a blind eye to the sexual harassment allegations against its co-founder. According to Variety, a deal still seemed possible as of Wednesday, when Schneiderman met with Contreras-Sweet and members of the Weinstein Company board in Manhattan. On Sunday, however, the Weinstein Company board broke off the talks. “We must conclude that your plan to buy this company was illusory and would only leave this Company hobbling toward its demise to the detriment of all constituents,” the board said in a letter to Burkle and Contreras-Sweet, according to Variety. “Despite your previous statements, it is simply impossible to avoid the conclusion that you have no intention to sign an agreement ― much less to close one ― and no desire to save valuable assets and jobs.” Harvey Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company in October, amid mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The movie mogul, who is reportedly seeking treatment in Arizona, has denied allegations of non-consensual sex. He acknowledged in a statement last year that his behavior had “caused a lot of pain.” ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
EU Wants Search Engines To Be More Up Front About Ads,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's digital chief wants search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing to be more transparent about advertising in web search results but ruled out a separate law for web platforms. European Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip, who is overseeing a wide-ranging inquiry into how web platforms conduct their business, said on Friday the EU executive would not take a horizontal approach to regulating online services. ""We will take a problem-driven approach,"" Ansip said. ""It's practically impossible to regulate all the platforms with one really good single solution."" That will come as a relief to the web industry, dominated mainly by big U.S. tech firms such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, who lobbied hard against new rules for online platforms and what they saw as an anti-American protectionist backlash. ""We praise the Commission for understanding that a horizontal measure for all platforms is practically impossible,"" said Jakob Kucharczyk, director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association which represents the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon. ""While a lot of online platforms enable economic growth, their business models differ widely."" However Ansip said he was worried about how transparent some search engines are when displaying ads in search results. The Commission is also looking into the transparency of paid-for reviews as well as the conditions of use of services such as Google Maps, Apple Inc's IoS mobile operating system and Google's Android. ""Maybe it's not too much to ask for more transparency talking about search engines,"" Ansip said. The former Estonian prime minister also poured cold water on the idea that the Commission would make search engines pay to display snippets of news articles, dubbed the ""Google tax"", as part of its EU copyright law reform due later this year. The EU executive is looking into making rules on taking down illegal content clearer and more effective without making hosting websites such as YouTube directly liable. ""Now musicians ask, please, take it down and keep it down,"" Ansip said. ""We want to make those rules more clear."" But the Commission will not change a provision where websites such as Amazon, eBay and Google's YouTube are not held liable for illegal content that is uploaded on to their systems. They do, however, have a responsibility to take it down once they are notified of it. The Commission will publish a communication detailing its plans on web platforms in June.

Pika's Moss-Eating Habit May Help Creature Adapt To Climate Change Rather Than Succumb To It,"From Mother Nature Network's Laura Moss: A new study reveals that climate change might not threaten pikas as much as scientists once thought.

Past research has shown that rising temperatures drive the animals to higher elevations or wipe them out completely, but University of Utah biologists discovered that roly-poly pikas in one area have found a unique way to adapt.

The pikas living in rockslides near sea level in Oregon survive hot temperatures by eating more moss than any other mammal.
""To our knowledge, this study represents the highest degree of voluntary moss consumption reported for a mammalian herbivore in the wild,"" states the paper, which appears in the February 2014 issue of Journal of Mammalogy. Pikas are very sensitive to heat, and the tiny critters can die if they spend more than two hours above 78 degrees Fahrenheit.

""They basically are shaped like spheres, which is optimal for conserving heat,"" said biology doctoral student Jo Varner in a news release. ""They have a thick fur coat and a high metabolic rate, which means they generate a lot of heat. The thick fur coat traps it, and so does their spherical shape.""

Researchers observed 220 hours of pika behavior and were surprised to find that the animals were eating so much moss.

""By consuming mosses that grow on the rockslides where they live, the pikas are released from foraging outside the safety and shady heat buffer of the rocks,"" said Varner. By staying so close to home, the creatures are less likely to overheat or to fall victim to predators. ""Few herbivores consume moss because it's so nutritionally deficient. The pikas in our study actually set a new record for moss in a mammal's diet: 60 percent.""

""Some fiber is good, but this is almost all fiber,"" said Denise Dearing, senior author of the study. ""Mosses are 80 percent fiber. It's a bit like eating paper.""

Researchers also found that pikas in this population build smaller food caches to survive the winter than pikas that live at higher elevations. Living at a lower elevation with warmer temperatures gives the animals access to what the biologists describe as a ""year-round salad bar.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
'Bipartisan Beer' And The Telling Tale Of Anheuser-Busch’s Super Bowl Ad,"The brouhaha over Anheuser-Busch’s spectacular  Super Bowl ad is just another example of how toxic the political environment has become in the wake of President Trump’s recent and apparently illegal travel ban on immigrants from certain (read “seven, majority Muslim”) nations.  It would be funny if it weren’t so scary-sad that a American brand found it important to say something silly like, “beer is bipartisan.”  As everyone already knows, Anheuser-Busch is one of the nation’s great brewing companies, indeed the largest in the world.  It is over 140 years old. It was cofounded by a young German immigrant Adolphus Busch, who endured and overcame challenges as he pursued  his goal: to build a brewing business. They’ve been a corporate sponsor of the Super Bowl for eons.  Telling the brewer’s corporate “heritage story,” this year’s blockbuster Super Bowl ad, produced by the ad agency Anomaly, sets forth a historical romantic tale of a young immigrant who came to America with a dream. Titled “Born the Hard Way,” the ad  plays  like a dreamy movie trailer set in the 1800s. You ‘re almost ready to reach for the popcorn.  But wait! The Washington Post reports that a boycott-the-beer movement has been floated on social media, fueled by Trump supporters who see a sinister plot and subliminal politics in this handsomely produced and as-American-as-apple-pie heritage story ad.  America is Built on the Energy of Immigrants —from Everywhere Thank goodness for immigrant energy and ambition. Without it America wouldn’t be America. For instance, we wouldn’t have Google (founded by a Russian immigrant); Panda Express (founded by Vietnamese immigrants); Kraft Food (founded by a Canadian); ZUMBA fitness (founded by a Colombian immigrant); Capital One (founded by a British immigrant); EBay (founded by a French immigrant); Intel (founded by a Hungarian immigrant); Kohl’s (founded by a Polish immigrant); Yahoo (founded by a Taiwanese immigrant), AT&T (founded by a Scottish immigrant); and Chobani (founded by a Turkish immigrant). These and more are celebrated by a US Chamber of Commerce site titled Free Enterprise,  in an infographic about immigrant entrepreneurs. Other American companies founded by immigrants include Ford, McDonald’s, Home Depot, Disney, Hertz, Estee Lauder, and many more household brand names. Some 45% of the nation’s technology companies and half of the medical technology companies on the Fortune 500 list were launched by immigrants or the children of immigrants. A story in the Atlantic reports that two out of every five Fortune 500 companies were founded immigrants or second-generation immigrants, defined as the children of immigrants. And who’s really surprised? Since its founding, this country has been built by racially, ethnically, religiously, and linguistically diverse immigrants, from all over the world. American Immigrant Heritage Stories So what’s the story behind this ad? Introducing consumers to the personal, human saga behind what today seems like a huge corporate producer is one way to compete in a beer market where small batch craft breweries have made a dent. Telling a company’s heroic “heritage story” has become a popular marketing tool, designed to influence and impress both internal and external audiences, investors, and customers. It’s a truism of marketing that authenticity counts. What could be more passionate and authentic than a story that begins, “once upon a time, a young immigrant had a dream…”. Powerful back stories have been adapted for corporate marketing for decades now; It’s true of Proctor and Gamble, and of the mega-brewer, too. Still, the kerfuffle caused by the coincidental timing of Anheuser-Busch’s ad release (coming one week after a federal travel ban was announced via Presidential executive order, and then rescinded by the courts) was sufficient to cause the company to release a defensive statement that they were about selling their beer and their brand, and were not making a comment on religiously discriminatory bullying or politics. “Budweiser’s Super Bowl commercial highlights the ambition of our founder and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream. This is a story about our heritage and the uncompromising commitment that goes into brewing our beer. It’s an idea we’ve been developing along with our creative agency for nearly a year. We believe beer is bipartisan and this commercial is not political commentary.” And, the public can expect more such heritage stories, impressing consumers with images of American can-do and perseverance (though it’s unclear if these stories will continue to be linked to the hot button issue of immigration). In a press release the company said, “Throughout 2017, Budweiser will celebrate those who live life on their own terms and never back down.” Given the politicization even of Super Bowl ads, that last bit is a phrase worth remembering, in the current climate: never back down.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Report: Michael Cohen's Business Partner Cooperating With Prosecutors,"A business partner of U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in investigations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Evgeny Freidman, a Russian immigrant who is known as the Taxi King, will avoid jail time and will assist government prosecutors in state or federal investigations, the newspaper report said, citing a person briefed on the matter. The New York State Attorney General’s Office said in a press release that Freidman had pleaded guilty to a criminal charge on Tuesday in an Albany, New York, courtroom, but it made no mention of whether he was cooperating with prosecutors. Freidman has been Cohen’s partner in the taxi business for years, even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage taxi medallions, the New York Times said. Freidman, when asked by Reuters about the report, declined in a text message to answer any questions about cooperating with prosecutors or the terms of his agreement. “This is me taking responsibility for my actions! ... Michael is a dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That’s it! ...I hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of!” Freidman said by text. Freidman’s lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to comment on the Times report. Freidman had been accused of failing to pay more than $5 million in taxes and five other criminal counts each carrying maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years. In pleading guilty to a single count of criminal tax fraud, Freidman will be sentenced to five years’ probation, the attorney general’s office said. A spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations and perhaps other matters related to Trump’s presidential campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said. The investigation into Cohen arose in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, something that Trump has repeatedly denied.",POLITICS,POLITICS
17-Year-Old Snowboarder Wins United States’ First Gold Medal In Pyeongchang,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - American Redmond Gerard claimed the United States’ first gold medal of the Pyeongchang Winter Games on Sunday with his victory in the snowboarding slopestyle competition. Gerard scored a run of 87.16 to hold off Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris, who finished second and third respectively. The 17-year-old Gerard, the youngest in the competition, landed a perfect backside triple cork 1440 on his final run and despite Parrot landing the same trick on the final run of the day the judges favoured the American. Gerard believes taking a risk in the final run was the difference between himself and Parrot. “I haven’t had time for it to sink in yet,” Gerard told reporters minutes after the final result. “I just look for different lines. I thought about (taking an easier line) but then I realised my trick over (the second jump), going straight over, isn’t as good so I probably would have got fourth or fifth. So I might as well try and do good.” In a later news conference, Gerard said he was already looking forward and would be taking a break from competition after the Olympics to make snowboarding films. Every boarder had three cracks at the course, with each athlete’s result calculated as the best score of the three as assessed by the nine judges. Despite frigid temperatures of -13 Celsius, the sun shone down on the fans gathered at the foot of the slope to cheer on the riders. However, it was a strong cross-wind of 2 m/s, combined with nerves, that caused problems for the athletes on their first run. Over half the competitors suffered a fall on the first run, including a heavy fall for Parrot, before New Zealand’s Carlos Garcia Knight kick-started the competition with a switch backside 1260 on the final kicker to lead after the first heat. He would never improve on that to finish fifth. With rivals Sebastien Toutant, Gerard and Parrot still struggling to land a clean run, McMorris took control of the contest with a spectacular second run, finishing with a backside triple cork 1620 to score 85.20 and take the lead. Gerard raised the bar with his backside triple cork 1440 during his final run to take the lead off McMorris and the Canadian couldn’t respond, falling on the final kicker. Parrot landed the same trick on his third run but could only score 86.00 to finish second. Afterwards, Parrot admitted to feeling the pressure going into the final run of the morning. “I felt a lot of pressure, especially after bailing my first two runs and not putting a score down. I had to land this run so the pressure was at its maximum level but I think I dealt pretty well with it,” Parrot told reporters. “I knew my run would be on the podium so with that being said I was happy and when the score came out and I was second it was something very special.” It was a disappointing day for Norway, who had three riders in the competition. Sochi Games silver medallist Staale Sandbech was fourth, with teenage sensation Marcus Kleveland a disappointing sixth. (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)",SPORTS,SPORTS

How The Refugee Caravan Became A Scapegoat For Trump’s Border Crackdown,"President Donald Trump spent his first year in office calling for a border crackdown. But there was a problem with his narrative of an urgent crisis: Illegal crossings had dwindled to their lowest number in more than four decades, and many of those coming were families and children.  This spring, he seized on the opportunity to illustrate the border “crisis” he’d been warning of all along: A caravan of Central American asylum-seekers headed for the southern border, at the same time as border agents reported an uptick in border apprehensions. The caravan has traveled to the border each year for a decade, and apprehension numbers, while higher than last year, were well in line with standard trends. But that didn’t seem to matter. Fox News covered the caravan constantly. The president tweeted about it. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice made statements targeted at the caravan. The message was that the caravan was a symbol that the border wasn’t secure, thanks in part to “loopholes” for asylum-seekers that the administration wants to eliminate. Citing the caravan and the apprehension numbers, the administration has justified a major policy change and demanded legal reforms that could make it harder for people in danger in their home countries to legally seek asylum in the U.S. On Monday, the administration publicly announced a long-in-the-works policy to prosecute illegal border crossing that is already separating parents from their children and putting asylum-seekers in jail. This comes soon after the president called for the National Guard to be sent to the border, and the DOJ announced it was sending more prosecutors and immigration judges to handle border cases. “This image and the scapegoat that’s being used to galvanize anti-immigrant supporters is something that doesn’t even exist,” said Alex Mensing, an organizer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, the group that coordinated the caravan. “There’s no horde of invading people using fraud to game the asylum system. That’s not there, and it’s definitely not what the caravan is.” The immigrant rights group Pueblo Sin Fronteras started organizing caravans in 2008 to help people in Central America who wanted to flee danger and to call attention to the plight of migrants. It offers migrants safety in numbers — the journey from Central America to Mexico and then the U.S. can be dangerous. Once at the border it can be helpful to have other witnesses around should U.S. officers break protocol and turn away someone they shouldn’t. Organizers advise caravan participants to go to ports of entry to seek asylum, which is perfectly legal, and many have done so.  The Trump administration hasn’t framed it that way. In an April 23, statement DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the department was monitoring the caravan and that its participants had ”the apparent intention of entering the United States illegally.” A week later, Trump tweeted that the caravan was “openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.” On April 30, the DOJ announced the first prosecution associated with the caravan. They alleged 11 people were caravan members, although their arrest reports don’t explain how they arrived at that conclusion. Several of the 11 defendants are challenging their arrests on the basis of discrimination, noting that the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy didn’t lead to the prosecution of Indian nationals traveling in the same group, only to Central Americans.  Overall, the Trump administration has mashed together two issues: illegal entry into the U.S. and asylum-seekers who arrive at points of entry because they fear returning to their home countries. Top officials know that the latter is legal — Nielsen repeatedly said it was the proper channel during a Senate hearing on Tuesday.  But the administration wants to deter people from using it anyway. Nielsen has said in public statements that asylum-seekers should stay in Mexico rather than coming to the U.S. for safety. She and Attorney General Jeff Sessions implied repeatedly that many asylum claims are fraudulent. The claim is that these protections — based on U.S. and international law — are loopholes that are preventing the U.S. from keeping out Central Americans, whom Trump sarcastically referred to last week as “some real beauties.” “There seems to be a working assumption that anyone who expresses a fear of returning to their home country is somehow gaming the system,” Royce Bernstein Murray, policy director at American Immigration Council, said.  Meanwhile, the administration has decried the “crisis” of border crossings, which are tracked by counting apprehensions both at ports of entry and along other places on the border. Numbers increased in March 2018, but then remained about the same in April. They’re considerably higher than the same months in 2017, but those were particularly low ― this year’s crossing numbers are roughly in line with prior years, including a trend of increases in the spring. Last year, illegal crossings were at their lowest point since 1971, with asylum-seeking children and families making up a large number of the arrests.  “They are trying to justify the policies that they’ve already come to the conclusion are good for the country. And so they’re using any statistics that they can put together in order to justify greatly expanding enforcement operations, expending more time and resources on this issue,” David Bier, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute.  On Monday, Sessions used both the caravan and border apprehension numbers to justify a new DHS policy that will refer all illegal entry arrests to the DOJ for potential prosecution. This was notable because it has already included people that have historically not been prosecuted, such as asylum-seekers and parents traveling with their kids. Locking up parents for prosecution, rather than holding them in immigrant detention, necessitates splitting them up from their children. The policy was a long time coming — the administration has floated splitting up families for a while. It separated at least 700 children from their parents at the border since October 2017. From July to November, it piloted the same “zero tolerance” policy of prosecutions in one sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. During that period, border apprehensions of families who weren’t at ports of entry increased, although DHS claimed the opposite in an internal memo, Vox reported. Sessions implied the policy change was meant, at least in part, as a deterrent to both border crossings and group efforts like the caravan.  “Today we are here to send a message to the world: We are not going to let this country be overwhelmed,” Sessions said in San Diego on Monday. “People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. ” These prosecutions won’t apply to people who show up at ports of entry, which means it has little to do with the caravan’s participants who did so. At the same time, it will affect other asylum-seekers, some of whom cross the border illegally but then present themselves willingly to Border Patrol. Those aren’t the frightening criminals trying to evade the law that the administration makes them out to be, Murray said.  “Whether it’s an effort to get funding for a border wall, or whether it’s an effort to get tough at the border, or to fear-monger and paint asylum-seekers as part of some dangerous invasion, it all fits into a convenient narrative that immigrants are scary and here to hurt us when they are oftentimes moms and kids looking for help,” Murray said. If families keep coming to the U.S. in spite of the threat of prosecution, more children could wind up going into Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, which has limited capacity to house unaccompanied minors before they are released to sponsors. These prosecutions will also allow the Trump administration to point to a statistic to show how hard they’re cracking down on illegal crossings. Sessions said Monday he wants to double the number of immigration prosecutions this year. Funneling people into magistrate court to convict them of illegal entry typically results in light sentences of a few days, before they are whisked into deportation proceedings ― which could easily rack up successful prosecutions. But immigration prosecutions already take up half the federal criminal docket, sapping the time that federal judges have to hear more serious crimes. All of this almost certainly will be used for more calls urging Congress to change the law to limit the “loopholes” that prevent the administration from keeping migrants out of the country. Many of those so-called loopholes were created to protect both asylum-seekers and children. They include allowing people who express a credible fear of returning to their native countries to make a case for asylum ― not that all of them get it ― rather than being turned away or swiftly deported. They also include releasing families and unaccompanied minors from detention while they undergo their cases, thanks to a decades-old court settlement and law enacted by Congress. During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Nielsen attributed the increase in asylum claims, family unit apprehensions and unaccompanied minors to people “gaming the system” — rather than problems in Central America. The administration’s framing deceives Americans into thinking asylum-seekers who do the right thing are actually breaking the law, said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA. “What the United States administration is doing is criminalizing people, putting people in one basket and saying everybody is criminal,” she said.  “People here in the United States,” she added, “are being told lies.” Roque Planas contributed reporting.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Arizona Passes Education Budget To End Teacher Walkout,"Arizona teachers appeared ready to head back to their classrooms after the governor signed a budget bill Thursday that will pump more money into schools and give teachers the first of what should be two pay raises. The massive teacher walkout, carried out under the banner #RedForEd, began a week ago and closed schools for a majority of Arizona students. Thousands of teachers flooded the Capitol and turned downtown Phoenix into a sea of red each day, urging lawmakers to restore education funding after years of deep cuts since the recession. The legislation signed by Gov. Doug Ducey (R) early Thursday did not meet all the demands initially laid out by the groups coordinating the walkout, and some teachers had hoped to keep schools closed until legislators committed to a larger budget. But it was enough progress for union leaders to recommend teachers return to the classroom and prepare for another battle later in the year. Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, told Phoenix’s 12 News that teachers overall were unhappy with the legislation but viewed it as a start. Many teachers, he acknowledged, were hoping for more money for their classrooms. “I think they’re pretty frustrated. They wanted to see a more robust package,” Thomas said, adding that the bill would not reduce class sizes. “What we do see is a lot of promises by the governor that are not going to come true.” But after a week of school closures, Thomas added, teachers will now “be moving toward the classroom” with an eye on the November elections. The budget bill gives teachers a 9 percent pay raise next year, which, combined with a 1 percent raise already given, gets them halfway to the 20 percent hike they have called for. Ducey has promised that the second installment will come by 2020, though that is not guaranteed by the package he signed.  The plan steers bulk money to districts and gives them the discretion to dole out the raises as they see fit, meaning not all teachers will receive the same percentage pay bump. An analysis done by the Arizona Republic found that a minority of districts under the plan will not receive enough money to give all their teachers 20 percent increases.  The bill also hikes state spending on schools by $200 million per year more than Ducey originally proposed at the start of the year. Still, it comes up well short of the walkout organizers’ demand that funding be restored to 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. The Arizona protest came on the heels of similar walkouts in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma ― all red states that have seen education funding drop and teacher salaries stagnate in recent years. The Arizona walkout was being planned for weeks, after West Virginia teachers successfully negotiated raises by closing schools for nine days. A grassroots group, Arizona Educators United, organized the walkout in conjunction with the union. As in those other states, Arizona lawmakers have carried out significant tax cuts over the years, leading to budget shortfalls and little money to devote to schools. Per-student funding has dropped by 14 percent over the past decade, when adjusted for inflation. The unions leading the wave of teacher strikes around the country have had to make hard decisions about how long to hold out for their demands. Parents have largely been supportive of the walkouts and their aims, but public backing can flag over time as schools remain closed and family’s daily lives are disrupted.  While Arizona teachers did not get all they asked for in the budget bill, the union probably called for teachers to return to work for fear they would lose leverage over time, even if some teachers wanted to continue the walkout. As one teacher put it on the Arizona Education Association Facebook page: “Keep fighting for the children, the future of education in Arizona!! Don’t throw in the towel, this is NOT over yet!!”",POLITICS,POLITICS
The Right Kind Of Daydreaming,"When it comes to daydreaming, there may be two very different ways of letting your mind wander ― and if that’s the case, you want to make sure you’re doing it right. Daydreaming is something we all do every day. Up to 50 percent of your waking life, your mind could be floating somewhere else. This can be disturbing when you realize that researchers have linked a wandering mind to negative consequences like car accidents, poor educational performance and even unhappiness. But other research tells a different story, finding that daydreaming is also associated with creativity, social skills and, interestingly, happiness. This apparent contradiction might actually make sense. Usually, common behaviors and emotions that are often considered negative ― like boredom, for example ― can actually exist for a positive reason. “We daydream so frequently that it’s reasonable to assume that maybe our brains do this in a functional way,” says Paul Seli, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychology at Harvard University. “Maybe it’s actually quite beneficial to mind wander. And there’s a smaller area of research showing this is the case.” In a recent article published in Trends in Cognitive Science, Seli and his colleagues explore this possibility, proposing that there are two types of mind wandering: on one hand, an unintentional breakdown of focus that can be harmful, and on the other, an intentional and deliberate disengagement that can actually be productive. Sometimes you are perfectly capable of sustaining your focus but choose to daydream about, say, your summer vacation. Other times, despite your best efforts to concentrate, random thoughts keep popping up in your head. One type of daydreaming involves an intentional shift in focus (“I’d rather think about this right now”), and the other involves an unwelcome or unintentional interruption (“Why am I thinking about this right now?”). Distinguishing between two different types of mind wandering is not new, Seli said. Leonard Giambra, a scientist who has been studying daydreaming since the early 1970s, noted this distinction. Giambra and his colleagues suggested that sometimes our minds wander because unrelated thoughts capture our attention. Other times, we deliberately shift our attention to them. However, in most studies of daydreaming, researchers have made the assumption that mind wandering is only unintentional, Seli says. He argues that it’s important to make a distinction between intentional and unintentional daydreaming — because if the two behaviors are merged as one construct, it can lead to contradictory findings.   There may be entirely different neural mechanisms underlying the two types of mind wandering. For example, unintentional daydreaming may be a sign of failure in the brain’s attention system, whereas intentional daydreaming occurs with some deliberate control. Giambra’s studies and more recent research have shown how one type of mind wandering may be more common for people with certain disorders. People with ADHD, for example, are just as likely as people without ADHD to daydream intentionally, but are also much more likely to do it unintentionally. The same goes for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, Seli said. It’s possible that most negative consequences of mind wandering are related to the unintentional kind of daydreaming, Seli said, while intentional daydreaming may provide benefits like a boost in creativity. Some researchers noticed the benefits of daydreaming early on. In 1975, Yale psychologist Jerome L. Singer published The Inner World of Daydreaming, a product of his years of research into the phenomenon. Singer acknowledged that daydreaming could be associated with ruminative thoughts and poor attentional control, but he also identified a positive type of daydreaming characterized by playful imagery and creative thought. This is what Singer called “positive constructive daydreaming” and considered to be an essential element of a healthy mind, linked to a number of positive functions. “Singer noted that daydreaming can reinforce and enhance social skills, offer relief from boredom, provide opportunities for rehearsal and constructive planning, and provide an ongoing source of pleasure,” writer Rebecca McMillan and psychologist Scott Kaufman wrote in a 2013 review of Singer’s work. “Singer describes those who engage in positive constructive daydreaming as ‘happy daydreamers’ who enjoy fantasy, vivid imagery, the use of daydreaming for future planning, and possess abundant interpersonal curiosity.” Researchers have also found that while unintentional daydreaming is associated with fidgeting and acting mindlessly, deliberate daydreaming may be linked with certain aspects of mindfulness.  In a 2014 study, Seli and his colleagues at the University of Waterloo in Canada found that deliberate mind wandering was particularly connected to one factor of mindfulness, known as “nonreactivity to inner experience,” which involves perceiving feelings and emotions without having to react to them. “The more people intentionally mind wander in their daily life, the more mindful they are, whereas the opposite is true for unintentional mind wandering,” Seli said.  In unintentional mind wandering, you simply can’t concentrate. But in intentional mind wandering, you may be not motivated to pay attention, and instead choose to think about something else. However, even this can be too costly in certain situations — for example, in a classroom where you need to pay attention and learn the material. Seli’s research has found that in a college classroom setting, intentional daydreaming occurs more often than unintentional daydreaming. This, Seli says, suggests that it may be more fruitful to increase students’ motivation rather than try to boost their focus. Meanwhile, mindfulness training could help people reduce their unintentional daydreaming. Even though daydreaming may lower your performance in the present or make you miss your subway stop, however, it could also help in the long run. As Singer had observed and more recent research continues to suggest, daydreaming allows us to plan for and rehearse future events. When the task at hand is easy enough to perform without full attention, people take the opportunity to shift their thoughts to planning future events or solving problems. So if you are in a place where you can afford to daydream, go ahead. If you need 100 percent of your brain power to work on something, try taking breaks every now and then to let your mind wander free.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"Night Parrot, Nocturnal Bird In Australia, Seen Alive For First Time In Over A Century","By Thuy Ong SYDNEY, July 5 (Reuters) - A nocturnal Australian parrot  that hops like a kangaroo and had not been seen alive for more  than a century has not only been seen but has been photographed,  a naturalist said on Friday, but he is keeping the whereabouts a  secret. Scientists had previously based their knowledge of the  critically endangered Night Parrot, a ground-dwelling bird, on  the occasional dead specimen and recordings of its call - which  is rare enough. ""I've only heard them in one place and I've been in a  hundred places,"" said John Young, a naturalist and documentary  film maker who has consulted with Australian wildlife services. ""The strangest thing about this parrot, living on the  ground, it hops like a little kangaroo."" Young's alleged sighting on May 25 in the northern state of  Queensland was the culmination of a 15-year quest. He told  Reuters that he lured the shy, palm-sized bird out with a  recorded parrot call. ""I couldn't get over it,"" he said. The Night Parrot is small with yellowish green plumage,  mottled with brown and black specks. It hides in spinefex grass  during the day and is active at night. In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN) listed the bird as critically endangered, its population  depleted by feral cats, foxes and changes in the environment  after European settlement in Australia. With no firm estimates about how many of the birds exist in  the wild, Young refused to reveal where he found the parrot. ""I think the worst thing we can do at the moment is to let  too many people anywhere near it,"" said Young. ""In the time I  had with the bird the other night, it is the most sensitive bird  I have ever seen."" Leo Joseph, the director and research leader of the wildlife  collection at government research body CSIRO, supported Young. ""The sooner we can learn how to look for them and find them  elsewhere the better,"" Joseph told Reuters. ""For now, keeping  the locality a secret is the way to go.""

The One Thing Your Company Can Learn From Google’s Diversity Debacle,"Why your diversity and unconscious bias training is failing: Google made headlines over the weekend when a 10-page manifesto released by a white male engineer about his beliefs on meritocracy and the shortcomings of Google’s diversity and unconscious bias training efforts went viral. His essay suggests that the company encourage ideological rather than gender diversity and argues that Silicon Valley is a meritocracy where brilliance alone should be enough to get ahead. This comes on the heels of a report highlighting the lack of diversity at Google. About 69 percent of its total workforce is male. The one thing he got right: The unnamed blogger is correct on one point ― that most diversity and unconscious bias training doesn’t work. The reason being is most make no effort to discuss why diversity is critical for white men. In fact, many diversity practitioners say that inclusion is the key, yet as an older white male, I rarely see myself talked about in diversity initiatives. In fact, you can look at Google’s free online Unconscious Bias training program, you see no reference to white men being mentioned. In a very simple manner, I have to ask myself ‘what’s in it for me?’ If a majority of your workforce is white men company programming and solutions need to integrate and involve them in diversity and inclusion initiatives. The three things he got wrong: 1) Meritocracies:The belief that meritocracies work. The manifesto writer talks about the fact that meritocracies work. The problem is meritocracies are defined by the majority group, and thereby do not value diverse work-styles, whether they are made by other men, minorities or women. Additionally, we have all seen leaders who value results at the expense of long-term vision and strategy. While meritocracies may work for short-term projects, they are not long-term business strategies for success. 2) Diversity and Inclusion: In fact, many men actually support diversity and inclusion. For diversity and unconscious bias training to be effective we must be able to talk about our differences and we must be able to talk about what is in this for the majority group, (typically white men in the organization). In my work to find and create male champions to advocate for advancing women, I have found it’s a combination of 75% business case and 25% personal connection. This personal connection piece is the most critical element to move people from merely understanding diversity to understanding and becoming an advocate. 3) Unconscious Bias: Unconscious bias training must take a deep dive into cultural differences. An online course or even a program facilitated by the instructor without proper knowledge and expertise will not work. The reason unconscious bias training doesn’t work is that it doesn’t go deep enough. Companies today must offer unconscious bias sessions with deep dives into gender, race, age, and specifically white male culture. The one final key point: Social media is transforming what is going on in the workplace. Consider the Google engineer’s anti –diversity manifesto going viral, the blog written by a former Uber employee about sexual harassment and gender bias that brought down the CEO or allegations against FOX cable commentators prompting advertisers to pull away from shows. Senior leadership must be proactive, today, in being vigilantly visible and vocal supporters of diversity and inclusion. It is simply a matter of time before your company could be on the front page of USA Today. Jeffery Tobias Halter is a corporate gender strategist, the country’s leading expert on engaging men to advance women. Jeffery is the President of YWomen, a strategic consulting company and the author of two books, including WHY WOMEN: The Leadership Imperative to Advancing Women and Engaging Men.",BUSINESS,TECH
Employment Falls In September After Hurricanes Harvey And Irma Undercut Economic Activity,"WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. employment fell in September for the first time in seven years as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma left displaced workers temporarily unemployed and delayed hiring, the latest indication that the storms undercut economic activity in the third quarter. The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls decreased by 33,000 jobs last month amid a record drop in employment in the leisure and hospitality sector. The drop in payrolls was the first since September 2010. The Department said Harvey and Irma, which wreaked havoc in Texas and Florida in late August and early September, had reduced “the estimate of total nonfarm payroll employment for September.” Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 90,000 jobs last month. The government revised data for August to show 169,000 jobs created that month instead of the previously reported 156,000. Payrolls are calculated from a survey of employers, which treats any worker who was not paid for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month as unemployed. Many of the displaced people will probably return to work. That, together with rebuilding and clean-up is expected to boost job growth in the coming months. Leisure and hospitality payrolls dived 111,000, the most since records started in 1939, after being unchanged in August. There were also declines in retail and manufacturing employment last month. Harvey and Irma did not have an impact on the unemployment rate, which fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 4.2 percent, the lowest since February 2001. The smaller survey of households from which the jobless rate is derived treats a person as employed regardless of whether they missed work during the reference week and were unpaid as result. It showed 1.5 million people stayed at home in September because of the bad weather, the most since January 1996. About 2.9 million people worked part-time as a result of the bad weather. The length of the average workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours. With the hurricane-driven temporary unemployment concentrated in low paying industries like retail and leisure and hospitality, average hourly earnings increased 12 cents or 0.5 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August. That pushed the annual increase in wages to 2.9 percent, the largest gain since December 2016, from 2.7 percent in August. Annual wage growth of at least 3.0 percent is need to raise inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target, analysts say The mixed employment report should not change views the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last month that the hurricanes could “substantially” weigh on September job growth, but expected the effects would “unwind relatively quickly.” The U.S. central bank said last month it expected “labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.” The Fed left interest rates unchanged in September, but signaled it expected one more hike by the end of the year. It has increased borrowing costs twice this year. The employment report added to August consumer spending, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales data in suggesting that the hurricanes will dent economic growth in the third quarter. Economists estimate that the back-to-back storms, including Hurricane Maria which destroyed infrastructure in Puerto Rico last month, could shave at least six-tenths of a percentage point from third-quarter gross domestic product. Growth estimates for the July-September period are as low as a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter. Construction payrolls rose 8,000 in September. Manufacturing employment slipped by 1,000 jobs. Retail employment decline by 2,900 jobs.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
10 Behaviors That Highlight Your Leadership Ability,"  Based on my years of experience as a new business advisor, I always find leadership to be more important to business success than any new technology or innovative solution. The challenge is to adequately define leadership in terms of everyday activities. Most entrepreneurs believe they are leaders, even though the feedback I get from their team and partners may indicate otherwise. Thus I’m always looking for more practical guidance on the right activities to be perceived as a business leader. I just found some great specifics in a new book, “The Leadership Challenge,” by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner. These authors bring a wealth of experience in this domain from their workshops, writing, and lecturing on business leadership worldwide. They have identified ten specific behaviors of exemplary business leaders that I believe every entrepreneur and business professional must focus on to improve their leadership abilities, as well as the perception of others around them as a leader: Exemplary leadership behaviors like these will always make a profound positive difference in people’s commitment and motivation, their work performance, and the success of their company. Especially if you are don’t yet carry an executive role or title, now is the time to start practicing these activities. The most effective and satisfying leadership comes without a title to lean on.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Facebook Built Censorship Tool To Appease China Expansion,"Facebook has quietly developed a censorship tool that could persuade China to allow the world’s biggest social media network to re-enter the world’s second largest economy after a seven-year ban, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. Facebook developed the software, which suppresses posts from appearing in people’s news feeds in specific geographies, with the support of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the newspaper said, citing unnamed current and former employees. Zuckerberg in March met China’s propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan who said that he hoped Facebook could strengthen exchanges and improve mutual understanding with China’s internet companies, according to state news agency Xinhua. “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country,” Facebook spokeswoman Arielle Aryah said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “However, we have not made any decision on our approach to China. Our focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” Foreign companies in China, especially in media, face political pressure from a range of regulations. The country’s military newspaper calls the internet the most important front in an ideological battle against “Western anti-China forces.” China, which has the world’s largest population of internet users, banned the website following the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about ethnic unrest which left 140 people dead. Though Facebook has developed the new tool, it does not intend to suppress the posts itself, NYT said. Facebook would instead offer the software to enable a third party to monitor popular stories and topics that gain visibility as users share them across the network, according to the Times. The third party partner would have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users’ feeds. There is no indication Facebook has offered the software to the authorities in China, the Times said. It is one of many ideas Facebook has discussed with respect to entering China and it may never see the light of day, it added. Facebook, which has struggled in recent months to combat allegations that it unfairly removes certain content on its service, aims to continue to grow in developing nations where it currently has smaller penetration rates.

Giant Artwork Reflects The Gorgeous Complexity of The Human Brain,"Your brain has approximately 86 billion neurons joined together through some 100 trillion connections, giving rise to a complex biological machine capable of pulling off amazing feats. Yet it's difficult to truly grasp the sophistication of this interconnected web of cells. Now, a new work of art based on actual scientific data provides a glimpse into this complexity. The 8-by-12-foot gold panel, depicting a sagittal slice of the human brain, blends hand drawing and multiple human brain datasets from several universities. The work was created by Greg Dunn, a neuroscientist-turned-artist, and Brian Edwards, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, and goes on display Saturday at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. There will be a public unveiling and a lecture by the artists at 3 p.m. ""The human brain is insanely complicated,"" Dunn said. ""Rather than being told that your brain has 80 billion neurons, you can see with your own eyes what the activity of 500,000 of them looks like, and that has a much greater capacity to make an emotional impact than does a factoid in a book someplace.""   To reflect the neural activity within the brain, Dunn and Edwards have developed a technique called micro-etching: They paint the neurons by making microscopic ridges on a reflective sheet in such a way that they catch and reflect light from certain angles. When the light source moves in relation to the gold panel, the image appears to be animated, as if waves of activity are sweeping through it. First, the visual cortex at the back of the brain lights up, then light propagates to the rest of the brain, gleaming and dimming in various regions -- just as neurons would signal inside a real brain when you look at a piece of art. That's the idea behind the name of Dunn and Edwards' piece: ""Self Reflected."" It's basically an animated painting of your brain perceiving itself in an animated painting.  Here's a video (made by Will Drinker) to give you an idea of how the etched neurons light up as the light source moves:  To make the artwork resemble a real brain as closely as possible, the artists used actual MRI scans and human brain maps, but the datasets were not detailed enough. ""There were a lot of holes to fill in,"" Dunn said. Several students working with the duo explored scientific literature to figure out what types of neurons are in a given brain region, what they look like and what they are connected to. Then the artists drew each neuron. Dunn and Edwards then used data from DTI scans -- a special type of imaging that maps bundles of white matter connecting different regions of the brain. This completed the picture, and the results were scanned into a computer. Using photolithography, the artists etched the image onto a panel covered with gold leaf. Then, they switched on the lights: ""A lot of times in science and engineering, we take a complex object and distill it down to its bare essential components, and study that component really well"" Edwards said. But when it comes to the brain, understanding one neuron is very different from understanding how billions of neurons work together and give rise to consciousness. ""Of course, we can't explain consciousness through an art piece, but we can give a sense of the fact that it is more complicated than just a few neurons,"" he added. The artists hope their work will inspire people, even professional neuroscientists, ""to take a moment and remember that our brains are absolutely insanely beautiful and they are buzzing with activity every instant of our lives,"" Dunn said. ""Everybody takes it for granted, but we have, at the very core of our being, the most complex machine in the entire universe.""",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
How To Make Rush Hour Less Deadly And Terrible,"Rush hour in a city is no picnic, but it could get much better if moving cars communicated with each other.  Much of the technology that could perfect traffic flow and safety already exists -- automatic braking, driverless features and the like -- and cities are now trying to integrate it all into systems that could anticipate the various movements of walkers, bikers and drivers. Three federally funded pilot projects in New York City, Tampa, Florida, and the state of Wyoming are currently testing smart vehicle technology. In addition to coordinating traffic signals and vehicle movement, the programs are also exploring ways that the technology could divert cars from unexpected traffic jams. Engineering giant Siemens announced this week that it would develop technology for Tampa's connected vehicle program. The company is already working with a number of cities around the country, including New York City, to improve transportation.  “If there’s an accident, if a traffic light breaks down, if a stadium releases people after a game, that’s a different traffic pattern,” Kevin Riddett, president of the mobility division at Siemens, told The Huffington Post of the Tampa program. “The system should be able to automatically route different directions to people.”  In ideal traffic systems, cars approaching an intersection would automatically slow down as the light turns red. They would sense one another and be able to travel faster and closer together, using fuel more efficiently. They'd also be alert to potential pedestrian collisions. The technology could send alerts to drivers if a handicapped pedestrian is navigating a busy crosswalk, or if a driver is approaching a curve in the road at too high a speed.  The three pilot projects received $42 million from the Department of Transportation to test the software. The program in Tampa will be implemented over 18 months and will be studied for three years. Of course, an interconnected network isn’t limited to roads. In dense cities like New York, where people rely heavily on public transportation, officials are also finding ways to increase connectivity within subway systems and between trains and commuters. That includes adding communications-based train control, a technology developed by Siemens that allows New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority to better monitor where subways are and add more trains to the routes. It’s already been installed on the L train and is expanding to the Queens Boulevard line, which is used by the E, F, M and R trains. As subway riders know all too well, connectivity extends to the customer experience too -- and it’s an area where agencies have sometimes been slow to catch up to the public’s demands.  At a transportation panel held Tuesday at Bloomberg LP’s headquarters in New York and sponsored by Siemens, transportation officials pointed to small things, like countdown clocks alerting riders to the arrival of the next train. These have had a big impact on people’s commutes, they said. “What I thought were luxuries -- connectivity, improved, enhanced experience -- are things that people believe” in having now, Thomas Prendergast, chairman and CEO of the MTA, said at the panel. “And they’re becoming a larger percentage of our ridership base. We have to respond to them.” Here's a local TV interview from last year with the Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority, which is leading the Florida prong of the connected vehicle project:",TECH,TECH
Uber Unveils 'Movement' Tool To Help City Planners Better Analyze Traffic Patterns,"Ride-hailing giant Uber says it will offer city planners and other researchers a rare peek behind the curtain and open up access to its trove of traffic data. The new service, called Uber Movement, is essentially a dashboard through which users can interact with anonymized trip data in aggregate, allowing researchers to study both broad traffic patterns and more granular neighborhood data on an hourly basis throughout the day. Uber’s motive here isn’t purely altruistic. In addition to helping government officials better understand their cities, the company undoubtedly hopes the information will lead to smarter infrastructure investment decisions, thereby benefiting Uber as well. “We don’t manage streets. We don’t plan infrastructure,” Andrew Salzberg, Uber’s chief of transportation policy, told Wired. “So why have this stuff bottled up when it can provide immense value to the cities we’re working in?” Uber initially opened the service to Manila, Philippines; Sydney; and Washington, D.C., as a trial, and says it will add more cities in the coming weeks. Eventually, the company says Movement will be “freely available to the public.” While Movement’s potential benefits are great, traffic planners may want to temper their expectations. A similar program implemented by Uber in Boston in 2015 has so far failed to deliver, with The Boston Globe concluding it has “not lived up to [the] hype so far.” “While the data has been very useful in understanding the growth of [transportation network companies] and their service profile in the city,” Boston CIO Jascha Franklin-Hodge told The Boston Globe, “we’ve not had a lot of big success in putting the data to use in a more planning-oriented context.” It’s interesting timing for the announcement. Last week, Uber sparred publicly with the New York City Taxi & Limo Commission, which wants access to the company’s rider destination data, something it currently requires of taxis in the city. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Uber Offering $5 Rides In New York City,"Uber is about to get a lot cheaper in New York City -- that is, if you don't mind sharing your ride with a stranger and walking a few extra blocks to catch a car. The new offer, which is supposed to make routes more efficient, comes during a time of hot debate over the economic and environmental impacts of ride-hailing services.  Uber announced Monday that it will start charging some New Yorkers a $5 flat rate for using the app's UberPool option. ﻿While UberPool has been around since 2014, letting multiple riders in an area share a car and split the tab, the update aims to streamline the feature even more.  The deeply discounted fare will apply only to UberPool trips below 110th St. in Manhattan during peak hours (7-10 a.m. and 5-8 p.m.) on weekdays. To take advantage of discounted UberPool trips, riders will have to walk several blocks to what is effectively an Uber bus stop to catch their ride. They'll also likely have to schlep another few blocks to their destination once they've been dropped off.  “Corner pickups and drop-offs make driving routes more direct, so you'll save time and arrive at your destination faster,” Uber said in a blog post, per The Verge.  While the original UberPool often sees drivers taking long, circuitous routes to pick up their riders, having more direct routes could mean less fuel burned per trip. $5 UberPool trips are part of a pilot program the company is testing. Uber hasn't said when the pilot will end.  So how many people will actually hump it several blocks out of their way for a cheaper fare? Take our poll (below) and let us know whether you'd be willing to give up convenience for a lower UberPool rate: Uber and rival tech companies and ride-hailing apps are making personal car ownership less and less necessary -- in cities, anyway. Car-sharing options, like UberPool, could be key to solving the twin problems of clogged roads and automobile pollution plaguing major urban areas, according to a 2015 report from the consulting firm McKinsey and Company.  Uber says UberPool already cuts down on carbon emissions, compared to the app's UberX option, which functions more like a traditional taxi service. If other companies that offer ride-sharing services can encourage riders to walk a short distance to catch their car, they could help reduce emissions even more.  But not everyone thinks advancements in the auto world, like self-driving cars and more efficient ride-sharing services, will reduce pollution. Self-driving cars, for instance, make it easier to travel by car. And if drivers have to do less work behind the wheel, they might drive longer or more often, upping the amount of energy they consume and pollution they generate. In addition, efficient carpooling services could discourage people from using public transit.  ""Even car-sharing services could increase energy demand if the ease and convenience pulls people away from mass transit, walking or biking and into cars,"" Jason Bordoff, former energy adviser to President Barack Obama, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in April.  Questions also remain about how carpooling services affect drivers. Some Uber drivers have complained that they don't like UberPool because it requires them to shuttle multiple passengers without receiving any extra pay. Drivers have also said that UberPool hurts their ratings.  Shorter routes could result in drivers making less money per trip, although it could also allow drivers to pick up more trips during a shift. Note: The Huffington Post's Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is a member of Uber's board of directors, and has recused herself from any involvement in the site's coverage of the company.",TECH,TECH

Former U.S. Olympic Coach Under Criminal Investigation Amid Larry Nassar Scandal,"The Eaton County, Michigan, sheriff’s office announced on Tuesday that John Geddert, the former U.S. women’s gymnastics Olympic coach who worked closely with former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar, is facing a criminal investigation.  The Lansing State Journal reported on Tuesday that the sheriff’s office said “there are new people coming forward” with complaints against the former U.S. Olympic coach. The department said it could not comment about the details of the complaints as the investigation was ongoing.  Neither Geddert nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Geddert was the head coach for the women’s gymnastics team during the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics. He owned two training centers where Nassar worked and was reportedly very close with the disgraced physician, who has been accused by over 265 women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar repeatedly molested many young girls at Geddert’s training center Twistars.  USA Gymnastics suspended Geddert in January amid Nassar’s highly publicized sentencing hearings. A few hours later, Geddert announced his retirement.  Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Additionally, he is serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. During Nassar’s sentencing hearings, dozens of survivors accused Geddert of being physically and verbally abusive, with some saying he must have known about Nassar’s abuse.  “My mother once told me ‘If a boyfriend ever treats you the way John does, leave him,’” survivor Annie Labrie said during her victim impact statement.  At least one athlete said in her victim impact statement that Geddert walked into the room while Nassar was molesting her. Geddert and Nassar first began working together at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club. Later, in 1996, Geddert brought Nassar on to work at the gym he currently owns, Twistars USA Gymnastics Club.  Geddert was competitive and was borderline abusive, verbally and physically, to gymnasts, according to Outside the Lines.  “John’s very good at emotional manipulation. He can make you feel like nothing very quickly,” former office manager at Twistars, Priscilla Kintigh, told Outside the Lines. “Larry was the one to calm the girls down when they had a practice with John.”   Geddert is one of dozens of adults who surrounded Nassar for over two decades while the team doctor molested young athletes. Several officials at USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned in late January. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned and the NCAA opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case.  In January, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Lobbying Spending Hits Historic Lows,"by Geoff West Washington lobbying groups spent less money and reported fewer lobbyists during the third quarter of 2017 than in any quarter since at least 2008, when Center for Responsive Politics began tracking the totals. Congress spent the summer considering Obamacare repeal, a tax overhaul and immigration reform, yet controversy failed to inspire an expected uptick in Washington lobbying. From July 1 to September 30, companies and organizations spent about $754 million on lobbying, a quarterly low. There were also 9,200 registered lobbyists, or about 800 fewer than the previous three-month period. Third-quarter lobbying is typically the slowest quarter in Washington as legislators leave for August recess, but the decline in both spending and registered lobbyists was dramatic even for the slow months. Despite the third-quarter dip, however, 2017 spending is on pace to pass 2016 totals due to an influx of spending during the first six months of the year. Overall, the lobbying world has spent about $2.43 billion this year compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016. More than 8,500 companies, municipalities, trade associations and other organizations have reported federal lobbying this year – from less than $5,000 by the city of Murfreesboro, Tennessee to $58 million by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the perennial top spender. So far this year, the top 20 lobbying groups have spent about $310 million of the $2.43 billion total. The Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Realtors, Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and the American Medical Association were the top spenders in the third-quarter as well as 2017 overall so far. While overall spending declined, a few companies dipped deeper in their pocketbooks during the third quarter. New Shipper Bond Petitioners Coalition, for example, spent $550,000 last quarter after $340,000 in the first half of 2017 for lobbying activity related to “enforcement of antidumping duty orders and collection of duties secured by ‘new shipper’ customs bonds.” Less spending on lobbying means less work to go around for professional lobbyists. However, despite the sluggish third-quarter, the top lobbying firms continued to get plenty of work. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld was the top lobbying firm in the third quarter with $9.2 million in billings, bringing its total to $28.5 million reported in 2017 so far.   Other notable firms include Roberti Global, which reported taking in $1.6 million in the third quarter after reporting about $2 million in the first six months. That was the largest quarterly increase by any firm. Among industries, pharmaceuticals and health products spent $62.2 million, the most by any industry.  The insurance ($38.1 million) and electronics manufacturing and equipment ($35.5 million) industries were the second and third highest spenders. Turning from industries to broader economic sectors, third-quarter spending in 2017 compared to 2016 varied widely. The communications and electronics sector increased its spending more than $6 million over last year’s third quarter, while the financial, insurance and real estate sector cut spending by more than $10 million.",BUSINESS,POLITICS
"EPA Unlikely To Pursue Fracking Contamination Cases Anytime Soon, Analysts Say","By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Federal regulators are  unlikely to step up enforcement of potential water contamination  cases linked to natural gas drilling - despite new concerns  about water safety - given a lack of political will and limited  resources to pursue such cases, analysts said. A report quietly made public on Christmas Eve by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's internal watchdog brought back  into the spotlight concerns about the effects on water quality  from the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or  fracking. The report said the EPA was justified in issuing an  emergency order in 2011, asking the oil and gas driller Range  Resources to improve monitoring and provide clean water  to a family in Parker County, Texas, whose water supply had been  contaminated with methane as a result of nearby fracking. The EPA Inspector General also criticized the agency for  backing off enforcement of the complaint in 2012. At the time, the EPA said that as a compromise for dropping  its lawsuit it would work with Range to examine the effects of  fracking on drinking water in a future national study on  fracking and groundwater. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency will continue to share  any additional sampling data and relevant information provided  by Range and other parties with the state regulator, the Texas  Railroad Commission. A spokesman for Range said the company has  not heard back from the EPA regarding the study. Some see the inspector general's report as justification for  the EPA to more aggressively enforce pollution cases related to  fracking, but other analysts and former officials say the agency  lacks both the desire and capacity to do so. Fracking is regulated on a state-by-state basis. The only  national EPA rule so far, on air emissions from operations,  known as ""green completions,"" will take effect in 2015. The Texas contamination case was the third instance in which  the EPA backed off of an initial assertive stance and instead  deferred to local regulators. ""As a result of three relatively unflattering outcomes, EPA  may aim before it shoots in the future, but politics has been a  factor, too,"" said Kevin Book, an energy analyst at Clearview  Energy Partners. Ahead of congressional elections in November,  Book said ""similar activism from EPA is fairly unlikely.""                 GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS Amy Mall, a senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources  Defense Council, an environmental group, said she doubts the  agency will reverse what she called the trend of ""systematically  pulling back from high-profile investigations"" because fracking  is the ""third rail"" of U.S. energy policy. Specifically, she said, President Barack Obama may be  hesitant to send any signal that federal regulators will step in  to slow the expansion of natural gas production. The natural gas boom has been a bright spot for the Obama  administration. Lower gas prices have helped create a domestic  manufacturing renaissance and lower household energy bills while  cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The administration is also aware of industry groups sounding  the alarm over prospects for a national study of fracking and  groundwater due to be finished in 2015 to open the door to new  federal rules on fracking. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue warned   last month that the study could be used to justify clamping down  on the drilling techniques that have sparked a surge in U.S. oil  and natural gas output. Steve Everly, a spokesman for pro-fracking group Energy in  Depth, said energy firms worry about EPA overreach. ""There may be a culture of 'shoot first, ask questions  later' that even the Office of the Inspector General sadly  thinks is permissible,"" Everly said. ""I always thought EPA's  mission was to protect the environment, not attack productive  industries."" At the same time, fracking draws strong opposition from  environmental groups that constitute part of the political base  for Obama as well as Democrats in general. ""I do hope the agency sees the particular inspector general  report as providing them some additional validation and support  to take future actions when necessary,"" said Al Armendariz of  the Sierra Club, a former regional EPA official. Armendariz was head of the EPA's Dallas regional office when  the original order was made against Range Resources. He resigned  in 2012 after Sen. James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma,  released a video of him saying the agency should ""crucify"" oil  and gas firms that violated environmental laws. While Armendariz called for a more assertive EPA, he told  Reuters that technical challenges dog the agency's enforcement  efforts. Cases related to energy extraction are more of a  challenge than those related to clean air regulation because  there are more ""technical hurdles and challenges in the  subsurface,"" he said. The EPA has had a much lower rate of enforcement at energy  extraction sites than it does at power plants or industrial  facilities that have polluted the air, for example. In 2012, the EPA inspected 870 energy extraction sites and  concluded enforcement actions against just 53. The agency  investigated 836 coal-fired electric units for potential air  pollution incidents and controlled 461 of them. One former EPA official said investigating energy extraction  sites requires a lot of money and thousands of staff - both in  short supply given tight budgets. ""To do a case where it involves taking significant  environmental samples in the field - it is very expensive,"" the  official said.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT

Los Angeles Agrees To Host 2028 Summer Olympics,"Los Angeles has agreed to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced Monday afternoon. Los Angeles, which last hosted the Olympics in 1984, had originally sought to hold the 2024 Games. When several cities backed out of potential Olympic bids, however, the IOC decided to break precedent and award the 2024 and 2028 Olympics at the same time. Los Angeles’ agreement to host the 2028 Summer Games means Paris, the only other city to bid, will host the competition in 2024. The news was originally broken by the Los Angeles Times, which cited a source close to the city’s negotiations with the IOC. “This is an historic day for Los Angeles, for the United States and for the Olympic and Paralympic Movements around the world,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in a statement released by LA 2024, the private organizers behind the city’s Olympic bid. “Today, we take a major step toward bringing the Games back to our city for the first time in a generation and begin a new chapter in Los Angeles’ timeless Olympic story.” The United States last hosted the Summer Olympics in 1996, in Atlanta, and the Winter Olympics in 2002, in Salt Lake City. Los Angeles’ efforts to host the Olympics for a third time ― it also held the games in 1932 ― were nearly derailed at numerous points in the process. The U.S. Olympic Committee initially tapped Boston as its choice to bid for the 2024 Games, until that bid collapsed amid fervent local opposition in July 2015. Los Angeles stepped in to replace Boston a month later. But it was seen as a long shot to beat out Paris, which last hosted the Olympics in 1924 and had narrowly lost out to London for the right to host the 2012 Games. Handing the 2024 and 2028 games to Paris and Los Angeles could bring some needed stability ― and good public relations ― to an Olympic movement that has been in peril in recent years. The exorbitant costs and empty, destructive legacies of the Olympics have turned off potential hosts, and in each of the last two bidding cycles, the IOC has found itself with only two cities willing to handle the games. Three cities canceled Olympic bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, while four others backed out of 2024 contention thanks to opposition from local citizens and political leaders. Los Angeles, however, is almost a model Olympic city. It turned a small profit in 1984, and even Olympic skeptics have said that the city’s bid is financially sound and unlikely to lead to the kind of massive cost overruns that so many other hosts have experienced. Garcetti and LA 2024 have highlighted the city’s 1984 experience, pushing their bid as a chance to show that the Olympics can be held in a responsible manner. In a press conference Monday evening, Garcetti stressed that the city aims to make the games economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers’ money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children throughout the city.  Still, the process this time around will likely create its own challenges. No city has ever before had to wait more than a decade between agreeing to host the games and actually staging them. That creates a long window during which political, social and economic forces could change dramatically, exacerbating the numerous problems that always arise in staging the event.  California’s state legislature and the Los Angeles City Council must still approve the plans to host the 2028 Games. The city council will consider the matter in August, according to the LA 2024 release. It is expected that both bodies will approve the agreement, given that both had already given their blessing to the 2024 effort. That will pave the way for the IOC’s members to formally award the 2024 and 2028 Olympics to Paris and Los Angeles, respectively, at a September meeting in Peru. Organizers behind NOlympics LA, a grassroots group that launched this year, said they would continue fighting to keep the games out of Los Angeles while lawmakers consider the 2028 agreement.  “We’re not surprised but we’re really disappointed,” said Jonny Coleman, who helped start the group. “By no means is this officially on. There’s so many things that have to happen before the games are actually awarded here. In the next month or so, we’re going to be really loud and really aggressive.” The story has been updated with the announcements from the International Olympic Committee, LA 2024 and the mayor’s press conference. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Starbucks Under Fire For Giving Less Parental Leave To Hourly Workers,"Why does Starbucks think it’s OK to give its well-compensated salaried employees far better paid leave benefits than hourly workers who are already barely scraping by? On Monday, some of the company’s shareholders filed a resolution demanding an explanation. At issue is a new Starbucks maternity and paternity leave policy that went into effect over the weekend. The coffee giant now gives salaried workers ― some of whom make six-figure salaries ― 18 paid weeks off for maternity leave. Hourly workers, who earn around $10 an hour, get six weeks paid time off if they physically give birth to a baby. Hourly workers who adopt also get six weeks off fully paid. Men who work hourly and whose partners give birth get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate also get 12 weeks, but fully paid. Adoptive parents and men who work hourly get 12 weeks off without pay; men and adoptive parents who work in corporate get the same amount of time, but fully paid. The company has around 180,000 U.S. employees and the vast majority work in the stores, meaning the generous leave policy effectively goes to only a privileged minority. “This is a discrimination claim just waiting to happen,” said Pat Miguel Tomaino, associate director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management in Boston, the lead filer on the shareholder resolution, with four other social impact investors including Reynders McVeigh Capital Management, Arjuna Capital, Pax World Management and Friends Fiduciary Corporation.  Not only is Starbucks’ reputation as a progressive company at risk, Tomaino said: “It’s a moral issue.” In an email, Starbucks spokesperson Jaime Riley emphasized the company offers extremely generous benefits to hourly employees who work 20 hours or more a week including health care, a stock plan, free college tuition and 401(k) matching. The company’s parental leave benefits are “exceptional” in the retail industry, Riley said.  Indeed, only 14 percent of private sector employers have access to paid parental leave. When HuffPost asked how Starbucks squared the inequality between hourly worker and corporate parental benefits, Riley said, “That’s an interesting phrasing of that question.” She added that the company takes “a competitive approach and provide[s] benefits based on what our partners express as their needs and preferences.” Jess Svabinek, a 38-year-old barista at a Starbucks about 40 miles away from Seattle who makes $11.05 an hour, is out on unpaid leave now with her baby boy and certainly would have preferred more paid time off.  “I can’t even grasp having to go back to work after just six weeks,” she told HuffPost. “I’m nine weeks out from a C-section and I couldn’t imagine getting up at 2 in the morning for the morning shift and leaving the baby. That’s when we’re up nursing.” Svabinek, who had her baby before the new policy went into effect, was able to take 8 weeks off at 67 percent of her regular pay. She is relying on her husband, who makes $20 an hour at Trader Joe’s, to get by on leave for as long as possible.  She figures she’ll be back to work in January, if she can swing it financially. Already, her husband has put off some much-needed dental work to make everything possible. Starbucks is hardly the only retailer to offer better benefits to higher paid workers. Walmart gives women in its corporate office 12 weeks of paid maternity leave while its hourly workers get none, according to data compiled by Paid Leave U.S., a nonprofit advocacy group that also worked on Monday’s Starbucks proposal. Yum Brands, Taco Bell’s parent company, only gives paid leave to corporate full-timers; not to workers in its fast food restaurants. Other companies, including Ikea and Bank of America, provide equal benefits to all workers.  This kind of class-based discrimination is baked into how companies do business, paying different workers different salaries based on their desirability. No one would argue that there’s anything wrong with those salary differences.  But the issue of paid leave is trickier. It’s hard to seriously claim that a baby deserves less time with his mom because she couldn’t get a fancy white-collar job. And the issue isn’t really one the private sector is ever going to solve on its own. The problem is the United States has left what is essentially a public policy issue in the hands of private companies that are accustomed to doling out unequal benefits to workers.  The Starbucks shareholder proposal emphasizes that these corporate paid leave policies are significant because the United States is one of only a handful of countries in the world without any paid maternity leave policy, placing companies like Starbucks at the center of a critical national policy issue. Yet the shareholders aren’t looking to start some crazy revolution. The resolution asks that Starbucks’ board look into the paid leave disparity and produce a report evaluating the discrimination risks that might arise. Tomaino wouldn’t say how he’d like Starbucks’ policy to change. “It’s not our role to be prescriptive,” he said, adding that he’d just like the company to re-evaluate the policy with an eye toward fairness, employee morale and the risks of lawsuits. The investor groups say Starbucks’ leave policy is particularly disturbing because over the years the company has developed a reputation for treating its workers well and providing equal benefits to all employees.   Starbucks was also an early supporter of gay marriage, yet LGBTQ hourly workers are particularly hurt by the lack of paid leave for adoptive parents. Those workers are far more likely than their straight counterparts to adopt or foster children. Activist investors have increasingly been pushing companies on social issues, most recently urging companies to report on gender and pay, with some success ― convincing a handful of major tech companies to make public information on their pay gaps. “Investors now are stepping forward,” said Tomaino, who hopes to replicate those successes when it comes to paid leave.  The Starbucks resolution is the first of its kind, but expect more. Tomaino said his organization is also talking to 11 other major retailers, including Target, Amazon, Costco and Apple about their paid leave policies ― or lack thereof. The group is looking at the issue of unequal benefits, as well as cases in which the amount of leave offered is simply inadequate.  Without paid leave, many women are forced out of the job market. Others are set back in their career paths, by taking less-demanding jobs, declining promotions or dropping back to part-time work with the arrival of a child. That means many parents wind up tapping public benefits like food stamps to get by when a baby arrives on the scene.  The lack of paid leave is one major reason women in 2017 still make just 80 percent of what men earn on average, according to federal data, and that the U.S. lags other developed countries when it comes to the percentage of women in the labor force.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Starbucks did not offer paid leave to hourly workers who adopt children. In fact, the company provides them with six paid weeks off.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
These Untrained Orangutans Can Row Boats And Even Help Humans With Chores (VIDEO),"These orangutans are located in the Camp Leakey research facility in Central Borneo, where they are observed by researchers who aim to return them to the wild.  Though the orangutans are untrained, they are watching us and learning, just as much as we are watching them and learning. So much so, that when they are ""simply free to do what orangutans do,"" the apes might just get in a boat and start rowing.   Yes, they row boats.  Their amazing adaptive abilities don't stop there, and through observation they have learned to help humans with chores like doing the laundry. Although it might be imitation, it is still an incredible demonstration of teamwork. The DNA structure of orangutans and humans differ by a remarkably small amount, so their willingness to learn and be challenged is not so surprising. Borean Orangutans are classified as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Habitat loss due to forest destruction is the primary cause of a significant population decline in recent decades.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Researchers Find Second U.S. Patient Infected With 'Superbug' Gene,"Scientists have identified a second patient in the United States infected with bacteria carrying the mcr-1 ""superbug"" gene, which makes bacteria highly resistant to a last-resort class of antibiotics. The gene, found in a sample of E. coli bacteria from a patient in New York, follows the discovery late last month of a patient in Pennsylvania who had a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli that carried the gene. The finding was published on Monday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The mcr-1 gene makes bacteria resistant to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat multi-drug-resistant infections, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, which U.S. health officials have dubbed a ""nightmare"" bacteria. What is concerning about the mcr-1 gene discoveries in the United States is that bacteria have the capability to share resistance genes. U.S. officials are worried that the mcr-1 gene may find its way into CRE bacteria, potentially creating bacteria resistant to virtually all types of antibiotics. Scientists have been tracking the mcr-1 gene's movement around the globe since it was discovered last year in people and pigs in China. The latest U.S. finding of mcr-1 came as part of a global effort called the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, led by Mariana Castanheira of JMI Laboratories based in North Liberty, Iowa. Researchers tested 13,525 Escherichia coli and 7,481 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from patients collected last year from hospitals in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe and North America. Of these, 390, or 1.9 percent, were resistant to colistin, and 19 of these isolates tested positive for the mcr-1 gene. Samples carrying the gene came from 10 countries and included some from each region. Only one came from the United States. It involved a New York patient infected with E. coli whose name and condition were not disclosed. In both U.S. cases, bacteria that carried the ""superbug"" gene were resistant to colistin but susceptible to a number of other antibiotics, making the infections treatable. To keep track of the spread of this resistance gene in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has disclosed plans to expand laboratory capacity to seven or eight regional laboratories, plus add capacity to laboratories in each U.S. state as well as seven cities or territories. In the United States, antibiotic resistance causes at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths annually.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Get Used To Nor'easters — Arctic Warming May Mean More Severe Winters In The Northeast,"As average temperatures rise across the planet, the frozen Arctic is heating up faster than anywhere else. With that warmth comes a surprising twist: Unusually warm Arctic winter temperatures are linked to bitter cold and snow in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the northeastern U.S., parts of northern Europe and northern Asia, according to an analysis of 66 years’ worth of climate data.   And the relationship between Arctic warmth and severe winter weather was strongest in in the northeastern U.S. — in fact, a temperature spike in the Arctic meant that the U.S. Northeast was two to four times more likely than usual to experience a bout of extreme winter weather, the scientists reported in a new study. [The 10 Worst Blizzards in US History] Past climate projections predicted that, in a warming world, winters would be the seasons to heat up the fastest — and yet recent winters in the Northern Hemisphere were more severe than scientists anticipated, said Judah Cohen, the study’s lead author and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an organization that assesses risks from weather events and climate change. To understand what might be driving these unusual episodes, Cohen and his colleagues looked at pulses of warmth in the Arctic during winter months, to see how they lined up against weather anomalies elsewhere in the globe. “When the Arctic pulse is warm, you tend to get an increase in occurrences of extreme winter weather across the midlatitudes, including the eastern U.S., northern Europe and northern Asia,” Cohen told Live Science. The relationship between spiking Arctic warmth and pockets of cold to the south was “really, really strong” — and it was strongest in the eastern U.S., Cohen said. Since 1990, the eastern U.S. has been visited by winter storms so severe that they earned highly dramatic nicknames, such as “Snowzilla,” “Snowmaggeddon” and “Snowpocalypse.” The increase in incidences of extreme storms with heavy snowfall corresponded with periods of excessive Arctic warmth, the study authors wrote. How does this relationship work? As the scientists’ observations reflected only the comparison of weather patterns over time — and not what was driving them— the researchers could not conclude that a warmer Arctic was directly responsible for harsh winter storms in the U.S., they reported in the study. But answers may lie in another atmospheric disturbance linked to a warming Arctic, Cohen said. According to the study, data from past decades showed that fall snow cover in Siberia increased as the Arctic warmed, which cooled northeastern Eurasia. Meanwhile, melting sea ice fueled warmer temperatures in northwestern Eurasia. These air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affected the jet stream — a conveyer belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe — by increasing its “waviness,” making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. In turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex, Cohen explained. And this disturbance of the polar vortex could end up shaping conditions that worsen winter weather in the U.S. “The cold air that’s normally confined to the Arctic, it’s kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself — because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south,” Cohen said. “When it breaks down, the cold air that’s penned up in the Arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that’s when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.” Arctic scientists like to say that “what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” but the interconnectivity between Earth’s dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, Cohen said. The complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported.   “I’d argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic,” Cohen said. “It was kind of expected that if you warm the Arctic, the only thing that’s going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere — and that’s not a complete picture.” The findings were published online today (March 13) in the journal Nature Communications.

Protecting What We're Afraid Of,"  The government of Raja Ampat created the first shark sanctuary in Indonesia setting aside all of the regency's 4 million hectares of coastal waters for sharks © The Nature Conservancy Fear and fascination have long characterized people's relationship with sharks, the oceans' great predator. You can't say the word shark to an American without invoking images from the classic movie Jaws. In one famous scene Quint, the shark hunter, sums up our primal fear:  ""And, you know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be living... until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and... they all come in and they... rip you to pieces."" (Jaws) People are transfixed with these predators. Some twenty million people will tune in to watch SharkWeek this week. Vicious shark attacks grab headlines around the world. While tragic, the truth is shark attacks are still quite rare. Sharks have much more to fear from humans than we do of sharks. Each year up to 73 million sharks are threatened by shark finning, a barbaric practice where people catch sharks, slice their fins off and then toss them back in the ocean where they drown. The fins catch a high price, prized for shark fin soup, an Asian delicacy.  What's incredible is that despite this fear we're beginning to respect these great predators and recognize how important they are to keeping oceans healthy. People are taking positive steps around the world to save sharks. From California to the European Union, governments are working to end the trade of shark finning. Perhaps even more significantly Indonesia, one of the largest exporters of shark products in the world, established the country's first shark sanctuary in Raja Ampat earlier this year. While this is only one sanctuary, it represents a huge shift that will hopefully inspire other parts of the country to value live, healthy sharks more highly than their fins. Not to mention shark diving can bring in millions in ecotourism income each year. Willing tourists can't resist a chance to swim with these iconic predators.  Shark conservation and habitat protection are also gaining momentum. In Palmyra, a remote island in the Pacific, south of Hawaii, there's a living lab that helps scientists understand top predators' role in our oceans. In the Caribbean, commitments to expand shark conservation were announced at the recent Caribbean Summit of government and business leaders. Additionally, in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, The Nature Conservancy and partners are growing and restoring corals, which are important habitat for sharks. By protecting the top predators we keep the whole ecosystem healthy.  ""In the end, our society will be defined not only by what we create, but by what we refuse to destroy,"" said John C. Sawhill, former president and CEO of The Nature Conservancy. It's a pretty amazing fact that we can now include sharks in this statement. Sharks have cut gracefully through ocean waters for 400 million years. Hopefully our society will continue helping sharks thrive in years to come.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
National Elephant Center In Central Florida To House Dozens Of Retired Animals (VIDEO),"The elephants of North America now have a place to retire -- sunny Florida. The National Elephant Center, a 225-acre home for retired or unwanted elephants, welcomed it's first four residents in May. The center is located in Fellsmere, Fla., which provides an ideal climate and environment for the African and Asian elephants that will eventually roam there, including watering holes and areas to wallow in mud. (Take a look at a plan of the center here) The $15 million complex is supported by a network of zoos and wildlife organizations and will eventually house dozens of elephants long-term. The center will not be open to the public. Asian elephants are currently listed as endangered and African elephants are considered vulnerable.

Silicon Valley Is Combating Human Trafficking,"Human traffickers worldwide use technology to recruit, exploit, and monitor their victims. They lure victims in Internet chats and forums, post online recruitment and classified advertisements, and use sophisticated anonymity software to cloak their identities. Victims are men, women, children, transgender, and non-conforming individuals who are trafficked for sex and forced labor. They are foreign nationals and United States citizens/residents. There are numerous human trafficking definitions, but the Palermo Protocol is the worldwide standard. The protocol—also known as the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children—supplements the 2000 United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and has been ratified by 167 nations, including the United States. It contains three elements: the act of trafficking, the means of trafficking, and the purpose of trafficking. The act of trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons. The means of trafficking is the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or vulnerability, or giving payments or benefits to a person in control of the victim. The purpose of trafficking is exploitation. This includes, at a minimum, sexual exploitation, including the exploitation of the prostitution of others, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, or the removal of organs. Exact numbers are challenging, but a quick glance at the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which has the largest victim assistance caseload, assisted nearly 7,000 human trafficking victims in 115 nations during 2015. The vast majority of victims—74 percent—were trafficked for forced labor or services and more than half—55.3 percent—were male. As Internet use becomes increasingly commonplace worldwide, so too does its use for recruitment. In Poland, the anti-trafficking non-governmental organization (NGO) La Strada found that even nearly a decade ago 90 percent of Poles who found jobs abroad did so through the Internet. The NGO estimated that 30 percent of trafficking victims it served were recruited this way.[1] Technology isn’t just used in monitoring and recruitment but also to sell the sexual services of trafficking victims. This is primarily done through online classified websites. The site most used for doing so—at least since Craigslist closed its adult services section in 2010—is the classified ad website, Backpage.com. Yiota G. Souras, senior vice president and general counsel at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, testified before the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that more than 71 percent of suspected child trafficking reports submitted by the public to the CyberTipline involve Backpage.com. (This does not include reports Backpage.com makes to the CyberTipline.) In March, the U.S. Senate unanimously voted to hold Backpage.com in civil contempt of Congress. The site, says the Senate, did not comply with a subpoena that required Backpage.com to provide, among other evidence, documents on its procedures for moderating and reviewing advertisements, metadata, and document retention. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported it found evidence that the site sometimes edits classified ad content before publication, such as deleting words and images. This likely served, said the committee, “to remove evidence of the illegality of the underlying transaction”. In October, authorities raided Backpage.com’s Dallas headquarters and arrested its CEO, Carl Ferrer, under pimping a minor and conspiracy charges. In order to combat the use of classified advertisements, online recruitment/job postings, forums, and chats that facilitate modern slavery, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, has developed a sophisticated search engine called DIG (Domain-specific Insight Graphs) Memex. Unlike Google or Bing, DIG Memex plunges into Deep Web depths; web areas not indexed by conventional search engines. It can search all online sex ads (there are more than 60 million), instantaneously extracting and linking hidden information on online illicit activity, and disclose trafficking network names and numbers. In order to accomplish this, DIG Memex searches various networks, including Tor, software that gives users web anonymity through onion routing and was created by the Naval Research Laboratory. Interestingly, DARPA actually contributes financially to Tor and several Tor Project developers are working on DIG Memex. The search engine also digs through Freenet, which allows users to anonymously share files, chat on forums, and use in darknet mode; and I2P, which creates an anonymous network within a network. Manhattan is one of the first cities to deploy DIG Memex, which already has a database packed with tens of millions web pages and grows by 5,000 pages per hour. The curated counter trafficking domain index includes sex trafficking and forced labor, but initially focused on the former. In fact, this seems to be an issue across the board when it comes to combating human trafficking. It appears the technology world hasn’t yet figured out how to best hone in on labor indicators. The small business IST Research, which works on Memex, is trying to figure it out. Using its Pulse information sharing and analysis platform, IST Research is monitoring the supply chain, collating passive Internet data on the Deep Web to find unscrupulous recruitment networks, and determining the best communication method to reach victims and produce active engagement. The concept of using technology to combat criminal activity has existed, well, as long as the proliferation of technology. The telephone, two-way radio, and automobile, changed the law enforcement landscape in the twentieth century. Today, the Internet, text messaging, voicemail, social media networking, and email are continuing to change the law enforcement and advocacy topography. The challenge, of course, is that with ample funds and ready access to new technologies, traffickers are often steps ahead. In 2012, President Obama implored all techies to join the fight against human trafficking. …We’re turning the tables on the traffickers. Just as they are now using technology and the Internet to exploit their victims, we’re going to harness technology to stop them. We’re encouraging tech companies and advocates and law enforcement—and we’re also challenging college students—to develop tools that our young people can use to stay safe online and on their smart phones. Many private technology companies are already on board—applying their expertise and funds to disrupt and combat human trafficking. For example, in 2011, Google gave $11.5 million in grants to support anti-trafficking technology initiatives, including those driven by NGOs and non-profit organizations such as International Justice Mission, Slavery Footprint, and Polaris Project. The latter organization has partnered with Silicon Valley companies Palantir, Salesforce, Twilio, and Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children—founded by Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, in order to disrupt traffickers and identify victims. Polaris launched the NHTRC crisis and tip reporting hotline in 2007 with specialists that can answer calls in more than 200 languages. The 24 hours a day, 7 days a week hotline received, and receives, roughly 100 calls a day from a variety of callers such as victims and survivors, concerned friends and family members, worried neighbors, and organizations wanting to know how best to serve their human trafficking survivor population. Since its inception, the multimodal hotline has received 107,982 phone calls, 6,550 web form contacts, and 7,667 emails that resulted in the identification of 25,791 human trafficking cases. Partnerships between Silicon Valley and Polaris have resulted in a multitude of strides in the anti-trafficking effort. Thanks to these relationships, NHTRC hosts BeFree, a textline, where victims can simply text BeFree (233733) in order to reach a specialist. This is critical because it may be less risky for a victim (depending on his/her particular trafficking situation) to send a text message than make a phone call. The result has been a significant uptick in victims contacting the NHTRC. BeFree launched on March 28, 2013 and, so far, has had roughly 3,617 text conversations that led to 424 human trafficking cases. A larger percentage of victims reach out to NHTRC through text than by phone call, 23 percent compared to 11 percent, respectively. The NHTRC also has an easy-to-use dashboard at their fingertips that lets them quickly locate the most proximate resources for victims, access 150 data variables, and triage information to law enforcement. All data is collected through the sophisticated Silicon Valley Salesforce software system Freedom Force, which syncs nightly with Palantir data analysis software that examines aggregated data and uncovers human trafficking trends. The analysis platform maps trafficking cases, trafficking networks, and can even identify a travel route traffickers are using. Not only does this allow NHTRC to immediately connect victims to resources, it also gives Polaris critical insights to pass along to law enforcement and policymakers, helping to address the issue on multiple levels. Tech-driven anti-trafficking groups are constantly amending their approach to include the newest influx of popular technology. Historically, traffickers have been dozens of steps ahead, if not more. The partnerships between Silicon Valley and NGOs, have, thankfully, begun narrowing the gap. This is an excerpt from the article Technology and Human Trafficking.

Ohio Democrats Fret Over Dennis Kucinich’s Fringe Ties,"Democrats in Ohio are increasingly worried that former Rep. Dennis Kucinich’s ties to fringe groups ― including supporters of Syrian President Bashar Assad and those who promote conspiracy theories around the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks ― will destroy their chances of winning the governor’s mansion in November. “Democrats interested in winning are shitting themselves,” one Democratic elected official told HuffPost on condition of anonymity. “It’s not just baggage. It’s funky baggage. What Democrat is friendly with Assad? What Democrat praised [President Donald Trump’s] inauguration?” “If [Kucinich] wins the primary, he brings down everybody but Sherrod,” said Sandy Theis, former executive director of nonprofit Progress Ohio and a former statehouse bureau chief for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. “He’s so outside of the mainstream.” (“Sherrod” is a reference to the state’s senior senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown.) Kucinich’s backers wave off these concerns as the fretting of out-of-touch establishment Democrats. “It’s easy for the political insiders to say that,” said Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution, the Bernie Sanders-aligned group that has endorsed Kucinich, and a former Ohio state senator. “The heart the congressman has, his history of service to Ohio, that’s what matters, not these made-up boogeymen.” And they see an echo of the 2016 presidential primary, when many of them backed Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, over eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “It seems to us the same argument that Hillary supporters used against Bernie. What it really means is we don’t want to go face-to-face with you on issues and positions, so we’ll argue you can’t win,” said Steve Holecko, the political director of the Cuyahoga County Progressive Caucus. The gubernatorial primary battle between Kucinich and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief Richard Cordray has been the premier Democratic fight of the 2018 electoral cycle so far, pitting a two-time presidential candidate who has the backing of Sanders’ political organization, if not Sanders himself, against a former Ohio attorney general with the backing of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Kucinich’s longtime support for a range of progressive priorities, including Medicare-for-all, marijuana decriminalization and free college tuition, along with his attacks on Cordray’s past support of gun rights, has created a close primary contest. The winner will take on the victor in the GOP primary battle between state Attorney General Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor. Most Democrats who spoke to HuffPost remain hopeful that Cordray will prevail in the May 8 primary. Cordray has spent $1.5 million on television ads meant to raise his name identification. But the high number of undecided voters in public polls means that Democrats can’t feel completely confident about the front-runner. Plus, that spending gap may soon close. Kucinich is expected to launch his first television ads on Thursday, according to two sources tracking media buys in the race, and a group founded by a backer of Lt. Gov. Taylor is spending on TV ads attacking Cordray from the left.  “Why do Republicans love Rich Cordray so much?” a narrator says at the start of the 30-second ad from the Citizens Policy Institute, as Cordray’s face morphs into Trump’s. The ad goes on to attack Cordray for once having an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association and for resigning from his post as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, allowing Trump to name his replacement. “We can’t win with Republican lite,” the ad concludes. “Is Rich Cordray really a Democrat?” (Kucinich has also hammered Cordray over his past NRA support.)  The founder of the Citizens Policy Institute is Tony George, a Syrian-American Cleveland-area restaurateur and a prominent local Trump supporter. His organization is spending about $62,000 on two ads in the Cleveland television market, according to the media-buying sources ― the spot attacking Cordray and another criticizing a local GOP legislator. George, who has a long history of controversy and feuds with local elected officials, has also donated more than a quarter-million dollars to a PAC supporting Taylor in the GOP primary. George, who couldn’t be reached for comment, told BuzzFeed News that the anti-Cordray ad had “nothing to do” with trying to boost Kucinich’s chances of winning the Democratic primary. While much national coverage of Kucinich has focused on his support for progressive ideals long before they were popular within the Democratic Party, his ties to Assad, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul (R) and other controversial figures are what worry state Democrats more than his domestic policy positions. Kucinich received $20,000 to speak at a London conference of the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees, an event that critics derided as propaganda for the Assad regime. The CEO of that association is also a board member of the nonprofit Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth. (Kucinich is returning the $20,000 fee.) The candidate has also questioned special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign, saying it had a “high BS quotient.” He serves on an advisory board of the Ron Paul Institute, alongside Lew Rockwell, who ghost-wrote Paul’s infamous newsletter. He has appeared dozens of times on the RT news channel, which is funded by the Russian government. He called President Barack Obama’s decision to bomb Libya in 2011 an “impeachable offense.” And he’s echoed Trump’s concerns about the so-called deep state and praised his inaugural address. Turner, the Our Revolution president, said Kucinich’s dealings with Assad supporters are part of his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, noting that Kucinich supported the creation of a U.S. Department of Peace when he was running for president. She described his work with Republicans as simply outreach. “Don’t we want someone who’s willing to go into territory that’s unfriendly and try to win people over?” Turner asked. She suggested the local progressive groups that recommended Our Revolution back Kucinich were unconcerned by his views in this area. “Those groups didn’t bring up Russia or Syria,” she said. “It’s curious that one of the ways they’re trying to malign his character is to bring up things no governor of Ohio would have to deal with,” Turner added.  Holecko admitted that Kucinich’s ties to Assad were a “flaw in Dennis’ résumé,” but said the focus on that issue showed establishment Democrats didn’t want to discuss policy positions.  Kucinich’s campaign spokesman, Andy Juniewicz, dismissed the idea that his candidate would struggle to win over voters in the general election as a “phony argument.”  “He ran for mayor of Cleveland against an incumbent Republican and won,” Juniewicz wrote in an email. “He ran for the Ohio State Senate against an incumbent Republican and won. He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against an incumbent Republican and won. Richard Cordray already lost to Mike DeWine the last time they faced off. Whoever is raising the question of electability is obviously unfamiliar with the facts.” Kucinich clearly isn’t concerned with appearing too close to Russia or Syria. On Sunday night, he went on Larry King’s talk show to deplore how unelected elements within the U.S. government were pushing Trump to be “more hawkish, more interventionist” toward Syria. The network? RT.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Sandy Theis is the executive director of nonprofit Progress Ohio.

The NFL Will Never Give Up The National Anthem -- Here’s Why,"The NFL will never give up the national anthem salute. The NFL owners in one form or another will make it official when they meet to hammer out a policy on what players must do when the national anthem is played. Let’s be clear, the NFL’s tie to the national anthem has nothing to do with the oft-cited contention that the Defense Department bribed the NFL to the tune of $5 million between 2011 and 2014 to honor soldiers and vets at its games. This supposedly required players to stand at rapt attention during the playing of the anthem before games. $5 million is not even pocket change to a multi-billion-dollar league. It also has nothing to do with a bunch of ticked off NFL owners hectoring the players to beat back their sideline protests and show them who is boss. And it certainly isn’t because one owner, namely Dallas Cowboy’s owner Jerry Jones, has been screaming loudly that the national anthem must be respected no matter what. The national anthem and the flag are not just the nation’s enduring symbols and paean to American patriotism, they are the standard for America’s military tradition and might. From its very inception and its rising popularity in the latter part of the 19th century, football has been inseparable from both. West Point and the military academies used football as a training vehicle to recruit, train, instill toughness and discipline and most importantly prepare its cadets for warfare. By the turn of the 20th century, football was played on 20 of the nation’s military bases. During World War I, football was virtually enshrined on the military bases to instill military discipline and combat toughness. By World War II, football had virtually become part of the curriculum within the military academies. It got a virtual exemption from the tight constraints put on civilians during the war. Even when some college games were cancelled at the mid-point of the war in 1942, and non-essential civilian travel was barred, the Army-Navy game was still played. Government officials considered the game vital to the nation’s morale. Football crowds were revved up with military bands, flag salutes and displays, and cannon and gun blasts. The ritual included continual reminders of, and tributes, to active servicemen and women and veterans bedecked in full military regalia, decorations and medals. The NFL quickly fell in line and embedded the rituals of military pomp, flag and patriotic displays into all pre-game activities. The players and coaches and even team owners have dutifully answered the call to arms over the years. More than 1,200 have served in combat and other service capacities in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars. For more than a half century, NFL players under the league’s official auspices and in tandem with the USO have trekked to military bases, ships and even combat areas from Vietnam to Iraq on goodwill tours to boost troop morale. That’s not all. The NFL is not just in the business of paying salutes out of history and tradition and patriotic loyalty to the military and the flag. It’s also in the business, literally, of promoting both. It has a lucrative partnership with USA Football, Inc. which licenses and sells millions of NFL apparel and paraphernalia that carry the NFL logo and uniform designs through the NFL FLAG program. NFL FLAG also sponsors and promotes youth training camps, and football related sports programs. The military and patriotic rah-rah came easy for an NFL which is not, and never has been, a democracy. It’s a quasi-militaristic, top-down organization. It’s run by an entrenched elite core of billionaire owners who set the tone and determine policy for the league. They are mostly conservative Republicans, some very outspoken Republicans. They have contributed money, lots of it to Trump and other GOP presidential candidates over the years. Then there’s the NFL’s majority fan base. They have made it clear in informal polls, surveys, and by raining loud boos down on the relative handful of NFL players that have knelt during the national anthem that they will have no regard for any player who “disrespects” the flag. Many go much further than Jones and are not content with benching them, but want them out of the league. They certainly have made that clear about the man who started it all, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. They don’t want him in the league, and the owners have heard them. They listened to them and blackballed Kap because they are the ones who pack stadiums and plop down tens of millions for tickets and assorted NFL paraphernalia. Some players, some sportscasters, some elected officials, and all civil libertarians will shout that compelling NFL players to stand for the national anthem is crass, crude, employer bullying and a blatant disregard of the First Amendment. They’re right. But the brutal reality is that the NFL power brokers have the supreme dominance to enforce their “take it or leave it” dictate on the players, and a big part of that will remain standing bolt upright for the national anthem.

"Amazon Says It Plans To Add 100,000 Jobs","Amazon announced Thursday that it plans to add 100,000 new jobs around the country over the next year and a half. The online retailer said the positions would include all types of jobs, including engineers, software developers and customer service reps, as well as warehouse workers ― in its growing distribution network. The positions would be full-time and come with standard benefits and health care, as opposed to the temp jobs Amazon is known for in the runup to the holidays. Although the company didn’t give an estimated breakdown of those 100,000 jobs, it’s likely most of them would be in the fulfillment centers where workers busily pick, pack and ship orders out to Amazon customers. Glassdoor, a site that tracks salaries based on worker input, pegs the average pay for a fulfillment associate at $12.33 per hour. Amazon used to have its fulfillment centers clustered in certain states for tax advantages, but it’s expanded rapidly to new areas in recent years in order to speed up delivery and dominate the market. The company has opened seven new fulfillment centers in Texas alone since 2013.  But when Amazon adds new positions, it shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a clear net gain for the job market in general. After all, the company and other online-only retailers have helped bury plenty of brick-and-mortar chains and mom-and-pop stores along the way, and they will continue to do so. Many Amazon positions are essentially replacing retail jobs that are having a harder time surviving as buyers bargain hunt online.    Amazon’s annual revenue recently topped $100 billion per year. The company dominated online sales during the holidays, accounting for more than a third of web sales in November and December. CNBC attributed a lot of those sales to Amazon’s offer of one- and two-hour delivery in certain markets, allowing last-minutes shoppers to still buy gifts in time for the holiday.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
New England Patriots Player And Assistant Help Thwart School Shooting Threat,"With the devastating school shooting in Parkland, Florida, fresh on their minds, New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and his assistant Shannen Moen acted quickly and may have helped prevent a potential school shooter.  One of Edelman’s Instagram followers sent him a direct message on March 25, according to the team, alerting the football player to a threatening message in the comments section of one of his posts. “Dude there is a kid in your comment section saying he s [sic] going to shoot up a school, i [sic] think you should alert the authority,” a screenshot of the comment read. Edelman contacted Moen, who found the comment posted beneath a photo Edelman had shared of himself and former teammate Danny Amendola. “I’m going to shoot my school up watch the news,” the comment read, according to The New York Times. Moen contacted authorities, who responded quickly and traced the comment back to a house in Port Huron, Michigan. An article on the Patriots’ website said a 14-year-old boy had confessed to police that he wrote the threat. He was taken to a juvenile detention center and charged with making a false report of a threat of terrorism. Two rifles belonging to the boy’s mother were found in the home. In an interview with the Times, Edelman thanked the fan who alerted him to the threatening message. He also spoke of how the Parkland school shooting has continued to occupy his thoughts. Last month, the Patriots loaned the team’s plane out to fly families of the Parkland victims, as well as students injured in the attack, from Florida to Washington, D.C., so they could attend the March For Our Lives protests. Seventeen students and educators were killed in the Feb. 14 mass shooting.",SPORTS,SPORTS
The Game Boy Of Your Childhood Dreams Finally Exists,"If you were lucky enough to have a Game Boy when you were younger, there was probably one thing you always wanted: more games to play on it. That problem has finally been solved thanks to a crafty gamer who's assembled a custom Game Boy housing a library of titles you can cycle through at will. The ""Game Boy Zero"" device uses a Raspberry Pi Zero computer to read a unique cartridge that holds a memory card containing more games than you probably have time to play. It can run original Game Boy games, Super Nintendo games, Game Boy Advance titles and more. In other words: This is just a Game Boy in looks only. While the classic handheld could only play compatible software in black and white, this device has a sleek color screen and runs titles from a variety of systems. Internally, it's really a computer running a video game emulator -- a program that lets you play pirated old games downloaded from the Internet.  Wermy, the YouTube user who uploaded the video of the device, published a series of images to Imgur showing how the device was constructed: He also answered a series of questions about how he made the device in a thread on Reddit. Notably, he added several additional buttons to the Game Boy -- allowing more advanced games to be played -- and the battery is rechargeable. No more AAs! Sure, you could play all of these games on your computer (if you were inclined to download them illegally), but that's no fun. Our only remaining question is: How do we beam this device to our 4-year-old selves? H/T The Verge",TECH,TECH
Twitter Warns Users To Change All Their Passwords After Finding Bug,"Twitter is urging its more than 330 million users to change their passwords after it discovered a bug in its system that inadvertently stored account passwords in an internal log. The company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, called the glitch an “internal defect.” We recently discovered a bug where account passwords were being written to an internal log before completing a masking/hashing process. We’ve fixed, see no indication of breach or misuse, and believe it’s important for us to be open about this internal defect. https://t.co/BJezo7Gk00 Twitter users on Thursday received an alert from the company explaining the issue and directing them to their account settings so they could change their passwords. In a linked blog post, the company apologized for the problem. “We are very sorry this happened,” said Twitter’s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal. “We recognize and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.” The company fixed the bug, deleted the stored passwords and launched an investigation that showed no signs of a breach or data misuse, according to Agrawal. Still, “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said, it recommended that users change their passwords not only for Twitter but also for any other accounts with the same password. The bug affected a process called hashing, which Twitter uses to mask users’ passwords by cryptographically converting them to different number and letter combinations before storing them. Twitter uses the masked passwords to validate users’ account credentials. “This is an industry standard,” Argawal said. However, the bug discovered by the company caused the passwords to be stored in an internal log before they were masked. Argawal said that Twitter has “no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter’s systems or was misused by anyone” but recommended that users take extra steps to secure their accounts, including two-factor authentication and using different passwords for separate accounts. He received some backlash from Twitter users after he tweeted that the company “didn’t have to” tell users that their passwords had been stored in plain text in its system. We are sharing this information to help people make an informed decision about their account security. We didn’t have to, but believe it’s the right thing to do. https://t.co/yVKOqnlITA If any part of your response to a potential data breach that massive includes the belief that you didn’t have to let your users know, then you are unfit to be a part of the leadership team. lol you know what else you didn't have to do? Store our passwords in plain text. ""we didn't have to tell you we fucked you over"" is a great take here Agrawal later admitted he made a mistake by saying that Twitter didn’t have to inform users of the issue. Dorsey praised Argawal’s response, adding, “I love my teammates.” I should not have said we didn’t have to share. I have felt strongly that we should. My mistake. https://t.co/Cqbs1KiUWd Openly admitting our mistakes quickly, learning, and moving on. I love my teammates. https://t.co/pn9sgUf1Op",TECH,TECH
Facebook Will Show You Less News. Good!,"Of course, the media mostly freaked out on Tuesday after Facebook announced that it would be prioritizing posts from your family and friends over posts from media outlets in your news feed. Facebook warned publishers that they’d take a traffic hit with this latest change. But for normals, this seems like reasonably good news (even though it probably means hardly anyone will even read this post I'm writing right now). Part of me hates the new Facebook algorithm because work but part of me loves it because more family/friends can see my ridic selfies again. Like many others, I joined Facebook back in the day to stay connected to other humans, not to any particular newspaper or charming viral news site. I was home with a new baby, feeling isolated and overwhelmed by the challenges of new motherhood. I reconnected with long-lost friends, some of whom were already new moms and understood what the hell I was going through.  When I was struggling to breastfeed, an old friend gave me some advice on Facebook about getting a lactation consultant. I had not known that such persons existed. In the middle of the night, awake with a baby, the site was not only a great distraction but a comfort -- there were people out there who were up with babies, too! They were talking to me.  I was following the news, too, at the time. Not on Facebook. Publishers hadn’t yet really caught on to the site’s massive audience or power. I dutifully visited news sites, like everyone else. That was all fine and good, but reading the news online didn’t make me feel better; it certainly didn’t make me feel less alone.   In recent years, as more of us connect to the Internet on smartphones, fewer of us visit those news websites anymore. Most people look at texts, maybe email, and then open the Facebook app. News organizations went where the people were: to Facebook. They’ve leaned heavily on the massive social network of more than 1 billion daily active users. As a result, a lot of Americans get news from Facebook -- about 142 million of us, according to Pew. The site is ""far and away the most popular source of news about government and politics,"" Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times. Over the past year, I’ve come to find Facebook kind of overwhelming and corporate. Maybe it’s because I’m a journalist and have followed too many institutional accounts over the years, but my feed has become crowded with post after post from newspapers or websites offering the hottest takes on whatever story is raging that day. As Donald Trump has risen to prominence recently, it’s become suffocating. How many stories about one man's ill-advised taco salad tweet does a woman need to read?  The same held true for more important stories, too. Do I need 50 takes on the Brexit? I do not.  Like many others, I turned to Instagram (which Facebook owns). Others now go to Snapchat. Facebook has been wringing its hands recently as more people turn away from the site toward other less news-driven social networks. At the same time, fewer users were sharing personal status updates, photos and videos. Those shares are more critical to Facebook's business than the news. ""Personal updates—including the half-based opinions, but also the baby photos, engagement announcements, and vacation photos—are what keep people coming back to Facebook,"" Erin Griffith noted in April, writing for Fortune. Without those users, the whole ad-based business of Facebook would collapse. In its announcement, Facebook emphasized its commitment to its original purpose: ""connecting people with their friends and family.""  It's a familiar theme for all those folks in the media freaking out today.  There’s a bit of hand-wringing now that, in light of Tuesday’s announcement that Americans will see less “news” and more pics of babies and puppies, the public will grow less informed. (My colleague Damon Beres convincingly makes that case.) It's really too early to tell how this change will look. It might mean we see just a smidge less news, as Beres writes. So, no big deal. And if you think about the level of discourse on Facebook, you’d have to realize that getting our news on a social network is a dubious, possibly even dangerous, proposition. The Facebook algorithm shows you what you like to see, and when you’re talking about news -- particularly political news -- that means liberals get a liberal spin on the news, while conservatives get the opposite. Most people live online in little Facebook silos. That helps further polarize Americans, who could arguably use a little less polarization these days. (See: Congress.) ""Facebook users do indeed ... tend to engage in creating echo chambers, encasing themselves in environments that mesh with their own personal beliefs while rejecting other viewpoints,"" researchers concluded in a paper published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Others have made similar arguments. Those echo chambers can have the disastrous results, the researchers argued -- spreading the idea, for example, that global warming isn't real or that Sept. 11 was a U.S. government conspiracy.  I'd much rather spread the idea that my kids looked extremely adorable last weekend.  Read the other side of the argument: Facebook Just Gave The Finger To Millions Of People Who Use It For News",TECH,TECH
China Marks Another Milestone In Quest To Become Space Superpower,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China launched its first privately developed rocket from a launchpad in northwestern China on Thursday, state media said, the latest milestone in the country’s ambitious space exploration program. Since coming to office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made becoming a “space flight superpower” a top priority for the Chinese government, which has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022. The launch of the “Chongqing Liangjiang Star” rocket, developed by OneSpace Technology, a Beijing-based private firm, marks the first time a non-state Chinese rocket has successfully entered orbit, the official Xinhua news agency said. The rocket is powered by a solid fuel engine developed by OneSpace and its control systems are customizable in accordance with user demand, the company’s chairman, Ma Chao, told Xinhua. Also known as the OS-XO, the craft can place a 100-kilogram load into orbit 800 kilometers from the earth, according to state media. The rocket uses energy-saving technology, such as wireless communications instead of wired internet that by cutting weight has helped lower fuel costs by about 30 percent, Xinhua said. Founded in 2015, OneSpace is the result of a government effort to foster China’s commercial space flight and encourage private participation in the sector, according to state media. The company expects 10 missions for carrier rockets in 2019, founder Shu Chang told the official China Daily last week. “I hope we can become one of the biggest small-satellite launchers in the world,” Shu said. Last year, the company signed a deal with the state-run Chongqing Liangjiang Aviation Industry Investment Group to build a joint research and manufacturing base in the southwestern city of Chongqing. The base’s strategic location as part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, a key foreign policy initiative by Xi that aims to develop trade links between China and Eurasia, will provide a large export market for OneSpace, Shu told China Daily. “We will develop bigger rockets in the future and participate in the global competition,” Shu said.

The Rise Of Nick Foles: How A Journeyman QB Became A Super Bowl Hero,"MINNEAPOLIS – Surrounded by cameras and a sudden bandwagon of well-wishers, Nick Foles tried to bulldoze his way up the U.S. Bank tunnel. He clutched the hand of his wife Tori, who herself held their daughter Lily. The world suddenly wanted a word with Nick Foles, the discarded, unheralded, former backup Eagles quarterback who had just outdueled Tom Brady to lead Philadelphia to a 41-33 Super Bowl win. It was all coming fast now, after always coming slow for the Foles family. For so long, it was just them, scraping and questioning and, in the end, believing. Believing in Nick. Believing in themselves and in their faith and in the idea that, sure, this outlandish, outrageous night out of their wildest dreams was possible. An NFL employee tried to help them through the throng by promising there’d be plenty of time to talk with the Philadelphia quarterback. “Nick Foles,” it was shouted, “is going to the MVP room.” With that, Nick and Tori shot each other a look and a smile. It’s reasonable to assume Nick Foles didn’t know there was such a thing as a Super Bowl MVP interview room, let alone that such a sentence would ever be declared. Yet there were the Foles, Nick and Tori, a mostly anonymous couple out of the University of Arizona, marching right onto turf more familiar with Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen. Two years ago Foles was ready to retire from football at age 26, frustrated with his situation, lacking in his motivation, uncertain either would ever improve. Sunday, he outdueled Brady in one of the wildest Super Bowls ever. He threw for 373 yards and three touchdowns. He added a 1-yard touchdown reception on an all-timer of a trick play. Mostly though, he played with the poise and focus that belied the fact that until franchise quarterback Carson Wentz was injured in December, Foles was nothing but a backup, a journeyman, another name in the NFL’s parade of mediocre QBs. When Wentz got hurt though, in came Foles. When the Eagles got here and found themselves in a shootout with Brady, who would chuck it for a record 505 yards and three touchdowns of his own, Foles never blinked. “The stage is never too big for him,” said tight end Zach Ertz, who caught the game-deciding touchdown pass. “I didn’t have to be Superman,” Foles said. “I have amazing teammates.” He was Superman though. And that was the thing. The Eagles didn’t win because of a superior defense and a mistake-free day by a game manager of a quarterback. Brady was slashing the defense apart. They needed someone to do the same. They needed someone to be better than Brady. So there was Foles, moving the Eagles up and down the field to the tune of 538 total yards. There was Foles, throwing brilliant passes – a 34-yard touchdown to Alshon Jeffrey, a 22-yard bullet to Corey Clement. There was Foles, leading an offense that went 10-of-16 on third down, and 2-of-2 on fourth, including a conversion on the game-winning drive. There was Foles, running a fake-audible-turned-Wildcat-reverse pass back to Foles for a touchdown. There was Foles, providing the battered and gasping defense with enough hope to know it needed to make just one play, one stop and the Super Bowl could be Philly’s. It came with 2:16 remaining, a strip sack of Brady after the Patriots hadn’t punted or turned it over all night. It wasn’t much. With Nick Foles at the helm, it was enough. And so there was Nick Foles, in the “MVP room”, waiting for a chance to speak to the media. First he took a seat next to Tori and held Lily on his lap. The baby wore a green Eagles scarf across her head and pink, noise-cancelling head phones over her ears. He pulled a silver chain out from underneath his jersey and she began played with the cross at the end of it. He was still wearing his uniform and his baseball cap said the Eagles had won the Super Bowl. Other than that, he looked as calm as ever, just a dad and his family. Which was, he said, how this all worked in the first place. “That’s what life’s about right there,” Foles said. “We’re Super Bowl champs, but time does stop when you look in your daughter’s eyes and you get to celebrate this moment. I got to look in my wife’s eyes. I get to celebrate this with her. They’ve been there. My wife’s been there through everything. My family has been through everything. “I’m just grateful.” Foles grew up in Texas and originally attended Michigan State before transferring to Arizona, in part to find playing time. There he met Tori, a volleyball player for the Wildcats. He was a third-round pick, and despite a Pro Bowl season in 2013 in Philadelphia, he was never anyone’s idea of a sure-fire star. Injuries held him to just eight games in 2014. He wound up on a bad St. Louis Rams team in 2015. That’s when he was ready to quit. Football had been fun. It was never going to be like he dreamt it though. Instead he went fishing, prayed a lot and leaned on his family. He decided to give it another shot. A year in Kansas City restored his enthusiasm, but did little for his career. Returning to Philly this year, he was second-string, an insurance policy that few thought could cash in like this. All along though, he continued to believe and make others around him believe. “He’s just the real deal,” said Dan Moore, his father-in-law. “He’s just a great person and even when he was ready to retire, I always believed he had the talent to be a star in this league, physically and mentally.” He just needed his chance. Foles credits his faith for offering calm and perspective. Maybe he wasn’t having a career like Brady. He was still in the NFL, still chasing something, still surrounded by that family of his. This game was a microcosm of his career. Little expected, except by him. Overlooked when compared to the other guy. Nothing to lean on but himself, his faith and those around him. When you’re blessed with that, Foles said, a fourth-quarter drive when trailing the vaunted Patriots is nothing. “I was really staying in the moment,” Foles said. “Just staying in the moment.” Off to the side Tori smiled and Lily sat quietly. It all seemed so normal, a pack of media asking about this pass or that play, about besting Tom Brady, about winning the Super Bowl. If the rest of the world was surprised, they didn’t appear to be. Nick Foles was in the MVP room. Of course, he was.   More Super Bowl coverage from Yahoo Sports:• Eagles beat Patriots in epic Super Bowl LII• Foles’ improbable journey ends with Super Bowl MVP• Gronk on retirement: ‘I’m going to look at my future’• Black screen leaves Super Bowl viewers baffled• NFL’s catch rule factors into Eagles’ game-winning TD This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Why Everyone Should Just Stop Yelping,"The story of former Yale dean June Y. Chu, who left her position after students discovered her disparaging Yelp! reviews hit home. We both received undergraduate degrees from Bryn Mawr College. Some of the words in her offensive posts I heard from my immigrant father. I’m sure I parroted him when I was growing up. Worse, I internalized from his world view a false sense of “otherness” or “superiority,” something I’ve struggled to address over the years. Furthermore I had been an “Elite” Yelper until I caught onto the company’s business practices. The extensive coverage of Ms. Chu’s misstep hasn’t addressed why she, a highly educated person with a PhD, was Yelping in the first place? Why did she, according to the Yale Daily News, announce in a college-wide e-mail that she had become “Yelp! Elite”? I can tell you why I once Yelped a lot. I moved to Colorado in 2008 without knowing many people. A date took me to a Yelp! Elite party, with salsa dancing, tequila, food, cigars and swag. Afterwards, we went out for dessert. He encouraged me to write a review of the dessert place, my third for the site. We stopped dating, but I kept reviewing. The Yelp! platform acted as a chronicle of my new life. I enjoyed letting others know if a restaurant or shop was amazing or needed improvement. As a former small business owner myself, I tried to be balanced and fair. At some point, without telling me exactly why, Yelp! granted me Elite status. They put a badge next to my name, like a gold star awarded in elementary school. Now I could invite friends to parties, the theater and cocktail gatherings and meeting other foodies. I enjoyed the perks for a time. Then it dawned on me: If I weren’t willing to spend my own money to see these performances or visit a particular restaurant, why would I accept them as compensation for having written lots of reviews? How could I know if these businesses willingly hosted us, or if they had succumbed to Yelp!’s pressure to feed and entertain dozens of “Elites” or else suffer the consequences of not being on the Yelp! radar? The bigger Yelp! became, the harder it was to ignore. When Yelp! began asking its members to commit to writing 100 reviews a year, more of my alarm bells went off. That’s about two reviews a week, a lot of free content to provide to a publicly traded company now worth roughly $2.4 billion. How many people, unless they travel a great deal, visit two new businesses a week? To meet the 100 quota, Yelpers offer their two cents on gas stations, Starbucks, convenience stores, or, like Ms. Chu, a local cinema, establishments that once were off the review radar. Would she have bothered to critique them at all if Yelp! didn’t offer the carrot of Elite status? It is hard to know what “Elite” even means, given that Ms. Chu achieved the status while using language in posts that Yale deemed “reprehensible”. She did apologize for the words she used. Still, Yelp! allowed her snarky and mean-spirited content to stand, thereby condoning it and setting the tone for future reviews and the next crop of “Elite” Yelpers, who can continue to rack up perks for writing up service infractions and imperfections. How does that benefit anyone? Ms. Chu, by virtue of being a dean at one of America’s most prestigious universities, had already achieved a high place in society. That she apparently sabotaged her actual status by celebrating her faux “elite” status in a campus e-mail is mind boggling and heartbreaking. Why did such an accomplished woman feel the need to broadcast a random designation by a for-profit business? Was it the word “elite” itself that was so compelling to her? Did the need to be chosen or special run so deep? My heart goes out to her if that is the case. I ceased Yelping years ago and later deleted my account. When I feel compelled to share a noteworthy experience or offer a mild critique of a place I’d like to see succeed, I’ll do so on Google or on the Facebook page of the place I visited. In a polarized country, where Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment might have cost her the election, it’s safe to say that name calling doesn’t work. Kind and constructive feedback, especially if delivered in person or privately, often leads to improvement, a win-win. While we need to feel free to voice respectful opinions, using one’s privilege to write one star reviews of employees (and fellow patrons), and potentially jeopardize someone’s livelihood, is a waste if not an abuse of that privilege. Feeding Yelp! with content just legitimizes a business with sketchy practices and normalizes the cheapening of labor, which Yelp! disguises under the cover of “community”. Why don’t we just stop?

Is There Any Way To Stop Ad Creep?," Ethics lawyers and historians have argued that Donald Trump has blurred the line between his public office and private business interests in an unprecedented fashion.    In another sense, it’s part of a much larger social trend.   Commercial entreaties – whether in the form of magazine ads, radio jingles or television spots – have long been a part of modern life. But advertising is now encroaching on public space as never before.   Cities and states now grant businesses the right to put their names and logos on parking meters, bridges, fire hydrants – even lifeguard swimsuits. Public parks intended to offer a respite from the travails of daily life now allow retailers to advertise amidst historical sites and nature preserves. School boards ink deals with all sorts of businesses to help them meet their budgetary needs.  It’s not just public space that is filling up with brand shout-outs. In conducting research for a new book on modern marketing and its regulation, I discovered that a host of once ad-free environments – from the living room to our friendships – are now becoming sites for ads or surveillance technologies designed to make them more effective.   Some might shrug, calling the ad creep an inevitable part of modern life. But there are dangers to this trend, along with legal remedies – if people care enough to actually do something.   New marketing techniques and technologies allow businesses to reach consumers in new ways and venues. One space becoming increasingly critical to market researchers is the home.   Smart technologies – from Microsoft’s Xbox One to Vizio televisions – now come embedded with what could be described as “spying” capabilities. These devices can record activities once considered private, like the movies we decide to watch and even our facial expressions while playing a video game. This information becomes part of a digital profile used by advertisers to get a better portrait of who we are and how we can be convinced to make a purchase.   Meanwhile, every time we sign on to Facebook or search Google on our personal computers or smartphones, we are adding to vast stockpiles of market research. This kind of surveillance is hard to escape. Marketers have moved past cookies: They can now identify individual users from the number of fonts in their browser or the rate at which their particular computer’s battery loses its charge.  Even our brains have become fair game for advertising annexation. A landmark 2004 study asked subjects to take sips of Coke and Pepsi while a machine measured blood flow in their brains. When the brand was a secret, participants expressed a slight preference for Pepsi. But when the brand names were revealed before taking a sip, participants, both verbally and neurologically, revealed a preference for Coke. The study was widely heralded as proof of the ability of advertising to actually change our brain chemistry, to instill emotional markers that can trump objective evaluation of the actual product.  Since then, companies have spent millions to record activity in consumers’ brains to better capture the desires we won’t or can’t articulate. Some major ad campaigns we currently see – from Samsung to Campbell’s soup – reflect the results from this new neuromarketing research.  Our friendships and social networks aren’t immune. Marketers target “micro-influencers” – often people with modest Instagram or Twitter followings – that can be leveraged to sell products or services on social media. While Federal Trade Commission rules require endorsers to acknowledge the compensation they receive in return for giving favorable plugs for a product, enforcement is minimal.      Even those bullish about these new marketing gambits do admit that they can be annoying. Still, a common response to complaints about the growing presence of ads is “What’s the harm?” As the argument goes, being annoyed is a small price to pay for subsidized public infrastructure, free online content and exposure to ads more attuned to our actual interests and needs.  My research shows, however, that there are significant costs to opening up our lives to advertisers. One is a loss of consumer agency. Reliance on brain scans to design more effective commercials strips audiences of their ability to consciously shape the advertising content they see and hear. Market research used to rely on focus groups and surveys, not the unfiltered disclosure of brain activity. The result can be advertising campaigns that celebrate biases or behaviors we would rather keep hidden from view. For example, thanks to data gleaned from brain scans, Frito-Lay launched a series of ads encouraging antisocial practices like intentionally putting Cheetos in another person’s load of white laundry. When directly questioned, sample viewers objected to the ads’ gleeful embrace of vandalism, but MRI readings told a different story.   Another cost comes from how advertising can change an environment’s character.    The civic values meant to be instilled by public schooling now must compete with the materialist messages of the sporting goods stores and clothing retailers that advertise in cafeterias and hallways. The use of micro-influencers on social media could make us less trusting, never knowing if that online friend is really a corporate shill.   And as commercial spying becomes routine, norms change to permit snooping in other parts of our life. Witness the recent use of facial recognition technology by churches to record the attendance rates of their parishioners and the placement of monitoring devices on once-innocuous objects like Barbie dolls and children’s toothbrushes so parents can keep tabs on their children.      So what’s to be done? It isn’t realistic for consumers to abandon Google, to drop off of Facebook, to take their kids out of public school or to stop using public infrastructure. Halfhearted measures – like regulations requiring consumers to opt in to some of these troubling advertising practices – won’t do much to change things either. Studies show that such legislative nudges don’t work, that motivated marketers can get us to opt in if they apply enough pressure.    Instead of defaults, the law needs to create hard and fast rules preventing the entry of advertising and corporate spying into these spaces. This kind of reform doesn’t require a sea change in legal attitudes. The history of advertising regulation in the United States reveals several episodes where lawmakers moved to put an end to objectionable selling strategies fueled by new technologies.    The American right to privacy emerged in the late 19th century as a response to advertisers using the relatively new technology of photography to take pictures of people without their permission, and then using these photos to sell products. Judges objected to this forced blending of the personal with the commercial, with one court equating the practice to enslavement by a “merciless master.” Similar objections caused lawmakers to act against a barrage of scenery-obscuring billboards in the early 20th century and subliminal advertising in the 1950s. Of course, not every new advertising strategy has met with a legal response. But the historical record shows strong precedent for using the law to keep some areas of life off limits from commercial entreaties.  A normalization process can easily occur once advertising enters a new territory. Take pre-film advertising in movie theaters. When it was first introduced in the 1990s, audiences howled at the presence of commercials before the trailers and the actual movie. Lawsuits were filed and new legislation proposed to stop the practice. But over time, the lawsuits and legislation sputtered out. Surveys now suggest that audiences have become ambivalent to the presence of pre-film commercials.  The story of pre-film ads should be a cautionary tale. Without a coordinated effort, this same normalization process will take place in more and more spaces, engulfing them into the vast, existing space of commercial white noise.

The Company Behind 'Final Fantasy' Is Making A New Game For ... Apple Watch,"You probably wouldn’t put the Apple Watch in the same category as a PlayStation 4, but one of the world’s most beloved video game publishers is going to try. Square Enix, the company behind franchises like “Final Fantasy” and “Dragon Quest,” announced Thursday that it is developing a new role-playing game for the Apple Watch. It’s called “Cosmos Rings” and it’s expected to release in Japan this summer. The company says it’s the “world’s first” RPG made fully for the Apple Watch. That’s arguable: There have been other RPGs that run on the device, like “Watch Quest!” and “Runeblade,” but “Cosmos Rings” could be the first that doesn’t require an iPhone. Apple introduced Apple Watch-native apps with watchOS 2 last fall. The Apple Watch screen is dinky compared to the iPhone ― let alone a television ― but the move makes more sense than you’d think. According to recent analysis, the Apple Watch, an iPhone-connected accessory launched by the tech giant last year, is a $10 billion business. “Apple isn’t walking or jogging but sprinting ahead with Apple Watch,” Neil Cybart, an Apple analyst who runs the Above Avalon blog, wrote in a post last month. Square Enix has also been keen on expanding its mobile gaming options. The company has released iOS and Android versions of classic games like “Final Fantasy VII,” “Secret of Mana” and “Dragon Quest III,” in addition to smartphone-only entries like “Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius.”  Mobile gaming is expected to generate $35 billion in revenue this year, according to an analysis from Deloitte. That’s more than “traditional” PC gaming and console gaming, though mobile gaming is also much more competitive ― the average smartphone game makes a lot less money than PC or console games, that same analysis said. As for the amount of money an Apple Watch RPG can make ― we’ll just have to see. H/T TechnoBuffalo",TECH,TECH
Opera Web Browser Introduces Anti-Censorship Tool,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Norwegian online browser and advertising firm Opera Software ASA has embedded a tool aimed at circumventing censorship into its latest desktop app, potentially complicating a bid for the company by a consortium from China, which censors the Internet. The consortium, which includes web search and security firm Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd and Beijing Kunlun Tech Co, has offered $1.28 billion for Opera. Qihoo 360 and Kunlun declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday about whether Opera's new tool might affect its bid. A spokesman for Opera also declined to comment. Opera said on its blog on Thursday the newest version of its desktop Internet browser, targeted at developers, includes a free built-in Virtual Private Network (VPN), a common tool for getting round online censorship, with unlimited data usage. ""Everyone deserves to be private online if they want to be,"" said Krystian Kolondra, a senior vice president at Opera, on the company's official blog. Opera users get ""easier access to all their favorite online content no matter where they are,"" he said. In February, Opera CEO Lars Boilesen told tech news site TechCrunch that selling to the Chinese group was not his decision, but up to Opera's shareholders. Chinese internet companies are required to censor any content that the ruling Communist Party deems unlawful, a sweeping power which has been used to block content that clashes with the official party line. China frequently upgrades its internet censorship mechanism, widely considered the world's most sophisticated and known as the Great Firewall. This has often rendered VPNs impotent in China. It was not immediately clear whether Opera's new tool would be able to circumvent such restrictions. Last week, the Chinese consortium extended its offer for Opera to May 24, the latest deadline possible, as it had received acceptances from shareholders below the required level. The deal also needs to be approved by Chinese and U.S. authorities.

8 Stupid Office Rules That Drive Everyone Crazy,"Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. I understand the temptation. As my company has grown, so has our difficulty maintaining standards. There have been many instances where someone crossed a line, and we were tempted to respond with a new rule that applied to everyone. But that’s where most companies blow it. In just about every instance, upon closer inspection, we realized that establishing a new rule would be a passive and morale-killing way to address the problem. The vast majority of the time, the problem needs to be handled one-on-one by the employee’s manager. When companies create ridiculous and demoralizing rules to halt the outlandish behavior of a few individuals, it’s a management problem. There’s no sense in alienating your entire workforce because you don’t know how to manage performance. It makes a bad situation that much worse. Here are some of the worst rules that companies create when they fall into this trap. 1. Bell curves and forced rankings of performance. Some individual talents follow a natural bell-shaped curve, but job performance does not. When you force employees to fit into a pre-determined ranking system, you do three things: 1) incorrectly evaluate people’s performance, 2) make everyone feel like a number, and 3) create insecurity and dissatisfaction when performing employees fear that they’ll be fired due to the forced system. This is yet another example of a lazy policy that avoids the hard and necessary work of evaluating each individual objectively, based on his or her merits. 2. Ridiculous requirements for attendance, leave, and time off. People are salaried for the work they do, not the specific hours they sit at their desks. When you ding salaried employees for showing up five minutes late even though they routinely stay late and put in time on the weekend, you send the message that policies take precedence over performance. It reeks of distrust, and you should never put someone on salary that you don’t trust. When companies are unnecessarily strict in requiring documentation for bereavement and medical leave, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of employees who deserve better. After all, if you have employees who will fake a death to miss a day’s work, what does that say about your company? 3. Restricting internet use. There are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and I’m not talking about Facebook. But once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, it’s a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line. Most companies draw it in the wrong place. People should be able to kill time on the Internet during breaks. When companies unnecessarily restrict people’s Internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that can’t check Facebook; it limits people’s ability to do their jobs. Many companies restrict Internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. The most obvious example? Checking the Facebook profile of someone you just interviewed. 4. Banning mobile phones. If I ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? Ya, right. Organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who won’t take advantage of things. They also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform and/or violate expectations (such as spending too much time on their phones). This is also hard work, but it’s worth it. The easy, knee-jerk alternative (banning phones) demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work. 5. Draconian e-mail policies. This is a newer one that’s already moving down a slippery slope. Some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message. Again, it’s about trust. If you don’t trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? In trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. And guess what? The bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place. 6. Stealing employees’ frequent-flyer miles. If there’s one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, it’s their frequent flier miles. When employers don’t let people keep their miles for personal use, it’s a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. Work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. Taking employees’ miles sends the message that you don’t appreciate their sacrifice and that you’ll hold on to every last dollar at their expense. 7. Pathetic attempts at political correctness. Maintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world that’s rife with animosity and discrimination. Still employers have to know where to draw the line. Going on a witch-hunt because someone says “Bless you” to another employee that sneezed (real example) creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other. 8. Shutting down self-expression (personal items and dress code). Many organizations control what people can have at their desks. A life-size poster of a shirtless Fabio? I get it; that’s a problem. But employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items they’re allowed to place on their desks. Once again, it’s the ol’ “If I could just hire robots I wouldn’t have this problem” approach. Same goes for dress codes. They work well in private high schools, but they’re unnecessary at work. Hire professionals and they’ll dress professionally. When someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. Otherwise, you’re making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively. Bringing It All Together If companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we’ll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work.

Leaders Of Top Robotics And AI Companies Call For Ban On Killer Robots,"By Ariel Conn Founders of AI/robotics companies, including Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, OpenAI) and Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman (Google’s DeepMind), call for autonomous weapons ban, as the United Nations delays negotiations. Leaders from AI and robotics companies around the world have released an open letter calling on the United Nations to ban autonomous weapons, often referred to as killer robots. Founders and CEOs of nearly 100 companies from 26 countries signed the letter, which warns: In December, 123 member nations of the U.N. had agreed to move forward with formal discussions about autonomous weapons, with 19 members already calling for an outright ban. However, the next stage of discussions, which were originally scheduled to begin on Aug. 21 ― the release date of the open letter ― were postponed because a small number of nations hadn’t paid their fees. The letter was organized and announced by Toby Walsh, a prominent AI researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. In an email, he noted that, “sadly, the U.N. didn’t begin today its formal deliberations around lethal autonomous weapons.” Walsh continued: The open letter included such signatories as: In reference to the signatories, the press release for the letter added: “Their companies employ tens of thousands of researchers, roboticists and engineers, are worth billions of dollars and cover the globe from North to South, East to West: Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, U.K., United Arab Emirates and USA.” Bengio explained why he signed, saying, “the use of AI in autonomous weapons hurts my sense of ethics.” He added that the development of autonomous weapons “would be likely to lead to a very dangerous escalation,” and that “it would hurt the further development of AI’s good applications.” He concluded his statement to the Future of Life Institute saying that this “is a matter that needs to be handled by the international community, similarly to what has been done in the past for some other morally wrong weapons (biological, chemical, nuclear).” Stuart Russell, another of the world’s preeminent AI researchers and founder of Bayesian Logic Inc., added: Ryan Gariepy, founder & CTO of Clearpath Robotics was the first to sign the letter. For the press release, he noted, “Autonomous weapons systems are on the cusp of development right now and have a very real potential to cause significant harm to innocent people along with global instability.” The open letter ends with similar concerns. It states: The letter was announced in Melbourne, Australia at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which draws many of the world’s top artificial intelligence researchers. Two years ago, at the last IJCAI meeting, Walsh released another open letter, which called on countries to avoid engaging in an AI arms race. To date, that previous letter has been signed by over 20,000 people, including over 3,100 AI/robotics researchers. Read the letter here.",SCIENCE,TECH

Top Alpine Skiers Shun Team Event At 2018 Olympics,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The Alpine skiing team event looks like lacking in star quality when it makes its Olympic debut in Pyeongchang this week after Lindsey Vonn became the latest high-profile athlete to say she probably won’t be taking part. The inaugural team event is scheduled for Saturday as the climax to the program and will bring mixed sex competition, knockout racing and parallel skiing to the Olympic Alpine slopes for the first time. Marcel Hirscher, who has claimed two gold medals in Pyeongchang, ruled out competing for Austria before the start of the Olympics because he felt it would compromise his bid to win a seventh successive World Cup overall title. Norwegian speed racers Aksel Lund Svindal, the men’s downhill champion, and Kjetil Jansrud have headed back to Europe after the completion of their individual events. American Teg Ligety said he would race in the event if overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin did, but on Sunday he confirmed his run in the men’s giant slalom had brought an end to his Pyeongchang Olympics. “I was an absolute no before but I was thinking about it,” Vonn said on Monday. “But now Ted’s gone and Mikaela is not doing it and so I don’t really think we have a strong chance of getting a medal since none of our top athletes are doing it so I probably won’t.” Hirscher, favorite to win a third gold in the men’s slalom on Thursday, had said competing in the team event would allow him insufficient time to get to Slovenia for the resumption of the World Cup next week. “It would be a big honor to start for Austria but... it is not possible,” the 28-year-old said. “If you do the team event, four days later you are back in Europe at Kranjska Gora in the giant slalom, no time for preparation, no time for recovery, no time for getting used to European time. “So, it would be great to be there but if I’m professional, it is not possible.” The team event, an attempt by the governing International Ski Federation to refresh the Alpineprogram, will be contested by 16 teams on a knockout basis with the winners of the final round taking gold.

Philadelphia Eagles Beat New England Patriots For First Super Bowl Win,"MINNEAPOLIS – In the wildest shootout in Super Bowl history, unheralded Nick Foles outdueled legendary Tom Brady to lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl title, defeating the New England Patriots, 41-33. Foles went 28 for 43 for 373 yards and three touchdowns, including leading a come-from-behind, game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. A back-up most of the season to Carson Wentz, Foles was particularly brilliant when it mattered the most, on third and fourth downs in clutch situations. He even caught a touchdown pass at the end of the first half. New England somehow lost despite never punting or turning the ball over. Brady, seeking his sixth championship, broke his own Super Bowl record for most passing yards with 505. He went 28-for-48 and tossed XX touchdowns. Brady was brilliant. It was Foles who was the champion and Super Bowl MVP though. Trailing for the first time in the game, 33-32 with 9:26, Foles led the Philly offense on a legendary game-winning drive. It included converting twice on third down and once on fourth down, often by the smallest of margins. It ended with a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zach Ertz, who leapt across the goal line. Ertz lost the ball on contact with the field just after he crossed the goalline. Replay ruled it a catch, determining he had made a football move and became a runner therefore the play was dead when the ball crossed the plane of the end zone. In the third quarter, Foles hit running back Corey Clement on a 22-yard dime into double coverage. The running back initially controlled the ball, bobbled it a bit and then appeared to fail to get both feet in the end zone. Initially ruled a touchdown, it was upheld on a controversial replay review and brought one of the NFL’s most tired storylines – what’s a catch – to the Super Bowl. After the Ertz score gave Philly the lead, Brady got the ball back with 2:21 remaining in the game, spurring thoughts of another dramatic Patriots comeback. Not this time, though. The Eagles defense stepped up when Brandon Graham strip-sacked Brady, causing a fumble that was recovered by the Eagles. Philly kicked a field goal to extend the lead to eight. With 1:05 remaining, Brady then attempted to drive New England again for a touchdown and two-point conversion but couldn’t do it. It was the first sign of life by the Philly defense. New England, to that point, had neither punted, had a turnover or allowed a sack. That’s the Eagles though, opportunistic, confident and more than capable of standing up to the NFL’s biggest bully and punching back. The game was an offensive classic, setting multiple Super Bowl records, including most yards gained before the start of the fourth quarter. The Eagles led 22-12 after a wild, entertaining first half that saw a little bit of everything. There was 683 total yards. A brilliant 37-yard Foles-to-Jeffrey touchdown pass. A 46-yard Rex Burkhead catch and rumble. Tom Brady dropping a pass from Danny Amendola that hit him directly in the hands. Foles catching one for a touchdown on a daring fake-audible, wildcat snap, reverse, throw-back to the QB. Each team missed an extra point. Philly failed on a two-point conversion. New England had a bad snap cost them a field goal. Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks was knocked out of the game on a violent hit. There were gadget plays and huge gains galore. Corey Clement had a 53 yard catch and run for the Eagles. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for 36 and added a touchdown. New England saw Danny Amendola haul one in for 50 and Chris Hogan for 43. James White scored on a 26-yard run. The pregame festivities were mostly eventless. All players stood for the national anthem, as they have for the entire playoffs in a movement that had mostly faded away this season until it was rekindled by president Donald Trump in week three. Pink sang it well after taking out a throat lozenge just before performing. At halftime, Justin Timberlake performed a number of hit songs, including singing Purple Rain as the image of Prince, a beloved native of Minnesota who passed away last year, was projected onto a giant curtain inside U.S. Bank Stadium.   Read more from Yahoo Sports: Nick Foles shows no fear in Super Bowl, even when he caught a TD pass This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports.",SPORTS,SPORTS

Is The Left Having A Senior Moment?,"Last year, activist Michael Morrill found himself nearing retirement age and thinking more and more about about issues important to older Americans. Alarmed by President Donald Trump’s reactionary agenda and concerned about the comparatively small number of progressive advocacy groups focusing on seniors, he decided to take a stab at remedying that problem. Morrill, now 63, who founded and previously led the Pennsylvania affiliate of People’s Action, a national progressive advocacy group, gave his new grassroots organization an endearingly cheeky name: Greyroots Action.  He said he hopes to bring a slew of senior issues to the table by turning Greyroots Action into an “elder American” (his preferred term for senior citizens) version of MoveOn, which leverages its extensive member database to ally itself with a host of progressive causes. In these politically fraught times, the founding of a liberal advocacy group might not seem terribly groundbreaking. After all, the Trump administration has been a  lighting rod for progressives from virtually every major American demographic group. This White House has helped spur the Women’s March, the Immigrants’ March and the March for Our Lives and further galvanized Black Lives Matter, among other already extant movements.  What makes Greyroots notable is that there hasn’t been a similarly large-scale effort to mobilize older voters. To be sure, there is a long history of progressive coalition building that has appealed to seniors about preserving entitlements, and there are numerous organizations and coalitions aggressively focusing on these issues. Social Security Works, for one, is an influential progressive organization that advocates for bolstering safety net programs and has been organizing grassroots efforts to keep the issue of entitlement programs at the forefront of local elections.  However, Morrill wants to see senior groups engage in more of the the grand, nationwide coalition building and resource pooling that has helped fuel interest in other liberal resistance movements. The Women’s March partnered with powerful national groups like the American Federation of Teachers, the National Resource Defense Council and MoveOn. There is even a broad progressive coalition planning nationwide protests if Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller or meddles in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.   “There really wasn’t anything that was working to organize seniors in a way that was progressive and independent,” said Morrill, alluding to a number of unions and progressive groups that have senior-focused initiatives but aren’t wholly focused on older voters. In interviews with HuffPost, activists offered various reasons for the lack of a sweeping and coordinated mobilization of anti-Trump seniors. Some, including Morrill, pointed to the numerous but fragmented initiatives and organizations focused on seniors that already exist, saying that weaving all those together has proved difficult. Many praised the nation’s largest organization of retired Americans, AARP, for its work advocating against last year’s attempts to repeal Obamacare but noted that it does not engage in the same full-throated, picket-sign-wielding, on-the-ground activism as the Trump resistance. Reached for comment, AARP spokesman Colby Nelson disputed the notion that AARP isn’t vigorously pursuing its agenda.  “Every day, AARP works to protect seniors, advance the policy issues that matter most to them and hold politicians accountable,” said Nelson. “From keeping Social Security and Medicare cuts off the agenda to protecting people’s health care from numerous repeal attempts, AARP has fought and delivered for Americans 50-plus and their families for 60 years.” Other progressives said seniors are among the most politically active voters in the country, showing up to the polls at higher rates than other Americans. As many campaign managers will attest, retired political volunteers, with years of experience at work or home, are often among a campaign’s most valued supervols, or super volunteers. Andrea Miller, 64, who is a co-executive director of People Demanding Action, where she works on crafting messaging for promoting Social Security and Medicare, echoed Morrill’s concerns about expanding senior advocacy to include more than just protecting those programs. Miller, who has been working with the NAACP on get-out-the-vote initiatives aimed at older Americans of color, said such issues include repealing the numerous voter ID laws that have been proposed or enacted across the country, which disproportionately disenfranchise older voters, and mitigating the impact of student loan debt on older Americans, who often co-sign their children’s and grandchildren’s loans.  Nearly everyone who spoke with HuffPost agreed that Democrats and progressives need to develop a more aggressive long-term strategy to appeal to older voters, who voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton 52 to 45 percent in 2016.  “How are we going to change the minds of American elders who should naturally be progressive?” asked Morrill, who cited the popularity among seniors of keeping government control of entitlement programs that Republicans have been trying to privatize for years.  In this, demographics may be working to the left’s favor. A report published in April by the Center for American Progress, the Brookings Institution, the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Public Religion Research Institution, forecasted that African-Americans, a staunchly Democratic constituency, will make up an increasingly larger portion of the over-65 electorate in the next five presidential campaign cycles as the percentage of more conservative older white voters flatlines.  Activists also see an increasing  synergy between progressive seniors and the Medicare-for-all movement most recently popularized by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).  Jon Bauman, the president of the Social Security Works PAC (and perhaps best known as Bowzer from the 1970s rock band Sha Na Na), anticipates that senior citizens, the principal beneficiaries of Medicare, will play an increasingly crucial role in the movement to expand the medical insurance program to all Americans.  Bauman, 70, believes that should Trump or the Republican-controlled Congress make a major push at privatizing Social Security or Medicare, a large Women’s March–style movement of seniors could materialize across the country. Already, he says, he has seen an increased presence of seniors at campaign rallies.   “I think there is an impending sense of, ‘Oh, my God, this is not want I want to leave to my children and grandchildren’ that has activated seniors even beyond the level that they were before,” he said.  ",POLITICS,POLITICS

U.S. ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc expects to deploy flying taxi services in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Dubai in 2020, Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden said at the Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas. Uber’s flying taxis will be small, electric aircraft that takeoff and land vertically, or VTOL aircraft, enabling zero operational emissions and quiet enough to operate in cities without disturbing the neighbors. The company is working with Hillwood Properties to make four vertiports - VTOL hubs with multiple takeoff and landing pads, and charging infrastructure - for Uber in Dallas starting next year, Holden said. Uber has also teamed up with companies such as Bell Helicopter, Aurora, Pipistrel, Mooney and Embraer to make the flying taxis. The company, which has partnered with the Dubai government, expects to conduct passenger flights as part of the World Expo 2020 in Dubai. “What we’re doing with them is they’re going to be funding studies for demand modeling so that we can deeply understand pricing and network optimization in the Dubai area,” Holden said. Uber is valued at $68 billion and its investors include Goldman Sachs and GV, formerly known as Google Ventures . The ride-hailing service has recently been rocked by a number of setbacks, including detailed accusations of sexual harassment from a former female employee and a video showing Chief Executive Travis Kalanick harshly berating an Uber driver.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
"You Guys, There Is An Adorable Heart On The Sun","A giant sunspot has apparently turned on its love light, morphing into the shape of a heart. Known as AR2529, the dazzling area will face Earth for approximately one more week, according to The Washington Post. A sunspot is a region on the sun's surface that is temporarily cool and dark compared to the surrounding area. How cool could that be? According to NASA, ""the average surface temperature of the sun is 6000 degrees Celsius and ... sunspots are about 1500 degrees Celsius cooler than the area surrounding them (still very hot)."" Sunspots are known for being associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections, but this one has been relatively temperate outside of releasing a small CME on Sunday, Space.com reported. (NASA explains the difference between the two here.) According to Space.com, the region is the size of several planet Earths.

Polydactyl Cats: The Felines With Extra Toes,"From Vetstreet: Regular cats have five toes on their front feet and four on their back, for a total of 18. But polydactyl [pronounced pol-ee-dak-til] cats boast more toes, usually on their front feet. If the word ""polydactyl"" sounds like Greek to you, that’s because it is — the Greek root poly means ""many"" and daktylos means ""digits or toes."" The record holder for most toes was a kitty named Jake, who had a whopping 28. American writer Ernest Hemingway was a lover of polydactyl cats. He was given his first polydactyl cat, a white six-toed feline named Snowball, by a ship's captain; today, nearly 50 of Snowball's descendants still live at the Hemingway Home in Key West.  Polydactyl cats are known by many names, including “Hemingway cats,” a reference to Snowball and her famous owner. They are also referred to as “mitten cats,” “big-foot cats” and “six-toed cats” — or even “cats with thumbs.” Common Questions
New York veterinarian Dr. Arnold Plotnick of Manhattan Cat Specialists tells us a little more about polydactyl cats, including his own, Mittens. Why do some cats have more toes than others? Some cats have extra toes because they inherit a gene that codes for polydactylism. If one parent is polydactyl and one parent has normal feet, then 40 to 50 percent of the kittens will also be polydactyl. What is thumb cat polydactyly? Most polydactyl cats have extra toes that look like the other toes — there are just more of them. Thumb cat polydactyly is a condition where the first digit, or the dewclaw, is so large that it resembles a thumb. My cat, Mittens, has huge “thumbs” on both front feet. Which cats are more likely to be polydactyl? Right now, there’s no certain breed of cat that is more or less prone to being polydactyl. However, in the past, the original Maine Coon cats had a high incidence of polydactylism — about 40 percent. More on Vetstreet:

"NASA's Kepler Spacecraft In Emergency Mode, 75 Million Miles From Earth","NASA has declared an emergency after discovering that its planet-hunting Kepler Spacecraft, now millions of miles away, is not operating properly. NASA mission operations engineers learned that the spacecraft had switched into emergency mode during scheduled contact on Thursday, the agency announced on Friday. ""EM (emergency mode) is the lowest operational mode and is fuel intensive. Recovering from EM is the team's priority at this time,” NASA stated in a release.  The agency has not released an explanation for why the spacecraft would shift into emergency mode on its own. Unfortunately, its location -- 75 million miles from Earth -- is only making the situation more challenging for scientists. That distance makes real-time communication impossible.  ""Even at the speed of light, it takes 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back,"" NASA said. The spacecraft, launched in 2009 to seek out Earth-like planets with its telescope, was last confirmed to be fully operational on April 4. NASA scientists didn't discover that it was in emergency mode until they pointed Kepler's telescope toward the center of the Milky Way for a new mission. The spacecraft has had problems in the past. While it was designed to observe planets for up to six years, two of its reaction wheels failed four years into the mission, in 2013. As a result, it could no longer stay pointed at a target without drifting off course, NASA said. Fortunately, it had completed its primary mission by then, detecting nearly 5,000 exoplanets. Scientists were also able to find another use for the telescope, repurposing it for the new ""K2"" mission in 2014 so it can continue to search for exoplanets while conducting research on young stars, supernovae and other astronomical objects.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"David Dao, Dragged United Passenger, Suffered Broken Nose, Missing Teeth, Lawyer Says","A lawyer for Dr. David Dao, the United Airlines passenger who was violently removed from his seat Sunday on a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, said Thursday that his client suffered a broken nose, lost two front teeth and received a concussion during the traumatizing experience. A lawsuit from Dao, attorney Thomas Demetrio said, was “likely.”  “Here’s the law, real simple: If you’re going to eject a passenger, under no circumstances can it be done with unreasonable force or violence,” Demetrio said during a press conference. “That’s the law.” Demetrio is a high-powered Chicago lawyer whose firm focuses on medical negligence, airplane crashes and commercial litigation. His firm has amassed over $4 billion in verdicts and settlements, according to his website, and he has a reputation as a formidable attorney. Oooof I didn't realize that Dr. Dao had hired Tom Demetrio as his lawyer. I've dealt with Tom in the past. United is in for a rough ride. Dao “did in fact suffer a significant concussion as a result of disembarking that plane,” Demetrio said. “I can also tell you that he had a serious broken nose, injury to the sinuses, and he is gonna be undergoing, shortly, reconstructive surgery.” “Ultimately, long-term, hopefully there will not be any significant repercussions because of that,” he went on. “But he is shaken.” Agents initially said they had “no choice” but to remove Dao, 69, to make room for United employees on the flight. The company accused him of being “belligerent and disruptive,” but video shows Dao remaining calm in the moments leading up to the physical altercation. “I’m a physician and I have to work tomorrow at 8 o’clock,” Dao can be seen politely telling Chicago airport security officers in the footage.  However, authorities dragged a bloodied Dao off the plane as other passengers looked on in horror. @united @FoxNews @CNN not a good way to treat a Doctor trying to get to work because they overbooked pic.twitter.com/sj9oHk94Ik Dao’s removal led to a fierce public outcry against the airline, with even President Donald Trump calling the situation “horrible.” United CEO Oscar Munoz initially made things worse with a tone-deaf apology for “having to re-accommodate” customers. He followed that up with a more emphatic apology for “the truly horrific event,” promising that “we will do better.” “He was a paying passenger sitting in a seat in our aircraft, and no one should be treated that way, period,” Munoz said Wednesday of Dao. Demetrio called the company’s apology “staged.” United released a new statement on Thursday, again apologizing and promising not to involve law enforcement in future situations unless the need for “safety and security” calls for it. “This horrible situation has provided a harsh learning experience from which we will take immediate, concrete action,” the statement said. “We have committed to our customers and our employees that we are going to fix what’s broken so this never happens again.” Demetrio said Thursday that airlines ― United in particular ― have “bullied us” and “treated us less than we deserve.” “Are we gonna continue being treated like cattle, bullied?” Demetrio asked. “We all have enough angst for flying as it is.” Dao’s daughter Crystal also spoke at the press conference, thanking everyone for their support of her father. “What happened to my dad should have never happened to any human being, regardless of circumstance,” she said. “We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what had happened to him and to see what had happened to him. We hope that in the future nothing like this happens again.” This story has been updated with United’s latest statement and additional details from Demetrio’s press conference.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS

Takata Corp. Files For Bankruptcy Following Massive Airbag Recall,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Takata Corp, the firm at the center of the auto industry’s biggest ever product recall, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, and said it would be bought for $1.6 billion by U.S.-based rival Key Safety Systems. In the biggest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer, Takata faces tens of billions of dollars in costs and liabilities resulting from almost a decade of recalls and lawsuits. Its defective airbag inflators have been linked to at least 17 deaths around the world. Takata Americas, its U.S. arm, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Sunday with liabilities of $10 billion to $50 billion, while the Japanese parent and subsidiaries filed for protection with the Tokyo District Court early on Monday. Takata’s total liabilities stand at 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion), Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd estimated. Final liabilities would depend on the outcome of discussions with carmaker customers who have borne the bulk of the replacement costs, a lawyer for the company said. The filings open the door to the financial rescue by Key Safety Systems (KSS), a Michigan-based parts supplier owned by China’s Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. In a deal that took 16 months to hammer out, KSS agreed to take over Takata’s viable operations, while the remaining operations will be reorganized to continue churning out millions of replacement airbag inflators, the two firms said. Takata will also receive a $227 million lifeline from its main lender, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, in the form a debtor-in-possession financing. KSS would keep “substantially all” of Takata’s 60,000 employees in 23 countries and maintain its factories in Japan. The deal is meant to allow Takata to continue operating without interruptions and with minimal disruptions to its supply chain. “We believe taking these actions in Japan and the U.S. is the best way to address the ongoing costs and liabilities of the airbag inflator issues with certainty and in an organized manner,” Takata CEO Shigehisa Takada said in a statement. Takada said he and top management would resign “when the timing of the restructuring is set”. His family - which still has control of the 84-year-old company - likely would cease to be shareholders. Jason Luo, president and CEO of KSS, said in a statement the “underlying strength” of Takata’s business had not diminished despite the airbag recall, citing its skilled employee base, geographic reach and other safety products such as seat belts. The companies expect to seal definitive agreements for the sale in coming weeks and complete the twin bankruptcy processes in the first quarter of 2018. The filings have, however, not resolved all issues, as Takata still needs to reach agreements with its carmaker clients on how to divvy up recall costs. Honda Motor Co, once Takata’s biggest customer, said it had reached no final agreement on responsibilities for the recall. Like other Japanese automakers, Honda said it anticipated difficulties in recovering the bulk of its claims. “We are already beyond the point where there is room for negotiations or complications,” said Julie Boote, analyst at market researcher Pelham Smithers in London. ”(Automakers) know they’re not getting the money back but need the inflators.” Takata faces billions in lawsuits and recall-related costs to its clients, including Honda, BMW, Toyota Motor Corp, which have been paying recall costs to date. It also faces potential liabilities from class action lawsuits in the United States, Canada and other countries. Global transport authorities have ordered about 100 million inflators to be recalled, as the ammonium nitrate compound used to inflate has been found to become volatile with age and prolonged exposure to heat, causing the devices to explode. Industry sources have said that recall costs could climb to about $10 billion. Takata produces roughly one-quarter of all replacement inflators, according to Valient Market Research, making it a significant supplier for now even as many automakers have shunned the company for future contracts. Recall costs so far have pushed the company into the red for three years, and Monday’s bankruptcy filings marked a low point of a slow and steady downfall of Takata, which was founded as a textiles company in 1933 that used its weaving technology to make lifelines for parachutes. It began producing airbags in 1987 and at its peak became the world’s No. 2 producer of the safety product. It also produces one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally, along with other components. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said its shares would be delisted on July 27. The stock has collapsed 95 percent since January 2014 as the recalls mounted. ($1 = 111.3000 yen)    ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Restricting Immigration Won’t Make American Industries Great Again,"President Trump’s path to the White House was paved in part by his hardline approach to immigration. For Trump, “Making America Great Again” included not only stepping up enforcement against illegal immigration but also increasing restrictions on legal immigration. Trump’s rhetoric on illegal immigration has been overplayed in the media. And his supporters and critics have all weighed in on the merits and drawbacks of building a US/Mexican wall, enhanced enforcement against illegals within the US and the travel ban. But his proposed restrictions to legal immigration needs more attention, especially if making the economy great again is part of Trump’s plan. Other than the controversial travel ban, no law has yet passed nor executive order signed respecting legal immigration. But the message has been loud and clear: restrictions are coming. As far as can be gathered, some of the proposed measures restricting legal immigration include. But will such measures lead to economic growth? In a previous article, I addressed how US workers, especially those among Trump’s “forgotten voters” would in fact not be served by curbing immigration levels. I argued that more immigration not less, optimizes the US labor pool providing employers with incentives for hiring American. The reason for this is that American companies, when given the freedom to recruit from beyond the borders, can grow faster and reinvest their capital, freeing up more resources towards hiring and training more US workers. In other words, free trade in human resources benefits not only foreign workers and the companies that hire them, but has a dividend benefit to local labor. And as I argued, companies would always rather hire in their own backyard if and when they can. But what happens when immigration restrictions get in the way? When companies are unable to tap into the global labor pool when faced with labor shortages? The answer is clear. Entire industries shrink and so do prospects for employment. Restricting the cross-border flow of human capital has far reaching effects that are the opposite of what immigration legislation intends to achieve: to protect the American worker and wages. What we can learn from Canada  Take the case from our neighbors to the north. In a wrongheaded effort to “protect’ Canadian workers and their wages from global competition, the Canadian government initiated a “Canada-first” immigration policy which imposed greater restrictions on temporary foreign worker visas. This only served to amplify the already chronic labor shortage in this industry. Working in the meat industry is often a dirty and physically demanding experience. Although workers in that industry are eligible for health benefits, the starting pay is below Canada’s national average. Most processing plants in Canada, which are also major meat exporters, offer full health and dental benefits but hourly wages that start at around C$13-C$19 (US$9.90-US$14.50), below the national average for natural resource and agricultural workers. Canadians simply aren’t lining up for these jobs. Accordingly, Canadian meat processing plants needed to seek foreign talent to compensate for the domestic labor shortage. But due to increased visa restrictions imposed by the then conservative government, their efforts to hire globally were thwarted. Fortunately, the new Liberal government in Canada, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has promised to ease up on some visa restrictions as well as creating easier paths to permanent residency. If these changes occur, the Canadian meat industry may be saved. But as it stands, the industry continues to struggle under the weight of chronic labor shortages thanks to visa regulations. Canada’s story is telling. If Trump delivers on his promises to further restrict visa programs in the US, we can expect the same unfortunate outcomes. “These moves aren’t likely to create more jobs in US meat plants” according to David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University in Ames. Swenson estimated that one third of workers in processing plants in Iowa, the largest pork-producing state, are immigrants. And like in Canada, this largely immigrant labor force is in place because domestic workers prefer higher paying and less physically demanding jobs. America’s Tech Industry The US information and technology industry, worth an estimated mind-blowing 1.26 trillion dollars, will be significantly impacted if the Trump administration’s proposed visa restrictions come to light. President Trump has threatened to overhaul the H-1B program which is the largest visa program for allowing high-skilled foreign workers employment in the U.S. The H-1B visa is utilized by foreign college graduates with knowledge in a highly specialized field. Its establishment coincided with the rise of the internet, sending America’s need for skilled computer scientists skyrocketing. About half of the more than 120,000 H-1B visas granted in 2014 went to those working in computer related fields. That number may seem high but given the endless demand for skilled workers in IT, the current government quotas of H-1Bs fall short, leaving Silicone Valley scrambling to fill jobs. Further, H-1B visas are already difficult to obtain. Eligibility for these visas are reserved only for the highly educated and experienced and employers are required to muddle through endless red tape to secure approvals Yet Trump promises even tougher measures which will further hamstring the industry. And predictably, there’s been an outcry from industry leaders. Real Estate industry  While there’s general optimism in the air about Trump’s promises to lower taxes and to deregulate business, concerns have been voiced by the real-estate industry about his crackdown on immigration. Home builders are understandably concerned about possible labor shortages if Trump follows through on his protectionist rhetoric. The clear majority of homebuilder labor consists of immigrant labor. Much of it was lost during the housing crash, as workers moved on to different fields or left the country. Immigrants comprise close to 41 percent of the construction workforce in California and close to 40 percent in Texas, according to the Homebuilder’s Group “If America becomes more isolated and less open, it could actually chill international demand for U.S. luxury housing,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at the housing data firm Redfin. “[Trump] is going to have to square his immigration policy with the reality that foreign buyers are a critical part of the housing market.” The unavoidable effect of labor shortages are declines in inventory resulting in higher prices. The real-estate industry is no exception to the laws of economics and last thing we need is another real estate bubble driven this time by labor shortages caused by immigration central planning. Many other American industries are at risk if stricter immigration policies become a reality. If the White House makes it even harder for foreign workers to offer their talents to the United States especially when other countries are opening doors, the US will quickly fall behind. The Trump administration would be wise to rethink its stance on immigration. Otherwise making America great again will become another broken campaign promise.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
The Uninsured Rate Is Worsening After Years Of Obamacare's Gains,"The uninsured rate is creeping back up. After several years of dramatic declines in the percentage of Americans who lack health insurance ― a direct result of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage provisions ― the trend is beginning to reverse, according to new data the polling firm Gallup and digital health company Sharecare published Wednesday. The share of Americans without health insurance rose to 12.2 percent last year, up from 10.9 percent at the end of 2016. The 2016 figure was the lowest Gallup recorded since tracking the uninsured rate in 2008. The low uninsured rate two years ago represented a decline of nearly 7 percentage points from 2013, the year before the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion and subsidies for private health insurance came online and the year with the highest rate in Gallup’s polling history. What’s more, the uninsured rate increased in 17 states last year, and it was the first year since 2014 that at least one state didn’t experience a decline in those without health insurance, Gallup and Sharecare report.  Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico and West Virginia saw the largest increases. Massachusetts’ 4 percent uninsured rate was the nation’s lowest, and the highest was in Texas at 22.1 percent, according to the findings of telephone surveys conducted throughout 2017. It’s unusual for the uninsured rate to grow during a period of low and falling unemployment because jobs are the most common source of health coverage.  But much higher premiums for those who buy insurance on their own, President Donald Trump’s actions to weaken the Affordable Care Act’s insurance marketplaces and other factors have begun to undo the gains seen earlier this decade. In other words, Trump’s sabotage of the Affordable Care Act appears to be working. There’s reason to believe this trend will continue this year and into the future.  The Trump administration has begun approving states’ requests to impose work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid enrollees, which is expected to  cause an unknown number of low-income people to lose coverage.  In addition, Trump and Congress’ repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate that most people obtain health coverage or face tax penalties takes effect next year. Premium hikes on the health insurance exchanges are expected to be significant next year, as indicated by early rate requests from insurers in Virginia and Maryland.  The Gallup-Sharecare survey is the second this month showing a rise in the number of people without health coverage. According to a Commonwealth Fund report published last week, the share of adults ages 18 to 64 who are uninsured is 15.5 percent, up from 12.7 percent at end of 2016, which the think tank calculates amounts to 4 million fewer people with coverage. The Commonwealth Fund’s numbers are higher than the Gallup-Sharecare data largely because they exclude the elderly and children. Nearly all Americans 65 and over are covered by Medicare, and the uninsured rate for children is less than 5 percent, in part because Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program provide coverage for low- and middle-income kids. Gallup and Sharecare’s data don’t explain who is losing coverage or why. But several factors last year made coverage harder to afford. The health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act have struggled since their debut in 2014, and last year was no different.  Premiums for those who don’t qualify for subsidies rose by double digits ― and sometimes much higher ― in 2017, presenting major affordability challenges for people who must pay full price for their health insurance because they earn too much to qualify for government subsidies. That continued this year and will happen again next year.  Part of that is the ongoing trouble insurers on the exchange have experienced attracting enough low-cost healthy people whose premiums offset the expense of people who need high-priced medical care. But Trump took a number of steps that exacerbated these problems. Chief among them was a decision to cut off billions of dollars in payments the federal government owes health insurance companies that serve the lowest-income exchange customers. Insurers responded with rate increases far above what they otherwise would have imposed.  Exchange enrollment fell in 2017 compared with the prior year, and it declined again this year. During the open enrollment period for 2017 ― which began in the fall of 2016 under President Barack Obama and ended in 2017 during the early weeks of the current administration ― Trump officials halted advertising designed to encourage people to sign up for coverage. During the 2018 open enrollment period, the administration went much further, by decimating the advertising and outreach budget, forbidding federal officials from participating in local sign-up efforts and even mounting a campaign against the Affordable Care Act using funds intended to promote enrollment. The uninsured rate is likely to increase further this year and next.  It is doubtful that the administration will reverse course and begin putting greater resources toward helping people enroll on the exchanges, based on its conduct in the previous two sign-up periods.  The mandate repeal eliminates one reason to buy coverage, especially for those who believe they need it the least. Moreover, the administration is relaxing regulations on forms of health insurance that are more attractive to the healthy, and less attractive to those who need care, that could cherry-pick the most profitable customers from the exchanges, leading to further premium increases for those who remain in that segment of the market. Insurers cite these factors as reasons for their proposed rate hikes next year.  And restrictive Medicaid policies that the administration champions will increase uninsurance among the low-income population.",POLITICS,BUSINESS

UCLA Players Arrested In China Arrive Home After Trump Talks To Xi Jinping,"Three UCLA basketball players detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting arrived back in the United States on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he had sought the help of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the case. The players landed at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Shanghai on Tuesday evening, their heads down. The three ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― declined to speak to throngs of reporters before boarding a bus. “What they did was unfortunate,” Trump told reporters earlier in Manila. He said the trio, who had been held since last week, could have faced long prison sentences. Trump described Xi’s response as “terrific.” Trump had raised the issue with Xi at a dinner held during the U.S. leader’s Nov. 8-10 state visit to Beijing. “The relevant case involving three students has already been resolved according to law,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said without elaborating when asked at a regular briefing in Beijing about Trump’s discussion of the issue with Xi. The three basketball players were detained by police on Nov. 7 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou over allegations of shoplifting. They were not on the team’s return flight to the United States on Saturday. A senior White House official said the players had been given relatively light treatment due to Trump’s intervention. “It’s in large part because the president brought it up,” the official told Reuters. The UCLA team had been in China for a game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Saturday, which UCLA won 63-60. The teams had traveled to Hangzhou earlier in the week to visit the headquarters of the game’s sponsor, Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The three students, all freshmen, were taken in for questioning by police about alleged shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store. They were released from police custody early on Wednesday and had been confined to a luxury hotel pending legal proceedings. Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, who had not spoken with the three players, said what had occurred was a “very regrettable situation.” The Pac-12 is the college athletic conference in which UCLA participates. “I’m just glad it’s resolved and that they’re on the way home safely,” he told Reuters by telephone. Since the matter did not occur on the court, it would be up to UCLA whether the players will be punished, Scott said. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement that the university’s Athletics and Office of Student Conduct would review the incident and determine any potential discipline. He said such proceedings would be confidential. “I want to be clear that we take seriously any violations of the law,” he said.",SPORTS,SPORTS
There's A Cheap And Effective Way To Reduce Gun Violence. Why Aren't More States Doing It?,"Maryland enacted a wide-reaching package of gun violence prevention laws last week, becoming one of just a handful of states to get behind little-known measures that could save hundreds of lives and millions of dollars. The measure, the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2018, was designed to address urban violence, an issue that gets relatively little attention in the U.S. gun debate — it’s the mass shootings like Newtown, Las Vegas and Parkland that make the headlines — despite accounting for most of the 13,000 firearm homicides and 60,000 nonfatal shootings that take place across the nation each year.  The bill sets aside $5 million in the coming year to fund grants for programs that have been effective at making violence-stricken neighborhoods more peaceful. Maryland is now one of just six states funding gun violence prevention and intervention programs. California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York have been making modest investments for a number of years, and data suggest it has paid off in target cities, with substantial declines in shootings and violent crime, according to a recent report by the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a national nonprofit founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). The sponsor of the Maryland legislation, Democratic Delegate Brooke Lierman, said she felt compelled to act amid a murder epidemic in Baltimore, which saw more than 1,000 homicides from 2015 to 2017. “What’s happening in Baltimore is a tragedy, as is what’s happening in other areas of the country where we are seeing homicide after homicide, death after death, day in and day out,” she told HuffPost. “Every dollar that we spend to prevent those deaths is definitely a dollar worth spending.” Baltimore has already seen success with a prevention model called Cure Violence, a public health strategy that addresses the causes of violence. Case workers provide street outreach to those at risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence and mediate conflicts before they boil over. Neighborhoods that have adopted the program have seen far fewer shootings, with some recording periods of more than a year without a homicide, Lierman said. Anti-violence advocates say contributing to these programs makes financial sense. Gun violence costs the U.S. an estimated $229 billion each year, according to a 2012 study that measured direct spending on law enforcement, criminal justice and health care as well as indirect costs like lost wages and the effects of shootings on victims’ quality of life. Taxpayers often end up picking up a substantial portion of the tab for this violence. Many shooting victims don’t have private health insurance, and it’s expensive to prosecute and imprison perpetrators. Previous studies have calculated that taxpayers shoulder an average of $464,000 in costs for each gun homicide and as much as $40,000 for each nonfatal shooting. In Maryland, gun violence costs taxpayers approximately $294 million every year, according to an estimate by Giffords based on those studies. Supporters of this type of state-level initiative recognize that the problem of daily gun violence tends to be confined to cities, often to specific neighborhoods. But for people outside those areas, ignoring the issue comes at a cost too. “Even if you live in a suburban neighborhood where gun violence isn’t affecting you day to day, you are directly paying for the gun violence in nearby cities,” said Mike McLively, the director of the Urban Gun Violence Initiative at Giffords. “If you can’t get on board for moral reasons, you should at least be able to get on board for economic reasons.” But the fact that there has been so little support for and attention paid to prevention programs reveals a lot about the gun debate. Urban communities, particularly communities of color, face a shockingly disproportionate share of gun violence in the U.S. Of the 13,000 victims of gun homicides in 2015, over 8,500 were men of color, according to the Giffords report. Black men account for nearly half of firearm homicide victims each year but make up only 6 percent of the population. This phenomenon, known as murder inequality, is one of the many racial disparities that plague urban neighborhoods in the form of poverty, lack of employment opportunity and disinvestment in education and social services. Despite those figures, the mass shootings in affluent, predominantly white communities like Newtown, Connecticut, and Parkland, Florida, most frequently drive the conversation as well as the ensuing policy agenda on gun violence. With those isolated tragedies in mind, it makes sense that some people support tightening gun laws and restricting access to certain weapons as a response. In communities like Newtown, where there hasn’t been a murder since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, according to federal data, and Parkland, which hadn’t seen a gun homicide for at least a decade before the February shooting, a mass shooting may be residents’ only experience with gun violence. There is disagreement over how effective certain popular gun control proposals would be at preventing mass shootings. But it seems unlikely that a measure like banning bump stocks would do much to stem the routine bloodshed in cities, where most lives are being lost. This doesn’t mean state lawmakers shouldn’t continue to advocate for stronger gun laws as part of a comprehensive approach to preventing violence, said Lierman, who supported the complete package of firearms legislation in Maryland. But in states where gun politics is more contentious, she said, a plan like hers could give legislators a way to make a dent in violence without having to wade into a debate about gun control. “It has absolutely nothing to do with taking away guns, and it should be exactly the kind of initiative that everybody, including gun enthusiasts, can support,” she said. “It is all about creating programs to stop gun violence.” At a committee hearing for Lierman’s bill in February, pro-gun-rights lobbyists found reasons to oppose the effort. The NRA would be “more comfortable if there were language included that recognizes the individual right to keep and bear arms,” a representative for the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action said during testimony. She said the organization couldn’t commit to supporting the bill even if it were amended in that manner. John Jocelyn of the NRA-affiliated Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore criticized the legislation for placing too much focus on the issue of violence with firearms and not enough on issues like “rebuilding families.” “The program in itself can’t succeed unless we address the foundation issues to begin with,” he said. He went on to encourage lawmakers to reintroduce the bill in a future session, when they could “address the entire massive problem we face.” They were the lone opposing voices. “I was disappointed but not surprised,” said Lierman. “The NRA has apparently decided it needs to oppose anything that has to do with decreasing gun violence.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
"In Los Angeles, Bitter Tensions Over Where To House The Homeless Rile Communities","LOS ANGELES — Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown. “Why in Boyle Heights?” he asked. “I dare you to go try and build this in Beverly Hills. It would never get through.”  El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center.  Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question.  Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents’ vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They’ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado’s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency. Rosado says Lorena Street isn’t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby.  “To put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks?” Rosado said. “I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.” The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city’s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted. Housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters. In an open letter to Huizar during the appeal meetings, L.A.’s top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal “would deny Los Angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported.” “We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness,” said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is “that people are on the fence about how we’re going to do that.” This concern isn’t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice ― a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts ― have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless.  Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals. “Five is too many,” reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights. Still, Rosado thinks his situation in Boyle Heights is different from other conflicts around the city. Residents here feel their voices have been ignored, and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development. A Community of Friends, the nonprofit developer seeking to build Lorena Plaza, seems surprised by the backlash. In the past 30 years, ACOF has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy. “The word I would use to describe us was ‘stealth,’” said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF’s director. “We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we’ve never done it before. That’s not quite true.” Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult. Gallo believes the Rosados’ environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados’ initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was “very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk.”  Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District ― which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger ― was trickling into the barrio. Rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of Boyle Heights, and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this. “They would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls,” he said. “They would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through.” He suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city, “where it’s not the white-collar people that are affected or the blue-collar.” On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said “Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER,” packed the aisles of City Hall’s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present. The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment. ACOF’s Gallo also addressed the council, telling them her organization has “remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location, and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in Los Angeles can successfully negotiate a solution.” Huizar, the councilmember, raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal.  “It’s not an issue of NIMBYism or against permanent supportive housing. It’s an issue about community process, building trust, no matter what you’re building ― whether it’s a retail center, permanent supportive housing, commercial,” he said. “Whatever it is, there needs to be trust between the applicant, the developer and the local community, and that’s what was lacking here.” Yet Huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow ACOF to build Lorena Plaza. Then the council cast its vote: thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward, and zero opposed.  Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar’s about-face. “It’s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it’s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that,” she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020. Tony Rosado said he is “disappointed,” but isn’t backing down yet. “We’re going to continue fighting it,” he said. “We’re going to pursue our legal options.”  In a statement to HuffPost, Huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review, and will ensure the soil is clean. He also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.  “As we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the City, we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes,” he said. “That doesn’t mean everyone will be happy with every project, but unlike this process, at least we’ll all be clear about what is being proposed.” On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado’s lawyers, asks for the city’s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review. It also asks for the suspension of the “authority of City and City Council... to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project” until a full review is conducted.

Black Athletes Don't Work On A Plantation,"Donald Trump’s demand while addressing an adoring crowd of white folks in Huntsville, Alabama that the rich, white, largely Republican owners of National Football League teams fire the “son of a bitch” among players who engage in symbolic protest has begun a fight he cannot win. First, by using the term “son of a bitch” to describe the protesters who are trying to bring light to the current racial injustices in American society, Trump insulted the mothers of African-American athletes, thereby crossing a line that few people are foolish enough to do. “Guess that makes me a proud bitch!” tweeted Teresa Kaepernick, the mother of Colin Kaepernick. What followed was an outpouring of solidarity and protest from athletes, including two of the greatest basketball players in history, LeBron James and Steph Curry, as well as coaches, managers and fans from coast to coast and even in London. (The growing racial awareness in professional sports today is reminiscent of the era of Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos.) Prior to Sunday’s NFL games, the Seattle Seahawks’ players released a statement that sums up the sentiments of players throughout the league: Second, Trump chose to enunciate his “son of a bitch” barbs aimed at black athletes in Alabama – the state with a checkered racial history to say the least. From the Tuskegee syphilis experiments in Macon County, to the Scottsboro Boys, to the Montgomery bus boycott, to the 50 unsolved terror bombings targeting black people in Birmingham from 1947-1965, to the vicious attacks on Reverend Fred Shuttleworth’s church, to the dogs and fire hoses, to “Bull” Connor and Governor George Wallace “standing in the schoolhouse door,” to the murder of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Alabama has been the location of some of the worst racial violence in American history. Trump’s message in Alabama was clear: You black athletes work on our plantations, so don’t get uppity. What followed from Trump after he sparked such a widespread backlash was the typical “punch, parry, kick” playbook Republicans use when they interject racism into the political discourse for electoral gain as Ian Haney Lopez presents in Dog Whistle Politics, an important book about how right-wingers use race as a cudgel to beat up their opponents. First Trump “punched” racism into the dialogue with his “son of a bitch” statement before an adoring crowd of white Republicans in Alabama. Then he “parried” for the reporters saying that his words had “nothing to do with race.” What we’ll see next is the “kick” when Trump and his surrogates like Laura Ingraham, Breitbart, Drudge and Fox News denounce the African-American athletes for being the ones responsible for interjecting race in politics. It’s a classic tactic that people like Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh have perfected over the years. What Trump needs to learn is that there are no professional sports in this country without African-American athletes. Colin Kaepernick, who grew up in northern California and is clearly cognizant of the activism of black athletes who came before him (such as Tommy Smith and John Carlos, who were San Jose State students) as well as the power of high profile athletes to bring attention to racial injustice has started something big. If Trump continues down this racist path through the rest of the football season the black NFL players should contemplate a direct action this February at the Super Bowl – that unparalleled orgy of advertising dollars and unbridled consumer capitalism unique to the United States – and SHUT IT DOWN!",SPORTS,SPORTS
Protests Erupt As University Looks To Hire Coach Connected To Sandusky Abuse Case,"Students, parents and politicians were dismayed on Sunday at reports that the University of Tennessee may hire a coach accused of witnessing former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky abusing a child. Several outlets, including ESPN, reported Sunday that the university was in talks to bring on Greg Schiano as its head football coach, sparking widespread outrage among the Tennessee Volunteers fanbase. Schiano peers accused him of witnessing Jerry Sandusky molestation of minors at Penn State University, based on court documents released last year. Schiano was an assistant coach at the school when he allegedly saw Sandusky acting inappropriately with a boy in the showers. And now many parents, students, and social media users have accused Schiano of covering up the incident. Former Penn State assistant Mike McQueary testified that Schiano was aware of the molestation, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post in 2016. McQueary told the courts that another assistant coach, Tom Bradley, identified Schiano as a witness to Sandusky’s molestation.  “No, only that he had — I can’t remember if it was one night or one morning — but that Greg had come into [Bradley’s] office white as a ghost and said he just saw Jerry doing something to a boy in the shower,” McQueary testified.  Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over the course of 15 years.  Schiano has denied the allegations that he had knowledge of Sandusky’s crimes. The coach has worked at Rutgers University, Ohio State University, and in the National Football League in the years since leaving Penn State. The University of Tennessee athletics department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.  Tennessee Volunteers fans took to social media, expressing anger about the potential hire and students assembled on campus with signs to protest.  Our Tennessee standards mean something, and a Greg Schiano hire would be anathema to all that our University and our community stand for. I sincerely hope that these rumors are not true, because even serious consideration would be unacceptable. Tennessee #Vols on every level - parents of current players, former players, current coaches, former coaches - and coaches from other programs - universally against Schiano. Never seen anything like it. This is Trip Underwood. He painted the Rock. He's says it's ""A bigger thing than football, it comes down to morals in general."" pic.twitter.com/LZJzkM7Hzl Vol fans- you and I are very much alike. VFL to the day we die. Tennessee has the best fans on the planet. But I am not able to support Greg Schiano as our head football coach. John Currie, if this really is your decision, I have zero respect for you. That’s all I got. Starting to see some signs now. Fans are telling me they're upset with Schiano's past and alleged ties to the Penn State scandal. pic.twitter.com/2azdGMqB0H Schiano is clearly the wrong choice. I hope @John_Currie & @ChancellorDav choose someone else. #KeepLooking Hey @John_Currie if you are hiring Greg Schiano do us all a favor and resign at the press conference. Absolute disgrace. Please read my statement on the potential hiring of Greg Schiano as the next University of Tennessee head football coach. pic.twitter.com/lvanBDFOhn",SPORTS,SPORTS
People Across The U.S. Watch 'Surreal' Solar Eclipse,"DENVER ― People across North America finally got to view the highly anticipated total solar eclipse on Monday.  The event, described by one scientist as “the most spectacular thing that anybody has ever seen,” began crossing 14 states on a path from /www.eclipse2017.org/2017/path_through_the_US.htm""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">Oregon to South Carolina on Monday morning. Along that “path of totality,” viewers have been able to view the moon completely covering the sun. Observers outside the path of totality have been able to see a partial solar eclipse, protecting their eyes with highly sought-after special glasses.  In the Sloan’s Lake neighborhood of Denver, people gathered under a cloudless blue sky to watch the moon slowly obstruct the sun, eventually blocking just above 92 percent of it.  Jordan Van Wyck, 30, called the spectacle “surreal.” He and his friends wondered what solar eclipses might look like on a planet with multiple moons. This is the first total eclipse viewable from the lower 48 states since February 1979. It will be the first total solar eclipse in 99 years to sweep from coast to coast. Viewing events were held across the country, including at the White House where President Donald Trump stood on the Truman Balcony. “Don’t look!” a voice from the crowd bellowed as Trump briefly looked up at the partial eclipse without protective glasses. In Washington, D.C., the moon covered about 81 percent of the sun in the afternoon.  During totality ― the few minutes when the moon completely obscures the sun ― the sky fades to black. A video shared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday shows what that wave of darkness looks like from space: Watch the moon's shadow move across the US in this geocolor loop from #GOES16!

Sweet Dogs Dumped at the Shelter Almost Run Out of Time,"Maisy and Bear have always been together even when they were dumped off at the shelter. Bear has been like a big brother for Maisy, looking out for her. Maisy and Bear spent most of their life severely neglected. They were most likely tied up and left out in the backyard alone. They were never taught how to walk properly on leashes, taken to the vet or fully socialized. Unfortunately for Maisy and Bear, their time was running out at the shelter.  Maisy and Bear spent months at the shelter waiting to be adopted. Maisy was actually adopted three separate times and taken home. Once the adopters got Maisy home, they realized she had an issue with her leg from an old injury that her previous owners neglected. She had never been to the vet. It was heartbreaking to see Maisy returned to the shelter all three times because of her injury. Back at the shelter, Maisy was always greeted by her ol' friend Bear, but was still in pain and without a home.   Like many Pitty mixes, Bear was never adopted, and soon the shelter no longer had the space for two larger, less adoptable dogs. It seemed that they were waiting for a day that would never come. Maisy and Bear were scheduled to the euthanized.   Helen, Founder of Creature Kind Foundation noticed Maisy and Bear and called the shelter begging them to hold onto them so that she could come down to the shelter and pull them and foster them. She raced to the shelter to bring them home and saved them from euthanasia. A week later, Maisy had surgery for her leg injury and made a full recovery. An animal behavioral specialist has been working with Bear and Maisy on their leash walking and socialization.   Now Maisy and Bear have improved greatly, and their personalities are shining through. They get to experience car rides, long walks and love like they have never had before. Most importantly, Maisy and Bear are still together and won't ever have to wait for a home in a shelter again. Creature Kind Foundation recognized what amazing dogs Maisy and Bear were, and decided they were worth saving. Best of all, foster mom Helen has decided to adopt Maisy and Bear so that they can be together forever! What a wonderful ending to the story!

"Kim Jong Un Look-Alike Gets Booted From Olympics, Says Face Is 'Too Political'","A dead ringer for North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un caused mischief during a historic ice hockey game at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday. As the unified Korean women’s team took to the ice for its game against Japan, a man who identified himself only as Howard walked in front of the North Korean cheer squad and waved at the crowd. He also waved what appeared to be a flag depicting a unified Korean peninsula. South Korean counter-terrorism officials escorted him away to a nearby seat, reports Reuters. Vincent Bevins, a correspondent who writes for The Washington Post, shared footage of the incident to Twitter. At the united Korea vs Japan womens' hockey game, an apparent Kim Jong-un impersonator starts dancing in front of North Korean cheerleaders. Apparent employees of the DPRK push him aside. He's now sitting nearby giving interviews (in English) pic.twitter.com/PeVJYtri5Y According to Bevins, who was on the scene, local police then took Howard to a nearby hallway where he protested his innocence. “I just want to see the game, so what’s the problem?” he’s heard asking in another video that Bevins shared below. Police have now surrounded and asked the apparent impersonator to come with him, he says his name's Howard, was just cheering and looks like this, and didn't commit any crime. Refuses to go with them. South Korea police apparently unsure what to do pic.twitter.com/pGzvV0ufcq Officials then took Howard into a nearby office for questioning. They've now taken him into a room in the hallway and closed the door. pic.twitter.com/x2MT4MAVAj He was released a short period later and was reportedly “politely asked” to leave the ice hockey stadium: Seems he was released.

Idaho Inches Closer To Electing The Nation's First Native American Governor,"WASHINGTON ― Progressive Democrat Paulette Jordan won Tuesday night’s primary in the Idaho governor’s race, setting her up for a tough November election but with a shot at becoming the nation’s first Native American governor. Jordan, a two-term state legislator, defeated multimillionaire and Boise school board member A.J. Balukoff. She won more than 58 percent of the vote, despite being significantly outspent and up against her party’s establishment. Jordan will now face Lt. Gov. Brad Little in November. He won Tuesday night’s GOP primary with 37 percent of the vote. He defeated U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador and real estate developer Tommy Ahlquist. It is a long-shot bid for Jordan, 38. She’s running as a pro-LGBTQ rights, pro-marijuana legalization, pro-Medicaid expansion Democrat in a deeply red state. The last time Idaho elected a Democratic governor was in 1990. Little, 64, has been lieutenant governor since 2009 and is the heir apparent to Gov. Butch Otter (R), who decided not to run for another term. He is anti-abortion, opposes same-sex marriage and is not a fan of expanding Medicaid, though he said he would not repeal a Medicaid expansion initiative on the November ballot if it is passed by voters. Jordan does have some advantages, namely that her candidacy is just plain exciting. She is a young woman of color running for a seat that a woman has never held in Idaho. An enrolled member of the Coeur d’Alene tribe, she would make history as the country’s first Native American governor. And her campaign comes at a time when Democrats are energized and flooding the polls nationwide in response to Donald Trump’s presidency. Democratic turnout was off the charts in Tuesday’s elections. Precincts in and around Boise, a major hub of Democratic voters, actually ran out of ballots at one point. Statewide, Democratic turnout was more than double what it had been in the 2014 primary. That year, about 25,000 Democrats voted for a gubernatorial candidate. This time, more than 65,000 did. Republican turnout was up in Idaho too, but not by as much as Democratic turnout. More than 155,000 Republicans voted for a gubernatorial candidate in 2014. This year, more than 191,000 did. Jordan, who has deep roots in Idaho’s ranching culture, has some appeal among independents. A March poll by Idaho Politics Weekly found that 19 percent of independents said they liked Jordan best. That’s compared to 13 percent of independents saying they preferred Ahlquist and 12 percent saying they liked Labrador. Nine percent of independents said they preferred Little. The same poll showed no clear front-runner in the general election. Among all voters, Jordan polled at 15 percent. Labrador and Ahlquist polled at 16 and 15 percent, respectively. Little polled at 11 percent.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Hubble Captures Breathtaking Portrait Of Blue Bubble In Space,"There's no bursting this bubble. The folks at the Hubble Space Telescope have released magnificent images of a ""gigantic cosmic soap bubble"" to celebrate Hubble's 26th anniversary in space. Named the Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, this interstellar cloud of gas and dust was first discovered in 1787, but the object is so big that previously it could only be photographed in sections. The new image (seen above) is a mosaic of four images taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. On April 24, 1990, the space shuttle Discovery lifted off from Earth along with the Hubble Space Telescope. Each year, Hubble releases a new spectacular image to commemorate the anniversary of its launch. The star at the center of the nebula, which gives off a glowing effect, is between ten and twenty times the mass of the Sun. The nebula’s bubble-like form is a result of strong stellar winds pushing gas and dust into a spherical shape. To show how far the technology has progressed, NASA/ESA resurfaced an image from 1998 showing the Bubble Nebula.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
A Comprehensive List Of Everything Don Jr. Doesn't Know About That Infamous Meeting,"The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released more than 2,500 pages of documents from its inquiry into the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016.

Trump Terrible 10: Tax Scam Edition,"""There is no justice, the rich win, the poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing people lie."" -- ""The Verdict"" (1982), screenplay by David Mamet I'm still not surprised by Donald Trump's disgraceful performance in office. By the time he was elected it was clear how dishonest, corrupt, bigoted, incompetent, and just plain vile he is. What is dismaying is how many Republicans -- in Congress, in his administration, and across the country -- are willing to tolerate this sick behavior to get what they want. They should be treating Trump like a sad, irrelevant Humpty Dumpty egg on a throne, and work with the Democrats to address the challenges facing middle-class, working Americans. But they don't care about any of that. Now the Senate has passed a disgraceful tax bill, with 51 of 52 GOP senators voting yes. The bill not only validates the presidency of an unfit, malevolent should-not-be-president; it also transfers billions from the middle class to the ultra-rich, meaning Donald Trump himself, and the biggest Republican donors. This was, in many ways, the worst moment so far in an ugly year for America. So who's responsible? Glad you asked, because: Since 2017, Republic Report's “Trump Terrible 10” has ranked the week’s 10 most disgraceful figures in Trump world. Republic Report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of President Donald J. Trump. Trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with disrespect for constitutional values, know-nothing ignorance, serious bigotry, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy. Permanent spoiler alert: We can’t imagine anyone other than Donald Trump, Sr., ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. But we won’t get tired of him winning. Believe me. 10. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), chair, Senate Finance Committee. Last week’s ranking: ― Hatch whined and complained every time Senate Democrats tried to bring the truth into his committee's tax bill debate. Most things he says of substance are first whispered, loud enough for us all to hear, by an aide into Hatch's ear. She apparently wasn't around to whisper when Hatch this week told MSNBC that, as presidents go, Trump is “one of the best I’ve served under.” 9. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury. Last week’s ranking: ― Mnuchin kept claiming that his Treasury Department was preparing for release a full analysis of the tax bill. But that didn't happen, and Senator Elizabeth Warren rightly asked Treasury’s inspector general to investigate whether the Secretary acted improperly. I'm sure Mnuchin, worth hundreds of millions himself, and tax-conscious wife Louise won't care what the IG says, because they're gonna make millions more from this deal. 8. Susan Collins, United States Senator (R-ME). Last week’s ranking ― Next election, Collins will likely get many of the votes of the billionaires in Maine. No one else should vote for her. 7. Apple, Google, Facebook, Uber, and other tech giants. Last week’s ranking: ― The big tech companies want us to believe they're cool, and that they're kinda on our side against Trump. But they lobbied hard to pass a Republican tax bill that gives them numerous ways to get more money, while their customers, and people who can't afford their services, will pay more money. 6. General Michael Flynn (US Army-Retired), former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Last week’s ranking: ― Decent folk may now see Flynn as our potential new best friend - yay. But Flynn has now admitted that while serving as the president's national security advisor, he lied to FBI agents. And he's done a lot of other dishonest, corrupt things in the past few years. Luckily the people he may be informing on to Robert Mueller are just as disgraceful. 5. John McCain, United States Senator (R-AZ). Last week’s ranking: ― Sometimes it looks like McCain is a man of great integrity. But given all the times he's voted for dishonest, predatory special interests, it seems more likely that what motivates him sometimes to take a bold stand is just spite. He's not a saint; he's a troll. 4. Charles and David Koch, billionaires. Last week’s ranking: ― They are getting almost everything they want from the Trump administration -- huge tax breaks, greater leeway to pollute and overheat the planet. Which isn't surprising, because administration heavyweights like Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Don McGahn, Marc Short, and Scott Pruitt have long been their paid stooges. Worse, the Kochs have helped fund the ugly Project Veritas sting/deceptive editing operation. 3. Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States. Last week’s ranking: 9 Robert Mueller already has the evidence -- it's right in front of our eyes -- to nail Trump for obstruction of justice, and he may be closing in on collusion with Russia as well. That's good. But if that happens, we may be stuck with this Koch stooge / religious fundamentalist / regular liar as president for quite a while. Awesome. 2. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, and Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House. Last week’s ranking: 4 McConnell and Ryan know Trump is disgusting, but they're getting psyched about standing by his side as the most disgraceful tax bill ever written becomes law. The pair are living monuments to Washington as a corrupt swamp; the men who make the GOP -- and thus our federal government in 2017 -- a purely pay-to-play operation, where rich individual and corporate donors can buy whatever policy they want in exchange for campaign donations and the promise of future revolving door jobs. Bonus points for circulating a supposed economists' letter -- later highlighted on Twitter by Trump -- endorsing the tax bill; the letter's signers included a possibly nonexistent person, a non-economist office assistant, and a convicted forger. 1. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Last week’s ranking: Are you serious? Our tax victor president is a vile piece of garbage.  You already know the details from this lowest of weeks. Instead of honoring the World War II Navajo Code Talkers, Trump insulted them with a painting of Indian Killer Andrew Jackson and a slur employed to randomly attack Senator Warren. Trump reportedly is now telling people that the Access Hollywood tape, for which he directly apologized last year, may be fake, and that the Obama birth hoax, which he disgracefully perpetrated before recanting, may again be real. He also reportedly has pressured senators to drop the Russia probe. Trump poison tweeted in advance of his government shutdown meeting with Chuck and Nancy, thus killing the meeting. Maybe, as has been hinted, Trump did it on purpose because he likes the idea of a shutdown. Or maybe it's more proof that he just doesn't understand the, um, art of the deal. Trump sent avowed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-hater Mick Mulvaney down the street to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Trump tweet-attacked CNN International as fake, imperiling the safety of journalists and of people whose struggles are highlighted by CNN global reporting. Trump retweeted sketchy anti-Muslim videos distributed by a racist, xenophobic U.K. group. He ratcheted up support for the bigoted accused child molester Roy Moore, while weighing in like a gossip blog on the scandals of others. His insane bluster regarding North Korea has totally backfired. And Trump falsely told an audience in Missouri that the tax bill ""is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me."" We all learned long ago that while nearly everything Trump says is a lie, you can be sure it's a lie when he adds his signature assurance, ""believe me."" Trump is again number one — the most disgraceful figure in the Trump administration. Trump is not merely a disgrace; he’s a total and complete disgrace.

Investors Urge Apple To Tackle ‘Growing’ Evidence Of Device Addiction In Kids,"Two major Apple shareholders are calling on the company to do more to protect children from the potentially harmful side effects of excessive technology use. In a letter delivered to Apple on Saturday, representatives from the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the investment firm Jana Partners LLC urged the tech giant to address the “growing body of evidence” that suggests frequent digital-device use can have “unintentional negative consequences” for children and teens. “We’re not software engineers, and we don’t pretend to be,” Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told HuffPost. “And we’re not doctors and we don’t pretend to be. What we’re saying is, hey, software engineers, hey doctors, get together and form a real effort to understand this issue better and go where the research takes you.”  Letter From JANA Partners and CalSTRS to Apple Inc. Board by Hayley Miller on Scribd In their letter, representatives of the two investors  ― which collectively control roughly $2 billion worth of Apple shares ― cite several recent studies conducted by universities, medical centers and mental health advocacy groups. Those findings suggest that children who often use smartphones or other digital devices are more likely to be distracted at school, develop depression and sleep less. “It would defy common sense to argue that this level of usage, by children whose brains are still developing, is not having at least some impact,” the letter reads, “or that the maker of such a powerful product has no role to play in helping parents to ensure it is being used optimally.” Dr. Michael Rich, founder and director of Harvard University’s Center on Media and Child Health, partnered with the investors to help them craft their call to action. Smartphones and other digital devices are “dramatically changing the way we behave, the way we relate to each other and the way our society really works,” Rich told HuffPost.  Apple “can be part of the solution and thus improve their product, and thus improve their customer satisfaction and loyalty,” he said. “There’s more than profits at stake here. There’s actual social change.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. The shareholders outlined five steps Apple could take to address their concerns, such as developing new parental controls that would allow for more variations of restricted use, and creating an expert committee of childhood development specialists to help study the issue. “It’s not the tools themselves that are the problem ― it is actually what we do with them,” Rich said. “You wouldn’t give a power saw to an infant or a toddler, but you would introduce it to a child who is old enough to handle it effectively and do good things with it.” Penner said the vast majority of reactions to the letter have been favorable. Jim Steyer, chief executive officer of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that promotes safe technology use for children, called the letter a “hugely important development” in curbing “digital addiction.” A handful of tech leaders have recently spoken out against the potential negative effects of social media and device usage on children. Last year, two former Facebook executives separately argued that the social network is harmful to society. “It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,” Sean Parker, Facebook’s founding president, said in an interview with Axios in November. “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Penner says it’s time for tech companies to evolve with the research. “The days of just kind of coming up with technology and throwing it out there,” he said, “and 10 years later, seeing what the potentially unintended consequences are, should be over.”",TECH,TECH
"Record Cold Digs Into Invasive Insect Population, But Won't Lead To Total Wipeout","From AccuWeather's Mark Leberfinger: The brutally cold winter of 2013-14 has put a dent in the invasive insect population, but it won't be a total wipeout, according to experts. The severe cold that certain areas of the United States experienced this January will undoubtedly impact certain organisms, especially those that are not well adapted to survive cold winters, Thomas P. Kuhar, an entomology professor at Virginia Tech University, said. ""These include some warmer-climate species that have moved into more northerly climates over the past decades of warmer years,"" Kuhar said. ""They also include species that are not well protected from the cold, such as insects spending the winter in leaf litter for instance."" Cold weather will continue into April but will not be as cold as experienced earlier this winter, AccuWeather.com Long-Range Expert Jack Boston said. ""Basically, the cold spell that we're coming out of is likely going to be the coldest one, but that doesn't mean we won't have another cold spell,"" Boston said. The brown marmorated stink bug, however, is well-adapted to colder climates, Kuhar said.  The bugs have been detected in 40 states, causing severe agricultural problems in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia. The stink bugs will mass together and seek shelter in late September. They will huddle together in buildings, cracks of giant rock outcroppings or inside dead standing trees. ""Both of these behaviors enable this bug to escape much of the severity from the wind-chill elements,"" Kuhar said. The stink bugs also change during the winter by increasing their concentration of cryoprotectants such as polyalcohols, sugars and sometimes proteins. ""This acts as kind of an antifreeze preventing crystallization of the hemolymph or insect blood, if you will,"" Kuhar said. Overwintering stink bugs can endure temperatures as low as 4 or 5 F (-15 C) before crystallization and likely death occurs, he said. The biggest threat to stink bugs and many other living things in temperate regions is a premature warm spell during the winter, causing activity of the bugs and movement out of shelters, then a severe drop in temperature soon after, Kuhar said. ""Warm temperatures during winter, or inside of a house for instance, induce the bug to move, which burns up energy reserves leading to likely death from desiccation or depleted fat (energy) reserves,"" he said. Stink bugs that survive this winter won't adapt to the point of a ""superbug,"" because they have evolved over centuries in Asia and has been exposed to a greater range of temperature extremes, Kuhar said. On the other hand, the mosquitoes responsible for the spread of West Nile Virus are hardier and are expected to continue as a major presence during 2014 in Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protect. ""Unfortunately, this breed [Northern House mosquito] successfully hibernates as adults, regardless of how cold the temperatures may plunge during the winter,"" DEP Spokeswoman Amanda Witman said. ""When they emerge in the spring, they are quick to reproduce, so the severity of the winter weather has very little to no impact on them."" However, there is some positive news on the mosquito front, Witman said.  The population of Asian Tiger mosquitoes has grown during the last several years, but they overwinter in the egg stage, making them a little more vulnerable in extreme cold. ""When the average mean temperature dips below 23 degrees, a large die-off of Asian Tiger mosquitoes is expected,"" Witman said. ""Again, this breed does not carry West Nile virus, but they are a major nuisance as they are out during the daytime, not just dawn and dusk as is typical for other breeds of mosquito."" The average mean temperature in a good part of Pennsylvania late next week could be before the 23 F mean, Boston said. After mid-March, there could be as many as four milder days above normal. A storm is possible next week in the East, maybe a snowstorm in the interior of the region, Boston said. After that storm, there will be another blast of cold air but not as cold as earlier this winter.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Bumble Bans Gun Photos From Members' Profiles,"In the wake of the Parkland school shooting that left 17 people dead, Bumble announced it will no longer allow members to post any photos of guns or other weapons. The popular app, which was created as a “female-first” dating service, will search through all of its members’ profiles and remove images with weapons. The company plans to filter out any mention or discussion of guns in written content as well, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd told The New York Times. The new policy won’t apply to people working in law enforcement or in the military. Herd said that some gun owners, such as competitive sports shooters, could appeal to the company to keep their gun photos on the site.  In a blog post published on Monday, Bumble wrote:    Bumble was founded with safety in mind. From the start, our mission has been to build a social network rooted in respect and kindness.Online behavior can both mirror and predict how people treat each other in the real world. Bumble has a responsibility to our users and a larger goal to encourage accountability offline. In the past, when we’ve had an opportunity to make our platform safer, we’ve taken action, banning hate speech and inappropriate sexual content from the Bumble app.As mass shootings continue to devastate communities across the country, it’s time to state unequivocally that gun violence is not in line with our values, nor do these weapons belong on Bumble. From today on, we will begin the process of moderating all new and previously uploaded photos for the presence of guns.* Our terms and conditions will be updated to reflect this decision.Bumble is also making a $100,000 donation to March For Our Lives, the organization founded by the brave young survivors of the Parkland tragedy. We stand with them, and join them in working towards a non-violent future. *This excludes users in military or law enforcement in uniform.",BUSINESS,TECH
Hedge Fund To Launch Proxy Fight To Remove Yahoo's Entire Board: Report,"Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which is leading an investor revolt against Yahoo Inc's management team, is seeking to remove the entire board of the struggling Internet company, the Wall Street Journal reported. The activist investor, which owns about 0.75 percent of Yahoo, plans to announce Thursday morning that it will nominate nine directors to Yahoo's board, the Journal said, citing a Starboard letter. ""The board and management have continually failed to live up to their own promises and shouldn't be trusted with the decision on whether Yahoo should remain an independent company,"" the paper reported, citing the letter. Starboard has been pushing for changes at Yahoo since 2014, asking it to separate its Asian assets and sell the core business. Reuters reported on March 4 that Yahoo executives would meet this month with Starboard Value. The two sides will discuss whether they can come to an agreement in order to avoid a proxy fight for control of Yahoo. Shareholders have until March 26 to submit nominations for board members to be elected at Yahoo's annual meeting this spring. Starboard has said it is willing to launch a proxy fight with its own nominations. Telecommunications company Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and publisher Time Inc (TIME.N) are among the companies expected to bid for Yahoo's core business, while some private equity firms are expected to team up to make offers. Representatives at Yahoo and Starboard Value could not be reached for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.",TECH,BUSINESS

Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index Misleading Or Meaningless Or Both?,"Like many of us, I thought that the Dow Jones industrial Average index (DJIA) is comprising thirty of the most important companies of the United States of America by using their market capitalization.  I was completely wrong. There is no correlation between the importance of the companies and the index.  According to Wikipedia, DJIA is criticized for being a price weighted  average, which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the  average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of  the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components. For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger percentage change. In addition, a $1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a $1 move in the largest component of the average.  Journalists have been using the DJIA as THE indicator of the strength of 30 of the largest companies in the United States. Size matters for the selection of the companies. Why does it not matter for the weighting of those companies? Analyzing the composition might be an eye opener! God bless Goldman Sachs! Among the 30 companies composing the  DJIA index, Goldman Sachs has the lion share. Yes, tiny Goldman is approaching a record $ 100 billion market capitalization. It had a record price yesterday. But few investors might know that 8.32% of the index is represented by Goldman Sachs. Yes, you read well. Each time an investor buys a dollar of the index one twelfth of that money is invested in Goldman Sachs shares. This is pure bonanza, but might explain some of the market value of Goldman. This is confirmed by the fact that an important portion of the twenty largest shareholders of Goldman Sachs are Exchange Traded Funds or indexed funds.  But it is also totally unfair: it gives a structural advantage to Goldman Sachs vis-à-vis its competitors of Wall Street. The next bank, JP Morgan Chase (#16) is only gratified of a 3.01% share while its market capitalization is $ 327 billion.  With three times the market cap, JP Morgan Chase is only weighted as 40% of Goldman Sachs. In total, the four companies representing financial sector only represents 16.83% of the DJIA, contrary to conventional wisdom.  What about General Electric? I do not want to give a heart attack to my former boss and friend, Jack Welch, and my former GE colleagues. However, General Electric is # 30 out of #30. The least important company of the Dow Jones. The fact that it would have a $ 270 billion market capitalization (2.7x Goldman) is irrelevant. It is gratified with a share of 1.10%. When one dollar goes to the DJIA, 8.3 go to Goldman and 1 to General Electric. Should #8 McDonald be worth 4.20% ($ 105 billion) when Coca Cola ($ 177 billion) # 26 is worth 1.34%. The bottom ten include Microsoft, Intel and Cisco. Why would United Healthcare be # 5 with 5.46% when Pfizer is # 28 with 1.11%.  Telling the truth No, the index is not manipulated. It has a methodology that explains those aberrations. The DJIA, by not being based on market capitalization, does not represent the substance of the components from an investor’s viewpoint. . It should therefore not be the bell weather of Wall Street. The media, and  particularly the Wall Street Journal, have made the DJIA what it is not: an index representing the values of 30 American corporations.  Time for the SEC to look whether the DJIA might need to be more transparent to investors?  Maybe the media should reconsider this index that, in fact, is meaningless. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS

Trump Praises Late Mom On Mother's Day But Skips Mention Of Melania,"President Donald Trump praised his late mother as “incredible” in a Mother’s Day video on Sunday but made no mention of his wife, Melania, who’s the mother of his youngest son. Nor did he mention his two ex-wives, with whom he had four other children, in a message posted to Twitter. Trump recognized the holiday as “one of the most important days of the year,” calling it “a special opportunity to honor all of the mothers and grandmothers in our lives.” “She was just incredible,” he said of his late mother, Mary MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. “Warm, loving, really smart, could be tough if she had to be, but basically she was a really nice person. Happy Mother’s Day!!! pic.twitter.com/zw71dnT7TJ “So much of what I’ve done and so much of what I’ve become is because of my mother. I miss her a lot,” he said. Trump’s mother died in 2000. First lady Melania Trump has made motherhood her primary role in the White House. Along with caring for the couple’s 12-year-old son, Barron, she is focusing on children through her “Be Best” campaign. Last week, she reflected on the enormous amount of work that goes into being a mom at an event for military mothers at the White House. “It takes an incredible amount of strength, a lot of time, a generous amount of patience, and all of our love,” she said. “As moms, we are so incredibly privileged to be able to bring children into this world and be a part of helping them grow into adults.” Vice President Mike Pence posted a Mother’s Day tribute on Sunday that saluted the ladies in his life ― his mother, Nancy Fritsch, and his wife, Karen, who he boasted is “the best mom 3 kids could ever have!” Happy Mother’s Day to my amazing Mom, Nancy Fritsch, to my wonderful wife, Karen (the best Mom 3 kids could ever have!) and to all of America's incredible Moms!

12 Daily Habits Of Exceptional Leaders,"One of the most popular Dilbert comic strips in the cartoon’s history begins with Dilbert’s boss relaying senior leadership’s explanation for the company’s low profits. In response to his boss, Dilbert asks incredulously, “So they’re saying that profits went up because of great leadership and down because of a weak economy?” To which Dilbert’s boss replies, “These meetings will go faster if you stop putting things in context.” Great leadership is indeed a difficult thing to pin down and understand. You know a great leader when you’re working for one, but even they can have a hard time explaining the specifics of what they do that makes their leadership so effective. Great leaders change us for the better. They see more in us than we see in ourselves, and they help us learn to see it too. They dream big and show us all the great things we can accomplish. Great leadership is dynamic; it melds a variety of unique skills into an integrated whole. Great leadership is also founded in good habits. What follows are the essential habits that exceptional leaders rely on every day. Give them a try and see where they take your leadership skills. 1. Effective Communication “The more elaborate our means of communication, the less we communicate.” —Joseph Priestley Communication is the real work of leadership. It’s a fundamental element of how leaders accomplish their goals each and every day. You simply can’t become a great leader until you are a great communicator. Great communicators inspire people. They listen. They create a connection with their followers that is real, emotional, and personal, regardless of any physical distance between them. Great communicators forge this connection through an understanding of people and an ability to speak directly to their needs. 2. Courage “Courage is the first virtue that makes all other virtues possible.” —Aristotle People will wait to see if a leader is courageous before they’re willing to follow his or her lead. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show courage themselves when their leaders do the same. For the courageous leader adversity is a welcome test. Like a blacksmith’s molding of a red-hot iron, adversity is a trial by fire that refines leaders and sharpens their game. Adversity emboldens courageous leaders and leaves them more committed to their strategic direction. Leaders who lack courage simply toe the company line. They follow the safest path—the path of least resistance—because they’d rather cover their backside than lead. 3. Adherence to the Golden Rule +1 “The way you see people is the way you treat them, and the way you treat them is what they become.” —Jon Wolfgang von Goethe The Golden Rule – treat others as you want to be treated – assumes that all people are the same. It assumes that, if you treat your followers the way you would want a leader to treat you, they’ll be happy. It ignores that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention. Great leaders don’t treat people how they themselves want to be treated. Instead, they take the Golden Rule a step further and treat each person as he or she would like to be treated. Great leaders learn what makes people tick, recognize their needs in the moment, and adapt their leadership style accordingly. 4. Self-Awareness “It is absurd that a man should rule others, who cannot rule himself.” —Latin Proverb Contrary to what Dilbert might have us believe, leaders’ gaps in self-awareness are rarely due to deceitful, Machiavellian motives, or severe character deficits. In most cases, leaders—like everyone else—view themselves in a more favorable light than other people do. Self-awareness is the foundation of emotional intelligence, a skill that 90% of top performing leaders possess in abundance. Great leaders’ high self-awareness means they have a clear and accurate image not just of their leadership style, but also of their own strengths and weaknesses. They know where they shine and where they’re weak, and they have effective strategies for leaning into their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. 5. Passion “If you just work on stuff that you like and are passionate about, you don’t have to have a master plan with how things will play out.” —Mark Zuckerberg Passion and enthusiasm are contagious. So are boredom and apathy. No one wants to work for a boss that’s unexcited about his or her job, or even one who’s just going through the motions. Great leaders are passionate about what they do, and they strive to share that passion with everyone around them. 6. Humility “Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less.” —C.S. Lewis Great leaders are humble. They don’t allow their position of authority to make them feel that they are better than anyone else. As such, they don’t hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they won’t ask their followers to do anything they wouldn’t be willing to do themselves. 7. Generosity “A good leader is a person who takes a little more than his share of the blame and a little less than his share of the credit.” —John Maxwell Great leaders are generous. They share credit and offer enthusiastic praise. They’re as committed to their followers’ success as they are to their own. They want to inspire all of their employees to achieve their personal best – not just because it will make the team more successful, but because they care about each person as an individual. 8. Infectiousness “The very essence of leadership is that you have to have a vision. It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion. You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.” —Reverend Theodore Hesburgh Great leaders know that having a clear vision isn’t enough. You have to make that vision come alive so that your followers can see it just as clearly as you do. Great leaders do that by telling stories and painting verbal pictures so that everyone can understand not just where they’re going, but what it will look and feel like when they get there. This inspires others to internalize the vision and make it their own. 9. Authenticity “Just be who you are and speak from your guts and heart – it’s all a man has.” —Hubert Humphrey Authenticity refers to being honest in all things – not just what you say and do, but who you are. When you’re authentic, your words and actions align with who you claim to be. Your followers shouldn’t be compelled to spend time trying to figure out if you have ulterior motives. Any time they spend doing so erodes their confidence in you and in their ability to execute. Leaders who are authentic are transparent and forthcoming. They aren’t perfect, but they earn people’s respect by walking their talk. 10. Approachability “Management is like holding a dove in your hand. Squeeze too hard and you kill it, not hard enough and it flies away.” —Tommy Lasorda Great leaders make it clear that they welcome challenges, criticism, and viewpoints other than their own. They know that an environment where people are afraid to speak up, offer insight, and ask good questions is destined for failure. By ensuring that they are approachable, great leaders facilitate the flow of great ideas throughout the organization. 11. Accountability “The ancient Romans had a tradition: Whenever one of their engineers constructed an arch, as the capstone was hoisted into place, the engineer assumed accountability for his work in the most profound way possible: He stood under the arch.” —Michael Armstrong Great leaders have their followers’ backs. They don’t try to shift blame, and they don’t avoid shame when they fail. They’re never afraid to say, “The buck stops here,” and they earn people’s trust by backing them up. 12. A Sense Of Purpose “You don’t lead by pointing and telling people some place to go. You lead by going to that place and making a case.” —Ken Kesey Whereas vision is a clear idea of where you’re going, a sense of purpose refers to an understanding of why you’re going there. People like to feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves. Great leaders give people that feeling. Bringing It All Together Becoming a great leader doesn’t mean that you have to incorporate all of these traits at once. Focus on one or two at a time; each incremental improvement will make you more effective. It’s okay if you “act” some of these qualities at first. The more you practice, the more instinctive it will become, and the more you’ll internalize your new leadership style. Please share your thoughts on exceptional leadership in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. Want to learn more from me?

Great news but begs the question, ""Why was Daily Stormer's routinely vile content ever allowed in the first place? And are there others?"" GoDaddy has not yet responded to HuffPosts’ requests for comments on either issue.  Over the weekend, The Daily Stormer made headlines for praising President Donald Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville. Trump outraged Democrats and Republicans when he failed to credit white supremacists for inciting violence, instead opting to cast blame on “many sides” for the events that occurred.  “No condemnation at all,” Andrew Anglin, the website’s founder, wrote. “When asked to condemn, [Trump] just walked out of the room. Really, really good.

"U.S., China Putting Trade War On Hold, Treasury's Steve Mnuchin Says","WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday. Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. “We are putting the trade war on hold. Right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,” Mnuchin said in a television interview on “Fox News Sunday.” On Saturday, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to close the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China. During an initial round of talks earlier this month in Beijing, Washington demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries’ joint statement on Saturday. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross planned to go to China, Mnuchin and Kudlow said. “He’s going to be looking into a number of areas where we’re going to have greatly significant increases,” including energy, liquefied natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, Kudlow said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.” Mnuchin said the United States expects to see a big increase of between 35 percent and 40 percent in agricultural exports to China and a doubling of energy purchases over the next three to five years. “We have specific targets. I am not going to publicly disclose what they are. They go industry by industry,” Mnuchin said.

Protecting Dolphins: A Right to Life,"One of the daily privileges of living in southern California along the Santa Monica Bay is watching pods of bottlenose dolphins patrolling the coastline. They are extraordinary creatures with astounding memories that bring joy to my day - each time I see them.

My students and I believe that dolphins are entitled to the right of life. We along with millions of other Earthlings are mortified that Japan and Faroe Islanders brutally slaughter small-toothed whales and dolphins i.e. Faroe Islands and Taiji Cove with such reckless abandon and a despicable sense of entitlement. Those unfortunate dolphins not slaughtered but caught are sentenced to an unimaginable captivity - suffering a brutal and torturous existence in dolphinariums for the amusement of unconscious humans. Have you seen the documentary Blackfish? Since July 1, my colleagues and I have witnessed bottlenose dolphins dying along the eastern seaboard from New York to the Carolina's (and soon predicted along Florida) at ten times the normal death rates, washing ashore emaciated, shark bitten with shocking skin lesions. So far over 375 have perished with predictions suggesting casualties will at least double before a morbillivirus, which is implicated in their deaths, abates. In addition, it is worrisome that polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs are showing up in high concentrations off-coast Georgia. Although banned in the U.S. since 1979 they remain at manufacturing sites bleeding carcinogenic toxicity into soils and waterways for many decades.  The truth of the matter is that our oceans are desperately sick; my forthcoming book 'Shepherding the Sea' delves into many of those details. In the meantime, dolphins and whales are in big trouble - naval and oil exploration sonar are shattering their eardrums, cargo ships are ramming them, 13 million miles or 27 return trips to the moon of hooked and monofilament fishing lines are ensnaring them or cutting them badly, their autoimmune systems are so over-compromised from mercury poisoning (a by-product of coal-fired power plants) and toxic micro-plastics acting as sponges laced with high concentrations of potent man-made poisons; these awesome sea creatures are now susceptible to many viruses whereby pneumonia sets in, quickly. My colleagues have clearly shown that both filter feeding whales e.g. humpbacks and large- and small-toothed whales (i.e. dolphins) play an essential role in keeping the web of sealife intact and vibrant. The filter feeders fertilize the ocean with their nitrogen-rich flocculent fecal plumes, stimulating phytoplankton, enriching the marine ecosystem, and creating abundant fisheries. Toothed whales cull the old and weak fish and seal populations preventing diseases from reaching epidemics and ensuring a high level of fitness throughout the seas. The Japanese and Faroe Island bloodlust is barbaric and it is fueling the death of the sea - their repugnant sense of entitlement must end, now! The Japanese government recently called demonstrators in Tokyo 'environmental terrorists' for drawing attention to the beginning of yet another dolphin slaughter season. Shame on them for their incorrigible misuse of the word 'terrorism.' Those that stand-up for nature and the rights of sealife are intrepid and indeed worthy of praise. Those, on the other hand, that authorize and profit from killing or torturing of nature and the destruction of our living biosphere are perpetrating global crimes against all children and their birthrights on planet Earth.

Amazing Fossil Find Shows Bug Inside Lizard Inside Snake,"It’s the food chain as you’ve never seen it before ― unless you were around 48 million years ago. Researchers working at Germany’s Messel Pit, a disused quarry near Frankfurt, recently discovered a fossil that shows a bug inside a lizard inside a snake. Or as Discover magazine calls it: “essentially a prehistoric turducken.” The magnitude of this find can’t be overstated: This is only the second time a fossil showing the culinary habits of so many creatures at once has been discovered, according to the scientific journal Paleobiodiversity and Paleoenvironments. The first such discovery happened in 2008 in southwest Germany when researchers found a fossil of a fish inside an amphibian inside a shark. Paleontologist Krister Smith of Germany’s Senckenberg Institute led the analysis of the snake-lizard-bug fossil and still can’t get over the find. “It’s probably the kind of fossil that I will go the rest of my professional life without ever encountering again, such is the rarity of these things,” he told National Geographic. “It was pure astonishment.”  Researchers don’t know how the snake died. But back then, the Messel Pit was a volcanic lake with toxic waters that possibly belched out clouds of poisonous carbon dioxide, which could have asphyxiated the animal, according to National Geographic. Another possibility is that the snake died near the lake and washed into it. Because the lizard is so well preserved, the researchers think the snake died no more than one to two days after consuming its prey, Smith said in a press release, which was published in German. The snake then likely sank to the bottom of the lake, where it was fossilized. The snake measures 40 inches long, which makes Smith think it was a juvenile. The lizard was nearly 8 inches long and, despite being swallowed whole, still had an intact head crest, according to the press release. Previous fossils of prehistoric lizards found only vegetable remains. This new find suggests they may have been omnivores. Researchers said they could not determine the exact type of bug, since it wasn’t well-preserved. Hey, you see if you look good after 48 million years.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Pennsylvania's Congressional Delegation Will No Longer Be All Men,"Pennsylvania is all but certain to finally have a woman in its 20-member congressional delegation next year.  Right now, Pennsylvania is the largest state without a woman in either the House or the Senate. The state’s never had a female senator, and the last woman to serve in its 18-member House contingent was Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a Democrat who retired in 2015. But Tuesday’s primaries brought big wins for women politicians in Pennsylvania. In the newly drawn 5th Congressional District, Republican Pearl Kim will face Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon in November, meaning that barring an unforeseen circumstance, at least one woman will be going to Congress from the state in 2019. The 5th district seat is being vacated by Rep. Pat Meehan (R), who announced he would be resigning after one of his female staffers accused him of sexually harassing her. Six women ran in the 10-candidate Democratic primary, more than in any other House district in the country. The seat leans Democratic. Kim is a former state prosecutor and Scanlon is a public interest lawyer. State Rep. Madeleine Dean (D) won in the 4th Congressional District, which is considered a safe Democratic seat. Elsewhere in the Keystone state, Democrats Chrissy Houlahan (6th Congressional District) and Susan Wild (7th Congressional District) won their primaries. They will face off against male Republicans for seats that Democrats are targeting to flip. Pennsylvania also lags behind in its female representation at the state government level, with women comprising just 19 percent of the members of its legislature.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Pita Taufatofua Goes Shirtless One Last Time For Closing Ceremony,"Tongan flag bearer and fan favorite Pita Taufatofua helped bring the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to a close Sunday by baring his oiled torso one last time.  At first, Taufatofua ― whose chiseled appearance at the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics set pulses racing and made him a viral sensation ― entered the closing festivities at the Winter Games bundled up in a heavy coat. (And who could blame him? Temperatures in Pyeongchang reportedly hovered around 31 degrees Fahrenheit Sunday.)  But rest assured: he soon doffed his seasonally appropriate duds, stripping down to little more than a red-and-black grass skirt, a pair of gloves and a smile.  “I’ve got to stay warm, get the flowers out, let people see the color of Polynesia,” he told USA Today. “What’s different here is that we’re no longer individual countries. We’re coming out together. That’s why I’m dressed the way I am. We’re all together, all the same.” It’s been an eventful two weeks for Taufatofua, who competed as a cross-country skier. He didn’t exactly wow on the snow, finishing 114th out of 119 competitors in the 15K cross-country event.  The 34-year-old’s only goal, however, was not to finish last. He told NBC, “It’s not about winning medals for me. It’s about inspiring people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, to not fear failure, to fail and then laugh at it and then try again.” It’s safe to say he succeeded.  CORRECTION: A wire photo caption in a previous version of this story misidentified North Korean skater Ryom Tae-ok. ",SPORTS,SPORTS

Gina Haspel Tried To Withdraw From Consideration To Lead The CIA: Report,"Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, sought to withdraw herself from consideration to avoid any potential damage to the agency’s reputation and her own, The Washington Post reported Sunday. Haspel is a 30-year CIA veteran widely respected by her colleagues as deputy director. But her past role in the CIA’s use of brutal interrogation measures on terrorism suspects has generated bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill, where she is scheduled to answer questions during a confirmation hearing next week. As the head of a clandestine base in Thailand in 2002, Haspel oversaw the interrogation of one terror suspect that reportedly included techniques like waterboarding. The torture sessions were videotaped, and Haspel also reportedly played a part in the tapes’ destruction in 2005. The CIA has disputed this, however, saying her superior was responsible for the decision to do so. Haspel was summoned to the White House on Friday to review her role in the controversial program, where she faced “urgent questions” from administration officials about “material being raised in questions from Congress,” according to the Post. Some records from the program, the newspaper reported, show that Haspel “was an enthusiastic supporter of what the CIA was doing.” During the meeting, the report added, Haspel told White House officials she wanted to withdraw her nomination in order to protect the reputation of the agency and so as to not become what she called “the next Ronny Jackson,” referring to the White House physician Trump nominated for secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs who withdrew over allegations of misconduct. The suggestion alarmed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and legislative affairs director Marc Short, who reportedly rushed to the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Friday to meet with Haspel after she left the White House in order to talk her out of pulling out. By Saturday, the deputy CIA director had agreed to stick with it. Haspel’s last-minute second-guessing of whether to maintain her bid is indicative of the uphill climb her nomination faces in Congress. The prolonged absence of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and the previously stated opposition of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) would give Democrats leverage over her nomination ― if they stick together, that is. According to the Post, Short told Haspel she could still be confirmed despite the questions over her role in the interrogation program. Sanders, meanwhile, tweeted an endorsement of Haspel on Friday. The senior White House aide also accused Democrats of hypocrisy over their opposition to a female nominee.  There is no one more qualified to be the first woman to lead the CIA than 30+ year CIA veteran Gina Haspel. Any Democrat who claims to support women’s empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination is a total hypocrite",POLITICS,POLITICS
Twitter's Latest Anti-Troll Measure Is Perfectly Timed,"There's something about the internet that can bring out the absolute worst in people.  In their typical fashion, some Twitter trolls spewed homophobic and Islamophobic sentiments following Sunday's mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida. The suspect in the massacre reportedly pledged allegiance to the self-described Islamic State group during the attack.  So Twitter's announcement on Monday that users can more comprehensively block each other came at a great time.  Starting today, we're making Block easier to help you control your Twitter experience. https://t.co/8pee8rzN1I pic.twitter.com/gCzkTwoglP It used to be that someone you had blocked on Twitter could see still your content if it was quoted in tweets or retweets, a spokeswoman for the company said. ""Now, when you block someone you’ll be able to prevent them from contacting you or seeing your Tweets in any form when logged in,"" she told The Huffington Post.  Someone you've blocked will no longer be able to follow you or send you a direct message. Their tweets won't appear on your timeline, and you won't get a notification if they mention you.  Twitter said the launch of the improved block feature was not in response to any particular event or cultural threat.  The caveat to this improved functionality is that the onus to fight trolls still falls almost entirely on the subject of abuse. Because tweets post instantly without any screening, users still have to have a negative experience before they can block their harassers.  Still, the updated blocking function is a step in the right direction, considering that 40 percent of all internet users say they have experienced harassment online. ""Mean tweets"" have even become a cultural phenomenon. And if blocking malicious accounts is easier than ever before, perhaps people will be able to express their views when they matter most. ",TECH,TECH
9/11 Mastermind Waterboarded By CIA Has Information To Share About Gina Haspel,"Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks, says he has information to share with lawmakers about CIA head nominee Gina Haspel ahead of her Senate confirmation hearing. Mohammed, who was repeatedly tortured by the CIA following his 2003 capture in Pakistan, sought permission this week from a Guantanamo Bay judge to “share six paragraphs of information” about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, reported The New York Times. From Guantanamo, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed wants to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee something about Gina Haspel. https://t.co/u5jowMhzyQ Haspel, who has drawn criticism for her role in a controversial CIA interrogation program, faces what is likely to be a tough confirmation hearing before the committee on Wednesday. The nature of Mohammed’s information about Haspel is unknown. One of his attorneys, Marine Lt. Col. Derek Poteet, told the Times that he was “not able to describe the information.” Poteet said that it comes directly from Mohammed and that defense lawyers “agreed that the information was important.” The CIA used several torture techniques on Mohammed, including waterboarding him 183 times and subjecting him to sleep deprivation and rectal rehydration, while the al Qaeda operative was in custody in clandestine prisons in Afghanistan and Poland.  It’s not clear whether Haspel was involved in Mohammed’s torture in any way. She has come under scrutiny, however, for serving as the head of a black site prison in Thailand in the early-2000s, where another terror suspect was tortured. Haspel has been accused of playing a part in destroying videotapes of those sessions. Haspel is expected to tell lawmakers that she “will not restart” the CIA’s controversial interrogation program as the agency’s director. It’s unclear whether Mohammed’s request for permission to share the information about Haspel will be approved before Wednesday’s hearing.",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Four New Man-Made Gases Found That Harm Ozone Layer, Scientists Say","By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent OSLO, March 9 (Reuters) - Scientists have detected four new  man-made gases that damage the Earth's protective ozone layer,  despite bans on almost all production of similar gases under a  1987 treaty, a study showed on Sunday. The experts were trying to pinpoint industrial sources of  tiny traces of the new gases, perhaps used in making pesticides  or refrigerants, that were found in Greenland's ice and in air  samples in Tasmania, Australia. The ozone layer shields the planet from damaging  ultra-violet rays, which can cause skin cancer and eye  cataracts, and has been recovering after a phase-out of damaging  chemicals under the U.N.'s 1987 Montreal Protocol. ""The concentrations are not yet a threat to the ozone  layer,"" lead author Johannes Laube of the University of East  Anglia in England told Reuters of the three types of CFCs  (chlorofluorocarbon) and one HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon). In total, the scientists estimated more than 74,000 tonnes  of the four had been released to the atmosphere. None was  present before the 1960s in Greenland's ice cores, according to  the study in the journal Nature Geoscience. That is only a small fraction of the million tonnes of CFCs  produced every year at a 1980s peak, according to the team of  scientists in Britain, Germany, Australia, France, the  Netherlands and Switzerland.                 LOOPHOLES Laube said it was unknown if the emissions of the new gases  were illegal, since the Montreal Protocol has some exemptions.  ""We hope to tighten the loopholes,"" he said. A hole in the ozone layer was found in the 1980s over  Antarctica but bans on damaging chemicals, for instance used in  hairsprays, foams and refrigerants, means it is on target to  recover in the next 50 years. HCFCs have often been used to replace more damaging CFCs. One of the newly discovered CFCs was worrying since  concentrations were rising fast, Laube said. Such emission  increases had not been spotted for other CFCs since the 1990s. The gases were detected earlier in Greenland than Tasmania,  indicating they were produced in the northern hemisphere and  then blown south. Research planes, taking air samples around the  world, may be able to find the sources, Laube said. ""While these newly discovered gases can, in theory, cause  some damage to the ozone layer, their combined abundance is over  500 times smaller than that of the main ozone-destroying  compounds in the 1990s,"" said Martyn Chipperfield, a professor  of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Leeds. ""These new observations do not present concern at the  moment, although the fact that these gases are in the atmosphere  and some are increasing needs investigation,"" he said. Laube said the gases are also likely to be powerful  greenhouse gases, albeit in tiny amounts. CFCs are often  thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping  heat in the atmosphere.     (Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Mike Collett-White)",ENVIRONMENT,SCIENCE
"Lobbyist Friend Helped Scott Pruitt Plan $100,000 Trip To Morocco: Reports","Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt’s costly visit to Morocco last year was partly planned by a lobbyist friend, according to news reports. The disclosure raises fresh questions about the purpose of Pruitt’s controversial visit, which reportedly cost taxpayers more than $100,000. Some also question whether the lobbyist, reportedly hired soon after the trip by the Moroccan government to promote the country’s “cultural and economic interests,” benefited financially from his relationship to the embattled EPA chief. The New York Times and The Washington Post separately reported that Richard Smotkin, a former Comcast lobbyist who has known Pruitt for many years, helped to plan the EPA administrator’s trip to Morocco in December. Both papers published articles online Tuesday night and in Wednesday’s print editions. The EPA confirmed that Smotkin facilitated an initial meeting in October between Pruitt and Morocco’s ambassador to the U.S., reported the Post. It was at that meeting that the ambassador, Lalla Joumala, invited Pruitt to visit Morocco. Smotkin reportedly then helped organize several meetings for Pruitt in the country, including one with OCP Group, a state-owned phosphate mining company. Smotkin was a “near-constant presence” during Pruitt’s trip, the Post reported, serving as “an informal liaison at both official and social events.” What does this story say? Scott Pruitt allowed a lobbyist friend to play an unusually influential role in setting his agenda during a visit in December to Morocco. Then just after the trip, friend is hired as a foreign agent. DOCUMENTS HERE https://t.co/oGjByYKxr8 The EPA did not deny that Smotkin had attended some of Pruitt’s meetings in Morocco, but downplayed the role that the lobbyist played in orchestrating the visit. “EPA’s Office of International and Tribal Affairs organized and led the effort around Administrator Pruitt’s official meetings with the Moroccan government,” EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement Tuesday, according to the Times. “Additionally, Mr. Smotkin did not attend or participate in any official meetings with the Moroccan government.” Still, concerns have been raised about Smotkin’s involvement in the trip, with the two reports pointing out how unusual it is for a person outside government to arrange travel plans for a Cabinet official. The Times noted that Pruitt has done this at least once before since becoming the head of the EPA. Pruitt reportedly recruited another friend, Leonard Leo, head of the Federalist Society, to help him plan his trip to Italy last June. But it was not just the trip to Morocco. On the trip Pruitt took to Italy last June, Leonard Leo, one of the top executives of conservative legal group whose top funders include Charles & David Koch and Chevron, set up visits for Pruitt to the Vatican. pic.twitter.com/vo7SdV63sQ Smotkin’s close ties to the Moroccan government, which date back to at least 2016, are also raising questions. Smotkin recently signed a $40,000-a-month lobbying contract with the Moroccan government to “craft an outreach program” that includes helping to promote the country as a film and “world-class golf” destination. Documents filed with the Department of Justice in April show that Smotkin’s work with the Moroccan government began Jan. 1 ― just weeks after Pruitt’s visit. Larry Noble, senior director at the Campaign Legal Center, told the Post that Smotkin’s role in Pruitt’s trip raises questions about whether the visit helped the lobbyist get his new job with the Moroccan government. Public officials are prohibited under federal law from using their position to financially benefit their friends and relatives. “It shows, at the very least, a tremendous amount of sloppiness, and it raises ethical issues about the relationship between Smotkin and Pruitt,” Noble said. “If Pruitt did this to benefit Smotkin and did this to show that Smotkin has an in with the EPA administrator, then he’s using his official office to benefit a private person.”  Pruitt’s Morocco trip had already been drawing criticism and scrutiny from lawmakers and others. Last week, members of two congressional oversight committees quizzed Pruitt on choices he’d made as the head of the EPA, including the purpose of the Morocco visit and why he’d spent part of his time in the country promoting U.S. liquefied natural gas. “I can’t, for the life of me, imagine why an EPA administrator would be over there promoting energy sales,” Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a member of the House Appropriations subcommittee, said to Pruitt on Thursday. The high cost of the four-day trip has also attracted scrutiny. (The Post reported on Tuesday that the visit cost more than $100,000 ― more than double what had previously been reported.) Pruitt has defended the trip as being part of an effort to negotiate the environmental chapter of a new bilateral trade agreement between Morocco and the United States. As for his promotion of liquefied natural gas, he told lawmakers last week that he’d only done that because the Moroccan ambassador had asked him to discuss the topic while he was in the country. Pruitt is currently facing at least 11 federal investigations into his spending habits and other potential ethics issues, including a $50-a-night condo he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist and money he’s spent on security and lavish office furnishings. On Tuesday, two of Pruitt’s top aides, including the head of his security detail, abruptly resigned.",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Actress Rachelle Lefevre Takes On Car Idlers, Pollution In Hilarious PSA","From Mother Nature Network Guest Columnist Rachelle Lefevre: Growing up in a cold, Canadian climate you get used to morning radio shows doling out cheerful tidbits like wind chill factors and frostbite warnings in between upbeat tunes to help you start the day. When winter is six months of the year and feels like nine, you will do just about anything to beat the cold. One of these time-honored traditions is what I used to call the “defrost dash” — a heroic run in one’s haphazardly flung-on coat or bathrobe to the car parked out front in order to start the engine 10 minutes before actual departure.

Leaving the engine running and the heat and defrost blasting, one can enjoy the last few bites of breakfast knowing the car will be toasty warm and good to go when it’s time to leave. Now, I admit that there were days when this extra engine running was a necessity and not doing so would have meant, at best, 15 agonizing minutes scraping ice from the windshield with numb fingers or, at worst, not being able to clear the windshield at all. Even then though, it bothered me. The view of the car just sitting there, the exhaust spewing light grayish fumes into the air, looked wasteful and dirty. I hadn’t yet declared myself an “environmentalist” and the term “climate change” hadn’t been coined but I’m pretty sure the sight of those neighborhood cars prompted one of my first, early utterances of the question, “Isn’t that bad for the environment?”

It’s only fair to admit here that I am far from perfect in my attempt at an eco-friendly lifestyle; the carbon footprint of a life involving frequent airline travel, Los Angeles traffic and air conditioning sadly still outweighs my “green” choices. That, however, doesn’t mean the choices I do make are meaningless. Almost every leader of any great movement in history has probably at some point credited the baby steps, the individual choices we make, however small they may seem at the time, with creating the momentum that led to extraordinary change. And so I keep up with the “little things” and try to continually add to the list: turning off the light when I leave a room, washing my clothes in short cycles of cold water, turning off the faucet while I brush my teeth, and a host of other habits that are proven to help preserve our environment. Which brings me back to those neighborhood cars.

I could have started this piece by just giving you the facts, telling you that leaving an engine running unnecessarily for only two minutes burns the gas equivalent of one mile of driving and in the U.S. alone costs Americans about $3.6 billion of their hard earned dollars; that this habit of ours is releasing a million pounds of climate-altering carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every second. I could have debunked myths like this one: Leaving the car running is better than turning off and restarting the engine. Incorrect! Fuel wise, starting a car is equal to only 10 seconds of letting it run so if the car’s going to be motionless for more than 10 seconds, turn off the engine.

But I’m a storyteller by trade and so that approach didn’t appeal to me. I’d rather paint an image (a cold winter day and a dirty exhaust pipe) and then give you a catchy name to go with it, like, ""Idling."" Idling is how environmentalists refer to that nasty habit of leaving your engine running when the car is not in motion. Waiting for someone outside their house or workplace with the car on equals idling. Keeping the car running so you have heat or A/C while you text from your parking spot equals idling. Finishing emails in the parking lot with the engine going equals — you guessed it — idling.

Not only is this all too common habit of ours devastating to the environment, it’s also so easy to change. Sometimes we get lucky and really bad problems come with really easy solutions: Turn off the engine while you’re waiting for someone or using your cell phone. If it gets too hot, get out of the car. If it gets too cold, duck into a nearby building to warm up. Line at the valet or drive-thru really slow? Turn off the car and wait until you can actually drive forward an entire car length or two before turning it back on to pull up. With a little conscious effort we can end this damaging habit right now and take one more crucial baby step towards cleaner air and a healthier environment.

And for my friends up north still living through bad winters — turns out 30 seconds after you turn on the car, driving is the best way to warm up the engine. So, bundle up for a bit of cold and as soon as you can see out the windshield start driving to your destination, it’ll only be cold for that first few minutes. You do that, and I’ll continue not dropping my A/C below 76 degrees here in Los Angeles even on the hottest days, and believe me, they’re only getting hotter.

Trump Briefly Responds To Santa Fe School Shooting Before Pivoting,"President Donald Trump expressed “sadness and heartbreak” over the deadly shooting at a high school in Texas on Friday morning.  He spoke for around 90 seconds ahead of planned remarks on prison reform during a summit at the White House. “This has been going on too long in our country. Too many years, too many decades now,” the president said of school shootings. He called the Texas incident “absolutely horrific.” The attack at Santa Fe High School left at least eight dead, according to local news outlets citing law enforcement. Santa Fe, Texas, is around 35 miles southeast of Houston. “To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High, we’re with you in this tragic hour and we’ll be with you forever,” Trump said. “My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others.” “Everyone must work together at every level of government to keep our children safe,” the president continued. “May God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims’ families.” “Very sad day,” the president added. “Very, very sad.” “On another note, a very positive note, I’m honored to be here today with so many leaders across the nation who are committed to the crucial issue of prison reform,” Trump said in an awkward pivot to his planned remarks. A shooter has been arrested and another person of interest has been detained, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez announced. A fire alarm prompted students to flee the school, and the situation had been “contained” by late Friday morning, officials said. The total number of injured is not yet known. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is accepting patients from the school. Trump reportedly spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and pledged to “provide all appropriate federal assistance.” The incident in Santa Fe marks the 22nd U.S. school shooting of 2018, by CNN’s count. Trump ― who spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention earlier this month alongside Vice President Mike Pence ― has been sharply criticized for seemingly siding with the gun lobby against those pushing for gun policy reform in the wake of the February massacre in Parkland, Florida. No major gun reform legislation has been passed during Trump’s administration. In the weeks after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, the president proposed a plan that would arm some school personnel in an effort to make educational facilities safer. Many in education and law enforcement argued that the president’s plan would have the opposite effect. ",POLITICS,POLITICS

FCC Blocks Rules That Required Broadband Providers To Offer Better Protection Of Customers' Data,"U.S. regulators on Wednesday blocked some Obama administration rules on the eve of implementation, regulations that would have subjected broadband providers to stricter scrutiny than web sites face to protect customers’ private data. The reversal by the Trump administration’s U.S. Federal Communications Commission was a victory for internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. The rules aimed to protect personal consumer data. They would have subjected broadband internet service providers to more stringent data security requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google unit. The decision will “provide time” for the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission to devise “a comprehensive and consistent framework” to protect online privacy, the agency said in a statement. Internet service providers hailed the decision. Consumer advocates objected. Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, called it “a sensible, pro-consumer approach” in which “consumers remain protected by the safeguards in place for the past two years.” AT&T and Verizon also praised the action. But Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumer Reports magazine, called it “a troubling first step towards unraveling critical, pro-consumer online privacy protections.” The rules would have required internet service providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out. MacCleery said the Consumer Reports had “heard from more than 50,000 consumers who support these rules through petitions and comments directly to the FCC.” FCC Chair Ajit Pai and acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement said they would work to ensure a consistent privacy framework. “After all, Americans care about the overall privacy of their information when they use the internet, and they shouldn’t have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected differently depending on which part of the internet holds it,” they said. “The federal government shouldn’t favor one set of companies over another,” they added. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, objected in a statement that the agency “should be the ‘cop on the beat’” but instead “is leaving broadband customers without assurances that their providers will keep their data secure.” In October, Republican commissioners including Pai said the rules unfairly gave websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising.",TECH,TECH
"1,140 Economists Warn Trump Not To Make Great Depression Mistakes","More than 1,100 economists, including 14 Nobel Prize winners, have written a letter to President Donald Trump, along with Congress, warning against making the same trade mistakes that helped plunge America into the Great Depression. The 1,140 economists sent the letter Thursday amid a mounting international trade battle. Trump has imposed a number of tariffs, including on steel and aluminum imports, but has granted temporary reprieves to the European Union, Australia and a handful of other countries. The letter was intended to mirror a similar warning sent in 1930 that went unheeded. “In 1930, 1,028 economists urged Congress to reject the protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,” the authors wrote, citing a trade law that many economists are convinced deepened the Great Depression. The letter warns that protectionist trade barriers erected by Trump and his withdrawal from critical international trade agreements will hurt the U.S. far more than they will help the nation. “Today, Americans face a host of new protectionist activity, including threats to withdraw from trade agreements, misguided calls for new tariffs in response to trade imbalances, and the imposition of tariffs on washing machines, solar components, and even steel and aluminum used by US manufacturers,” said the letter, which was organized by the National Taxpayers Union. “Congress did not take economists’ advice in 1930, and Americans across the country paid the price. The undersigned ... strongly urge you not to repeat that mistake.” Economists to @realDonaldTrump: The 1930s called, and they want their trade policy back. @NTU https://t.co/cbdkw8sbai The letter warns that trade barriers will increase prices American consumers will pay for goods and will “injure the great majority of our citizens.”  The letter also notes that few people gain from trade barriers. Lifting language directly from the 1930 letter, the economists warn that construction, transportation and public utility workers; professionals; and workers in banks, hotels, newspaper offices, in the wholesale and retail trades and scores of other occupations would “clearly lose, since they produce no products which could be protected by tariff barriers.” In addition, the “vast majority of farmers” would be hurt both as consumers paying higher prices and as food producers whose products will face retaliatory barriers. The letter also warns that “bitterness” engendered by protectionist trade barriers is not conducive to world peace. “Economists are pretty united in their opposition to protectionist trade policy,” Bryan Riley, director of the NTU’s free-trade initiative, told Bloomberg. “It’s the economic equivalent of a flat-earth trade policy.” People might blame free trade for the decline in manufacturing “when in fact the changes have more to do with automation,” which will continue with or without trade barriers, he said. The changes aren’t being driven by public opinion, he said. “This is not a grassroots movement against imports or NAFTA. This is being driven from the top,” he added. There was no immediate response from the White House.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Trump's New 'Domestic Gag Rule' Would Strip Funds From Planned Parenthood,"The Trump administration will propose a new rule Friday that would block federal funds to any organization that provides or even shares space with an abortion provider ― a domestic version of the so-called “Global Gag Rule” the president reinstated and expanded last year.  The move would notably strip Title X funding from Planned Parenthood, which provides birth control, STI testing and treatment, and cancer screenings to more than one-third of the federal family planning program’s 4 million low-income patients. Planned Parenthood decried the move particularly in light of the news that billionaire Bill Gates said he had to explain to President Donald Trump ― twice ― the difference between HIV and HPV.  “This is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period,” Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, said in a call with reporters Friday. “I would posit that a president who it’s clear does not know the difference between HIV and HPV should not be interfering in the doctor-patient relationship.”  Anti-abortion advocates have been pushing Trump since the beginning of his term to fulfill his campaign promise to defund Planned Parenthood, especially since Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried and failed to do so. A coalition of conservative groups sent the administration a letter on May 1 urging them to take this step. “The pro-life grassroots are furious with the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to stop taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List. “We urge the Trump administration to act swiftly to revise the Title X regulations, stopping the flow of Title X dollars to abortion centers.” Federal law already prohibits public funds from being used to pay for abortions. Women who seek abortions at Planned Parenthood or other providers must cover the cost of the procedure themselves unless their insurance plan covers it. Trump’s proposed rule would strip funds used for birth control and STD testing from organizations like Planned Parenthood and roll back a requirement that providers who receive federal subsidies for family planning services offer women information about the full range of reproductive health options, including abortion. Progressives are pushing back. Earlier this week, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and 40 other senators sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services warning of the “devastating impact” of the proposed rule on communities of color, the uninsured, and low-income women in particular; over a hundred members of the House penned a similar letter. “This ‘gag rule’ would bar patients from receiving information to support their ability to make informed decisions about their own reproductive health,” the senators wrote.  The rule will be subject to a public comment period after it’s proposed, and reproductive rights groups are likely to challenge it in court. This story has been updated to correct a statistic provided by Planned Parenthood about the percentage of patients it serves from the federal family planning program.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Pretty Much Every Living Thing Is Already Feeling The Effects Of Climate Change,"Climate change has already touched almost all life on the planet, even under moderate rates of global warming, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Science. An international team of researchers found 82 percent of key biological processes necessary for healthy ecosystems had been impacted by the phenomenon. The changes have been felt even though the world is just 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. “We’re already seeing salamanders shrink in size, we’re seeing migratory birds change their migratory routes, we’re seeing species interbreeding now, because of just a small degree of warming,” said James Watson, a professor at the University of Queensland and senior author of the report. Scientists are currently gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, to work out details of the landmark Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep the world from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. Anything hotter than that will likely cause a slew of troubling events: melting glaciers, rising seas, extreme weather and an uptick in disease. But aside from severe impacts for humanity, those shifts will drastically change worldwide biology. “The fact is, it’s not one or two species in one or two places,” Watson said. “It’s entire systems and entire processes. All the things which live in those systems are almost certainly changing their behavior, the way they live, the way they move.” The recent election of Donald Trump has cast serious doubts on the future of the Paris deal. The U.S. is the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the president-elect, a denier of climate change, has threatened to pull out of the accord. A similar move by America with the Kyoto Protocol set the fight against climate change back 20 years. Leading environmental groups have stressed the need for urgency in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. “The climate crisis is already having very serious consequences for life on the planet,” said Jean Su, associate conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature already has the world spinning out of control in terms of the widespread harms to species, and also people ... The need for strong climate action couldn’t be clearer or as necessary as right now.” Su said the election of Trump “will purely galvanize grass-roots support for environmental action.” Watson said the report was “not just doom and gloom,” noting there was still time, albeit limited, to act on “low-hanging fruit” like environmental protection and investment in renewable energy. But ecosystems will only tolerate so much. “There’s no doubt we’re in for dramatic warming still,” he said. “We’re literally going into climatic spaces that are beyond the norm. With another degree, it’ll almost certainly be 100 percent of species affected. What we don’t know is how those species are going to react.”",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

Study Finds Cosmic Rays Increased Heart Risks Among Apollo Astronauts,"Apollo astronauts who ventured to the moon are at five times greater risk of dying from heart disease than shuttle astronauts, U.S. researchers said on Thursday, citing the dangers of cosmic radiation beyond the Earth’s magnetic field. The study by researchers at Florida State University and NASA found that three Apollo astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, or 43 percent of those studied, died from cardiovascular disease, a finding with implications for future human travel beyond Earth. The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, was the first to look at the mortality of Apollo astronauts, the only people so far to travel beyond a few hundred miles (km) of Earth. It found that the chief health threat to the Apollo astronauts came from cosmic rays, which are more prevalent and powerful beyond the magnetic bubble that surrounds Earth. NASA disputed the findings, saying it was too early to draw conclusions about the effect of cosmic rays on Apollo astronauts because the current data is limited. The results of the study have implications for the United States and other countries, as well as private companies, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which are planning missions to Mars and other destinations beyond Earth. For the study, the researchers examined the death records of 42 astronauts who flew in space, including seven Apollo veterans, and 35 astronauts who died without ever going into space. They found the Apollo astronauts’ mortality rate from cardiovascular disease was as much as five times higher than for astronauts who never flew, or for those who flew low-altitude missions aboard the space shuttle that orbited a few hundred miles above Earth. A companion study simulated weightlessness and radiation exposure in mice and showed that radiation exposure was far more threatening to the cardiovascular system than other factors, lead scientist Michael Delp said in an interview. “What the mouse data show is that deep space radiation is harmful to vascular health,” he said. So far, only 24 astronauts have flown beyond Earth’s protective magnetic shield, in missions spanning a four-year period from December 1968 to December 1972. Of those, eight have died, seven of whom were included in the study. The cause of death of the eighth astronaut, Apollo 14’s Edgar Mitchell, who died in February 2016, has not been released, so he was excluded from the study, Delp said. Mitchell was the sixth person to walk on the moon. Delp and colleagues are working on a follow-up study that includes more detail on family medical histories, smoking and other factors.

2 Companies Intervene To Block Their Drugs In 'Assembly Line' Arkansas Executions,"Two pharmaceutical companies are asking a federal judge to stop Arkansas from using their drugs in the planned execution of seven men in 11 days this month. The European-owned Fresenius Kabi USA and West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. filed a friend of the court brief in support of a lawsuit by inmates because they’re opposed to their drugs being used in capital punishment. “The use of the medicines in lethal injections runs counter to the manufacturers’ mission to save and enhance patients’ lives, and carries with it not only a public-health risk, but also reputational, fiscal and legal risks,” the companies said in their brief.  The drugs’ use in executions is a breach of the companies’ “supply chain” controls, argues the brief, which was filed Thursday. The manufacturers “sell only to wholesalers and distributers who agree to resell only to acute-care hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities,” and the drugs were never intended to be used in executions, it states. “The only conclusion is that these medicines were acquired from an unauthorized seller in violation of important contractual terms that the manufacturers relied on,” the companies added. In addition, using drugs for capital punishment “creates a public-health risk because it could result in the denial of medicines from patients who need them most,” the brief stated. Arkansas hasn’t executed anyone in more than a decade. Now officials plan to begin with a double execution on Monday and finish executions on April 27. (An eighth man, Jason McGehee, won a reprieve.) One defense attorney blasted the schedule as an “assembly line” execution, Reuters reported. The state is reportedly rushing to kill the men before its supply of the controversial sedative midazolam used in executions runs out at the end of April. The drug has been implicated in botched executions in Ohio, Arizona and Oklahoma. Arkansas officials won’t say where they obtained the drugs they intend to use, but Fresenius Kabi is suspected of manufacturing the potassium chloride — which stops the heart — planned for the executions. And The Associated Press reports that West-Ward is the likely source of the midazolam the state plans to use.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Earth's New Normal: Wild Weather 2014,"Each year in early January (2011, 2012, 2013) I have tallied a scorecard on the vicious effects of burning in excess of 85 million tons of carbon fuels daily on our planet. Irrespective of where you live the human-induced effects of global warming are irrefutable and deadly. 
The Waratah Coal Project is part of the expanding Galilee Basin in western Queensland that will bring Australia's coal export to whopping 240 million metric tons per annum -- a projected increase of five fold under Prime Minister Tony Abbott's new Coalition government.  As humans ramp-up the destruction of nature in Australia, Canada, Indonesia and elsewhere to feed the insatiable coal and petroleum markets in China, India and the U.S. the amount of melting ice at both poles continues to erode at an astounding rate. In the Northern Hemisphere less Arctic ice cover in September means that a warming Arctic Ocean is easily able to infuse its latent heat into the Arctic atmosphere. As this occurs an all-hell-break-loose scenario is felt elsewhere - particularly on the eastern half on the North American continent and in the U.K. 
A warming Arctic is loosing its ice cover quickly. The Arctic is warming at least two times faster than the rest of our planet. It's not just the loss of the white surface, which reflects solar radiation back to space and helps keep Earth at a habitable temperature range for our species that is a concern. A warming Arctic Ocean of 1.8 degrees (F) has caused the upper atmosphere to change, dramatically. The polar jet stream is a powerful upper atmosphere, sinuous river of air, which normally hugs the North Pole tightly, but since it has been super-charged with Arctic Ocean heat it's migrating with regularity - southward. A meandering polar jet stream spells epic wild weather. 
A meandering polar jet stream opens the deep-freezer door and pours frigid polar air onto the U.S. during the first week of January 2014. A massive winter blizzard on January 3, 2014 throughout the Northeast dumped feet of snow with Arctic air spilling bone-chilling temperatures across at least half of the United States. On the Northern Plains, including Iowa, Minnesota, Dakotas and eastern Montana the mercury has plummeted with wind chills reaching in excess of -50 degrees (F). 
The first blizzard of 2014 brought feet of snow across the Northeast and teeth-chattering temperatures across the Northern Plains. It is so cold that Sunday's Wildcard Playoff game at Green Bay's Lambeau Field may eclipse the January 2008 NFC Championship of -4 degrees (F) - as the coldest NFL game ever played. Meanwhile in Canada - no stranger to bitter winter temperatures - as the New Year began the eastern half of that nation was blanketed by frigid Arctic temperatures more reminiscent to those of outer space as record-breaking wind chills of in excess of -60 degrees (F) were recorded. In fact, in northern Manitoba on New Year's Eve (2013) the mercury touched -62 degrees (F) the same surface temperature as Mars; and by the way, the temperature in the North Pole that afternoon was -6 degrees (F). The meandering polar jet stream is wreaking havoc on the other side of the Atlantic in the U.K. where the Brits have been lashed and pummeled, again by walls of 30-foot waves in concert with king tides (the highest of the year) and colossal hailstones leaving a horrible wake of destruction including destroyed roads, rail lines and floods that with regularity are breaching the defenses. That destruction may be tame compared to the 50-foot waves predicted for Monday (January 6, 2014). 
The British coast was battered by 30-foot waves on January 1, 2014. In the Southern Hemisphere, Australia is broiling and enveloped by yet another drought fraught with bushfires. 2013 was their hottest year ever recorded. At 2 degrees (F) above the long-term average it easily surpassed 2005 as the hottest year. Every month in 2013 was 0.9 degree (F) above the normal dating back to the inception of continuous record keeping in 1910. Australia has experienced just one cooler than average year in the last decade -- 2011. 
Australia experienced the hottest spring on record and on January 2, 2014 South Australian temperature were in excess of 120 degrees (F). Temperatures of 120 degrees (F) occurred January 2, 2014 in South Australia whilst New South Wales is enduring its worst-ever drought. And in tropical Queensland a sweltering heat wave has temperatures there reaching 117 degrees (F). Elderly people with chronic illness, especially diabetes and obese people are at terrible risk. In addition, all pets left outside in these inferno-like temperatures stand little chance of survival. While most North American early January (2014) temperatures resemble the inside of deep freezer - California, on the other hand, is warm and bone-dry. A high-pressure system has stalled over the Eastern North Pacific Ocean diverting the moisture carried by the jet stream northward toward British Columbia and Alaska. As of January 1, 2014 California reached its driest mark since record keeping began in 1849. In Los Angeles where I live we average 14.93 inches of precipitation annually - this year we received 3.60 inches. San Francisco received a meager 3.38 inches of rainfall in 2013; its normal is 20.65 inches. 
A strong ridge has developed off the California coast preventing the storms carrying moisture that normally falls as snow onto the Sierra Nevada's, which supplies about 85% of the the water for the eighth mightiest economy on the globe. Currently 85 percent of California is experiencing a severe drought; this is very serious because without water the nations leading agricultural producer at $16 billion annually (including the world's largest almond crop at $3 billion, alone) is in dire straights. The drought is predicted to cost farmers at least $1 billion. 
Droughts are plaguing a warming world and livestock as well as vegetation have no chance of survival without the life blood of Earth -- fresh water.

California's reservoirs are at less than 40 percent capacity. The Sierra snowpack is running 23-34 percent while Oregon's Cascades are even lower between 18 and 22 percent. Californian forests are tinder-dry and without winter snowfall and the spring melt-waters to recharge soil moisture preparing the trees for a hot, dry summer we can expect hellacious firestorms later this year. 
When Californian forests are parched they burn during the normally dry summers, but this year (2014) without winter moisture the wildfires can begin early in the springtime. Clearly, the most precious substance on a warming Earth is its fresh water. Until we address our voracious addiction to coal and petroleum and allow innovation our best friend in the 21st century to guide us beyond the present crisis, we can expect more brutal wild weather with its massive price tag of devastation to continue.

Trump's Scottish Golf Resort Pays Women Significantly Less Than Men: Report,"President Donald Trump’s flagship Scottish golf resort in Turnberry pays its female employees less than men and has four times as many men as women in executive spots, according to an official filing with local authorities, The Scotsman reported. The mean rate for female pay at Trump Turnberry is 13.7 percent less than the pay for men, according to gender pay equality documents required by Scotland. So for every $1 men were paid, women got 86 cents. The average mean bonus paid to men was $4,414, which was nearly twice as much as the average bonus paid to women — $2,256 — in the 12 months to April 2017, the newspaper reported, citing the filings. Only seven women and 11 men were given bonuses. Turnberry management flatly attributed the pay gap to “male-dominated functions” at golf resorts, as well as the ”number of senior leadership roles undertaken by males” at Turnberry. Women fill 46.8 percent of the lowest paid jobs at the 800-acre resort, and just 31.2 percent of the highest paid positions, report added. The discrepancy emerged in what’s believed to be the first time pay rates and executive numbers have been revealed by any Trump business. Trump has owned the resort since 2014, and it’s run by his sons Eric and Donald Jr. Patrick Harvie, a member of the Scottish Parliament from the Green Party, told The Scotsman: “Trump is a sexist bully, so the fact that equal pay doesn’t seem to matter at his golf course should surprise no one.” The U.K. Equality Pay Act requires any company with more than 250 employees (Turnberry has 313) to file annual reports detailing gender pay rates. When Trump was running for president he insisted he had been “very, very good for women” and “way ahead of the curve” as an employer. His attorney Michael Cohen boasted that there were more female executives at the Trump Organization than men, but did not provide any evidence to substantiate that claim. Helping working women has been a major talking point for Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, but she supported her dad’s move last year to dismantle the Obama-era initiative bolstering equal pay. Similar to the requirement in the U.K., the initiative would have required private employers with 100 or more workers to submit pay data. Earlier this month, The Scotsman reported that the U.S. government paid $7,800 to the golf resort to cover expenses and security for unnamed VIP guests earlier this year. The resort last year got a $147,000 tax break from Scottish taxpayers. But the government has since jettisoned the property from the program that was intended to give struggling companies a break, the Sunday Herald reported. “It’s bad enough that he has a business presence in Scotland,” Harvie told the newspaper after the decision was made. “It’s galling to learn that the public purse is giving him a helping hand.”",POLITICS,BUSINESS

Hackers Used Your Vulnerable Tech To Throttle The Internet,"Hackers unleashed a complex attack on the internet through common devices like webcams and digital recorders and cut access to some of the world’s best known websites on Friday, a stunning breach of global internet stability. The attacks struck Twitter, Paypal, Spotify and other customers of an infrastructure company in New Hampshire called Dyn, which acts as a switchboard for internet traffic. The attackers used hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices that had previously been infected with a malicious code that allowed them to cause outages that began in the Eastern United States and then spread to other parts of the country and Europe. “At this point we know this was a sophisticated, highly distributed attack involving 10s of millions of IP addresses,” said Dyn’s chief strategy officer, Kyle York. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said they were investigating. The disruptions come at a time of unprecedented fears about the cyber threat in the United States, where hackers have breached political organizations and election agencies. Friday’s outages were intermittent and varied by geography. Users complained they could not reach dozens of internet destinations including Mashable, CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Yelp and some businesses hosted by Amazon.com Inc. Dyn said attacks were coming from millions of internet addresses, making it one of the largest attacks ever seen. Security experts said it was an especially potent type of distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, in which attackers flood the targets with so much junk traffic that they freeze up.  Dyn said that at least some of the malicious traffic was coming from connected devices, including webcams and digital video recorders, that had been infected with control software named Mirai. Security researchers have previously raised concerns that such connected devices, sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things, lack proper security. The Mirai code was dumped on the internet about a month ago, and criminal groups are now charging to employ it in cyber attacks, said Allison Nixon, director of security research at Flashpoint, which was helping Dyn analyze the attack. Dale Drew, chief security officer at communications provider Level 3, said that other networks of compromised machines were also used in Friday’s attack, suggesting that the perpetrator had rented access to several so-called botnets. The attackers took advantage of traffic-routing services such as those offered by Alphabet Inc’s Google and Cisco Systems Inc’s OpenDNS to make it difficult for Dyn to root out bad traffic without also interfering with legitimate inquiries, Drew said. “Dyn can’t simply block the (Internet Protocol) addresses they are seeing, because that would be blocking Google or OpenDNS,” said Matthew Prince, CEO of security and content delivery firm CloudFlare. “These are nasty attacks, some of the hardest to protect against.”   Drew and Nixon both said that the makers of connected devices needed to do far more to make sure that the gadgets can be updated after security flaws are discovered. Big businesses should also have multiple vendors for core services like routing internet traffic, and security experts said those Dyn customers with backup domain name service providers would have stayed reachable. The Department of Homeland Security last week issued a warning about attacks from the Internet of Things, following the release of the code for Mirai. Attacking a large domain name service provider like Dyn can create massive disruptions because such firms are responsible for forwarding large volumes of internet traffic. Dyn said it had resolved one morning attack, which disrupted operations for about two hours, but disclosed a second a few hours later that was causing further disruptions. By Friday evening it was fighting a third. Amazon’s web services division, one of the world’s biggest cloud computing companies, reported that the issue temporarily affected users in Western Europe. Twitter and some news sites could not be accessed by some users in London late on Friday evening. PayPal Holdings Inc said that the outage prevented some customers in “certain regions” from making payments. It apologized for the inconvenience and said that its networks had not been hacked. A month ago, security guru Bruce Schneier wrote that someone, probably a country, had been testing increasing levels of denial-of-service attacks against unnamed core internet infrastructure providers in what seemed like a test of capability. Nixon said there was no reason to think a national government was behind Friday’s assaults, but attacks carried out on a for-hire basis are famously difficult to attribute.   (Reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco, Jim Finkle in Boston and Dustin Volz in Washington.

Images Show That Saturn's North Polar Region Has Changed Color,"NASA researchers are trying to figure out why Saturn’s hexagonal north polar region has changed color over the past four years. Saturn’s hexagon is a six-sided jet stream barrier, according to scientists, who have proposed various theories to explain its shape. In one image NASA shared, from 2012, the hexagon appears to be bluish. But in another photo taken four years later, it looks golden. Saturn’s changing seasons and increased exposure to sunlight might have caused the color change, scientists theorize. “During the polar winter night between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn’s north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions ― reactions involving sunlight and the atmosphere,” NASA explained on its website. “Since the planet experienced equinox in August 2009, the polar atmosphere has been basking in continuous sunshine, and aerosols are being produced inside of the hexagon, around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy today,” the website stated. Atmospheric circulation could also explain the color change. Both images were obtained by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft, which launched in 1997 and orbits Saturn, studying the planet and its moons.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Top Interior Department Official In Email To Staff: 'Our Job Is To Protect The Secretary',"WASHINGTON — A high-ranking political appointee at the Department of the Interior told colleagues their job is ultimately to protect their boss, Secretary Ryan Zinke, internal emails reveal ― in particular from matters that could trigger an ethics probe or negative media attention.  In the March 28 email exchange, Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch brothers adviser whom Zinke appointed as his principal deputy solicitor, raised concerns over a $4,000 bill for a staffer’s six-day trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The staffer, Russell Roddy, was the agency’s director of scheduling and advance until he quit in January. Roddy had traveled to the Virgin Islands in preparation for a trip Zinke took in late March and early April.  The exchange, released as part of an open records request, occurred less than a month after Zinke took over the agency. It starts with a rather blunt email from Roddy explaining in detail why he needed to stay on the islands for nearly a week. “I may not be good at a lot of things,” he told Jorjani, “but one thing I know I am good at is efficiently planning and executing events and advance.” Roddy’s email paints a picture of a frustrated and overworked employee. In his note to Jorjani, Roddy said he was “in dire need of a vacation.” (Two months later, as Interior Department staff made last-minute travel arrangements to ensure Zinke’s wife could join him for a dinner in Anchorage with Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, Roddy wrote to several colleagues: “UGH! We have all kinds of planes, trains and automobiles manifests to now scramble with.”) Roddy left under unclear circumstances, Politico reported at the time. In his reply, Jorjani was understanding, writing “Rusty - Not your fault.” He cast blame on another staffer for failing to prepare the paperwork in advance of the trip. What seemed to worry Jorjani most was the possibility of an investigation by the agency’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and how such a probe could reflect on Zinke.  “$4,000 for a six day advance in the Virgin Islands is not a small sun [sic] and will draw the OIG’s attention. (OIG loves travel investigations. They are easy to document and spin in a negative way),” Jorjani wrote. Jorjani boasted that he had experience fending off such internal investigations, noting that he had “worked and successfully protected” Interior presidential appointments who had undergone investigations from the internal watchdog. Jorjani noted that approval was sought only after Roddy departed on the trip, and he stressed the importance of properly documenting travel. “Otherwise,” he wrote, “it will be easy for the OIG or the Washington Post to spin things negatively.”  “At the end of the day,” he added, “our job is to protect the Secretary.” Interior spokesperson Heather Swift said that the email “speaks for itself.” Jorjani did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.  The email provides a peek into Zinke’s inner circle, suggesting some appointees view their role as gatekeepers who must first and foremost protect the secretary against ethics scandals.  Jorjani previously held senior positions at the Charles Koch Foundation and Charles Koch Institute and most recently worked as general counsel at the Koch-supported Freedom Partners. A top legal operative at Zinke’s Interior Department, Jorjani’s calendar shows he met extensively and communicated with industry lobbyists, trade groups and corporate executives.  In December, he was involved in rolling back several Obama-era regulations, including authoring an interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act that protects energy companies and other parties from being prosecuted for unintentionally killing birds. The oil and gas industry praised the decision. Jorjani also decided to renew controversial leases for the Twin Metals copper and nickel mine in Minnesota following a lobbying blitz by the leaseholder, Chilean company Antofagasta, Plc. Zinke and his team have faced mounting criticism over their spending, travel and apparent conflicts of interest. The inspector general investigated Zinke’s use of private planes at taxpayers’ expense — a controversy the secretary shrugged off as “a little BS” — and concluded that he ”generally followed relevant law, policy, rules, and regulations.”  Among the trips that have been heavily scrutinized was his 2017 visit to the U.S. Virgin Islands for the 100th anniversary of the transition of power from Denmark ― the trip Jorjani was worried about Roddy spending so much time and money planning. While there, Zinke flew on chartered planes, at a price of $3,150, and attended a Republican fundraising event ― one of several instances that have earned him accusations of mixing work with politics.",POLITICS,POLITICS

Meet The Woman Who Launched A New Field Of Scientific Study,"As a female chemical engineer, Frances Arnold was already a rarity. After all, only about 16 percent of chemical engineers are women. But now that she has become the first woman ever to win the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize — it was awarded in Helsinki, Finland, on May 24 — Arnold is truly one of a kind. And she knows that in addition to a big cash award (1 million euros, or about $1.3 million), the prize brings an opportunity to spotlight the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers and to be a role model for other women. ""I hope that my getting this prize will highlight the fact that yes, women can do this, they can do it well, and that they can make a contribution to the world and be recognized for it,"" Arnold told The Huffington Post in an email. ""I hope that women will see that one can have a rewarding career in science and technology."" Arnold, 59, won the prize for ""her discoveries that launched a field known as directed evolution,"" according to a statement issued by Technology Academy Finland, the organization that awards the prize. To learn more about the field, and about Arnold herself, HuffPost Science posed a series of questions to her via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers: Did you always want to be a scientist? I did not choose to become a researcher until I was almost 30. I tried other careers, but science spoke to me more and more, especially after I started studying the biological world and all the amazing molecular machines made by nature. As a little girl, I thought I might be a heart surgeon, CEO of a multinational company or even a diplomat some day (until I figured out I had no diplomatic skills). When I went to college, I never really thought about being a scientist or an engineer, but of course that was always on the list of possibilities. I had tried lots of odd jobs — from taxi driver to waitress to assembling electronic devices — and later a few science and technology jobs in nuclear power and solar energy. But I loved languages, I enjoyed economics, I spent every break traveling and seeing different cultures. I loved learning and did not think too much about the future until one day it happened! Why do women continue to be underrepresented in engineering and other STEM fields? Because talented women choose to do other things. But if they knew how important technology is for supporting our well-being and that of the planet, and how fun it can be, more would choose STEM fields. What barriers keep women from choosing STEM careers? I believe that some women still face external barriers, but other barriers are more self-imposed: lack of confidence or desire to compete and a misunderstanding of what science and technology can contribute to society. Science is not for everyone; it takes a lot of time and devotion to become really good, and the same is true for engineering. You have to love it. What I see is that the most talented women have many opportunities. Whether they choose to pursue science or engineering depends on how they feel about their whole life experience, perhaps more so than men. Opportunities today are excellent, but there are challenges to having a family and competing at the highest levels that women often feel more acutely. What can be done to eliminate these barriers? At the very least, girls should not be discouraged from using their natural talents in mathematics and science. Even better, they should be encouraged and praised. What's a typical workday like for you? Rich, never boring, something new and interesting every day. Full of brilliant young people who want to change the world. So now about your research -- what is directed evolution? It's a technology that allows us to reliably create improved proteins for a wide range of applications. Just as farmers and breeders have used artificial selection processes over thousands of years to create higher-yielding crops or pets that please us, we can direct the evolution of proteins to perform better in applications, from laundry detergents to green chemistry. Modern methods of DNA manipulation allow us to make iterations of mutations and artificial selection on a gene rather than in an organism, and to shorten the generation time to a few days. That way we can accumulate beneficial mutations in the gene that encodes the protein, making it better and better until it meets our needs. What makes proteins so important? Proteins are the workhorses of life, responsible for nearly all the interesting things we and other organisms can do. Just one (very important) class of proteins, the enzymes are responsible for turning food (for example, for some microbes this means sunlight, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc.) into all the materials and energy needed to support life and reproduce life. That’s pretty amazing chemistry, and we should learn how to harness that for our own purposes. We have already been using microbes and the enzymes in them to improve our lives for thousands of years, from making bread, beer, wine, cheese -- to, more recently, having laundry detergents that take stains off of clothes in cold water (thus saving significant energy), making fuels and chemicals from renewable resources or making drugs to treat diabetes. How does directed evolution differ from evolution as we commonly think of it? It differs from natural evolution in that it is directed by the researcher. Mutations are directed (by me) to a specific gene, and since the researcher has a goal in mind, it is also directed in that sense.  How is directed evolution being used commercially? Directed evolution has had big impact in the fields of drug synthesis. Many popular drugs, including the cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and atorvastatin, have been developed with the help of directed evolution. The same is true for making consumer products (key ingredients for creams, laundry detergents, animal and human nutrition products and many more) and for making non-ethanol fuels like isobutanol from renewable plant resources. What are the biggest advances that have come from the commercial application of directed evolution? My former student and one of the first people to use directed evolution, Dr. Jeffrey Moore, and his collaborators figured out how to manufacture the diabetes drug Januvia using an evolved enzyme. Their process replaces chemical methods that were far from optimal, lowering the cost of the drug and especially the waste products. Their process won many awards, including the President's Green Chemistry Challenge. Many companies now incorporate enzyme catalysts into their processes. More will do so as we move to greater sustainability in manufacturing. A number of companies that make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources have used DE to optimize enzymes. Enzymes optimized by directed evolution are being used to make nutritional products for humans and animals, fuel from biomass and to test new drugs for toxicity. They are being used directly to treat human disease. Engineered enzymes are used in everything from DNA sequencing to glucose sensors for diabetes, laundry detergents and food processing. What do you foresee for directed evolution in the future? The wonderful thing about directed evolution is that it is both simple and general. Because the technology is accessible, it can be implemented in any laboratory. It opened up a new way for people to look at the inventions of the biological world and fit them into their own creations. So many clever people all over the world have taken this technology and done all manner of brilliant things with it, things I would never have thought of. This will continue in the future.  What are you going to do with all that prize money? I will use some of it to invest in work done at Provivi, a startup I cofounded with two of my former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho. Provivi is developing the non-toxic alternatives to pesticides, which I think is such an important goal. Why so important? Pesticides get into our food, streams and rivers and cause all manner of harm. Imagine spraying a little bit of ""perfume"" in a field to confuse the insect pests so that they can't mate. If they can't mate they are not going to damage your crops. Wouldn't it be wonderful to do that instead of dumping highly toxic pesticides? Our hope is to make these complicated insect perfumes quite cheaply using enzymes. Is there a particular scientific question you're trying to answer? I am very interested in the evolution of novelty — how do new functions appear in the biological world. I am tackling this question by evolving enzyme catalysts that catalyze chemical reactions not known in the biological world.",SCIENCE,TECH
Smear Campaign Against Michigan Candidate Shows How Hard It Is For Muslims To Run For Office,"The Michigan gubernatorial race took an ugly turn last week, when a Republican contender accused a Democratic candidate of being part of a “civilizational jihad” to take over America.  The Republican, state Sen. Patrick Colbeck, stands by his accusation that former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Just one of Colbeck’s Republican rivals condemned the remarks; Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a Colbeck backer, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. What El-Sayed is going through happens to nearly every Muslim-American in public life: They face baseless questions about their patriotism and then are left in a no-win situation. If they deny the charges, they risk giving them credence. But if they ignore them, they might get even more traction.  “We have to spend the bulk of our time disproving negatives: ‘Prove that you’re not a radical Islamist. Prove that you’re not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Prove that you’re not trying to implement Sharia,’” said Wajahat Ali, a Muslim-American writer and co-author of “Fear Inc.,” a 2011 study of networks of anti-Muslim bigotry.  It’s a phenomenon that Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim-American civil rights group, calls a “type of neo-McCarthyism.” If elected, El-Sayed, a 33-year-old physician, would be the country’s first Muslim governor. And there is no evidence that he has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. But thanks to Colbeck and the amplification he received on conservative talk radio, the allegations already show signs of staying power. El-Sayed graduated with honors from the University of Michigan, where his classmates and teachers picked him to deliver the 2007 commencement speech. The remarks, peppered with inside-campus jokes, showcased an early flair for public speaking. He was also vice president of the Muslim Students Association, which Colbeck believes shows El-Sayed has sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood. Of course, just because they both have the word “Muslim” in them doesn’t mean they’re the same.  The MSA, as it is commonly known, functions as a gathering place for campus Muslims ― not unlike the Hillel chapters that serve as hubs for Jewish students. The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an international Islamist group that varies by country, but generally seeks to enact public policies based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law (often through the democratic process). Although it is true that the Muslim immigrants who founded the first MSA chapter in 1963 were sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, today’s MSA chapters are not associated with the group or its philosophy. Colbeck has also pointed to El-Sayed’s support for other things and people that happen to have ties to the Islamic faith, including progressive Muslim activist Linda Sarsour, and the fact that El-Sayed’s father-in-law once led the Michigan chapter of the Council for American-Islamic Relations. In Colbeck’s book, these ties are more proof that he has “strong connections to individuals and groups that are not loyal to the United States.”   El-Sayed’s gubernatorial campaign has refused to dignify Colbeck’s line of inquiry with a direct denial on every occasion it arises. Instead, it has referred reporters to an August profile of El-Sayed in The Guardian, in which El-Sayed flatly denies that he is part of a Muslim Brotherhood plot or other conspiracies to implement Sharia law. He also declared himself a firm believer in the separation of church and state ― a worldview already apparent in his support for abortion rights and LGBTQ protections. Still, Colbeck’s conspiracy theory has spread thanks to media figures like conservative drive-time radio host Frank Beckmann, who interviewed Colbeck and demanded a response to his claims from the El-Sayed campaign, as if they were simply on two different sides of a subjective policy debate. El-Sayed campaign spokesman Adam Joseph declined an immediate request for El-Sayed to be interviewed by Beckmann, who has a history of racially insensitive comments. In response, Beckmann accused Joseph of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood as well. “If you support the Muslim Brotherhood, just come right out and say so, Adam,” Beckmann said during his Friday morning broadcast. “Your candidate supports the Muslim Brotherhood, come right out and say it, we’re happy to put that on the air too, OK?”    The recurring insinuation is potentially harmful because it appears to bolster many Michigan Democrats’ privately-held views that El-Sayed’s Islamic faith makes him unelectable this November. Those fears prompted Democrats to start a whisper campaign in late January questioning his ballot eligibility, according to El-Sayed and his allies. El-Sayed has sought to disprove skeptics with a laser focus on progressive policy priorities like enacting state-level single-payer health care, legalizing marijuana and launching a green transformation of the state’s infrastructure. “Michiganders are less concerned about how I pray. They care more about what I pray for ― my family, my community, my state, and my country (and, of course, University of Michigan football),” El-Sayed said in a statement. El-Sayed trails former state Senate Democratic leader Gretchen Whitmer and businessman Shri Thanedar in an April poll, though he just went on the air with his first television ad. The primary is on August 7. Michigan is home to one of the country’s largest and most influential Muslim communities. But even here, anti-Muslim bigotry makes its way into campaigns. In 2012, Syed Taj, a Democratic candidate for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, was the target of ads claiming that he would use his power in Congress to impose Islamic law on Americans. Taj went on to lose his race to Republican Kerry Bentivolio by 6 percentage points. State Rep. Abdullah Hammoud, a Democrat from Dearborn and the only Muslim in Michigan’s state legislature, recalled receiving campaign mailers torn up by their recipients and returned to his campaign offices with threats about Muslims. Hammoud claims that he has since won over some skeptical white residents of his majority-Arab-American district through his focus on constituent services and championing causes with universal appeal. However, the election of President Donald Trump makes the job of candidates like El-Sayed and elected officials like Hammoud that much harder. “It has become mainstreamed because this type of popular anti-Muslim bigotry and talking points are not being spouted off from the gutter margins of the internet but from the White House itself,” Ali concluded.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Apple Hit With Lawsuits After Admitting It Intentionally Slowed Down iPhones,"Apple is facing several lawsuits after the tech giant admitted this week that it was deliberately slowing down the performance of its older iPhones. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said slowing down the phones via a recent software update was necessary because the aging batteries in older phones were causing devices to unexpectedly shut down.  Understandably, iPhone users were pissed. Apple’s statement on iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE power management (the slowdown): pic.twitter.com/3RpE3fKCQc If Apple is going to slow down an old phone so the battery can handle it, you should receive several alerts about it. They're coercing people to buy something new, even if they want to pretend that isn't their intention. Apple said they slow down old iPhones to improve performance pic.twitter.com/dCz7XNUKJE Many iPhone users didn’t buy Apple’s excuse. Some insisted the company was purposely slowing down older phone models as a way of forcing consumers to purchase the newer iPhone models. Two different class-action lawsuits were filed in California and Illinois on Thursday alleging just that. In a federal suit filed in Chicago, five customers claim Apple is engaging in “deceptive, immoral and unethical” practices in violation of consumer protection laws, the Chicago Sun Times reported. “Corporations have to realize that people are sophisticated and that when people spend their hard-earned dollars on a product they expect it to perform as expected,” James Vlahakis, the attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Chicago suit, told the Sun Times. “Instead, Apple appears to have obscured and concealed why older phones were slowing down.” In the California lawsuit, two law school students at the University of Southern California argue Apple installed the performance-stifling update without the device owner’s permission, the Mercury News reported.  The students, Stefan Bogdanovich and Dakota Speas, also claim Apple “intentionally interfered” with consumers’ iPhones, forcing users to “have to replace iPhones, buy new batteries,” or lose “usage of their phone,” according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CBS News. Apple “breached the implied contracts it made with Plaintiffs and Class Members by purposefully slowing down older iPhone models when new models come out and by failing to properly disclose that at the time of that the parties entered into an agreement,” the suit reads. Apple has not publicly responded to the lawsuits. For years, we’ve reassured people that no, Apple doesn’t secretly slow down their older iPhones to make them buy new ones.If this must be done, it should be a setting. If it’s on by default, the user should be alerted the first time it happens.https://t.co/kRRmd7mN72 Apple does display a little notice deep in settings to let iPhone users know their batteries are bad pic.twitter.com/OgeO57VfTm While some people have pointed out the company does offer its users a hard-to-find notice that alerts them when their iPhone’s battery needs servicing, many claim the company could have been more transparent about its strategies. The New York Times’ Niraj Chokshi writes: [Apple] could have avoided controversy by being more transparent to begin with. It could have notified people that a power management mode was kicking in to keep their iPhones running for longer because their batteries are running out of juice. That would also inform people that they should be getting their batteries replaced. Because Apple was not transparent, it’s natural for people to suspect it of deliberately crippling their devices to get them to buy new ones.",BUSINESS,TECH
Garry Kasparov: Donald Trump Has More Russian Connections Than Aeroflot,"Legendary chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov delivered a one-two punch Monday against Russian President Vladimir Putin — and Donald Trump — as he warned of the very serious threat to American democracy that the Kremlin “dictator” continues to pose to America. “Trump has more Russian connections than Aeroflot,” Kasparov said, referring to the Russian airline in a speech Monday at the Common Good Forum in New York. “I believe in coincidences, but I also believe in the KGB.” The Russian dissident and human rights activist also accused Trump on MSNBC Monday of “trying to divert” the investigation of Russian interference into the U.S. presidential election to “minor details.” Trump’s “attempts to move away from the core of this investigation into some foolish stories just demonstrates that he is quite desperate, and that he wants to control this process by tweeting and by shouting,” Kasparov added. Trump’s new fury has been directed at his latest claim that the FBI planted a mole in his campaign, and he ordered the Justice Department to investigate. Last year, he claimed that the Obama administration had ordered the FBI to wiretap meetings in Trump Tower. There is no evidence that happened. Trump is more outraged about the FBI investigating Russian interference in his campaign & the election than he is about the interference. Personal interest over national security. https://t.co/QTaD0WQDPv Kasparov suspects that serious secrets about Putin and Trump’s relationship have yet to emerge. It’s suspicious, said Kasparov, that while Trump is “not shy of criticizing anybody or anything, from NATO to Meryl Streep, [he] always refrains from saying one negative word about Vladimir Putin.” Trump has criticized: Republicans, Democrats, the Pope, US elections, CIA, FBI, NATO, Meryl Streep.Trump hasn't criticized: Vladimir Putin. Kasparov said at the Common Good Forum that he warned years ago — and will continue to do so — that Russia would try to interfere in elections. “Putin will attack again, here and elsewhere,” said Kasparov, who pointed out that Putin and his operatives are masters at disinformation. America’s experience now with incendiary fake news campaigns is “nothing new for us in Russia,” he said, according to Yahoo News. He underscored his belief that Putin is “a dictator,” and Russia’s leaders and oligarchs are corrupt. “Every country has its own mafia,” he said. “In Russia, the mafia has its own country.” He said Americans can only defend themselves against a Kremlin onslaught if they fight for values they believe in, like truth and democracy. “You can’t defend yourself against Putin and the Putins of this world if you don’t believe what they are attacking is worth defending,” he warned.",POLITICS,SPORTS
We've Been Trying To Make Cities Walkable For Years. 'Pokemon Go' Did It Overnight.,"The streets, parks and sprawling strip malls of America’s cities and suburbs have become infested with a new urban species: the “Pokemon Go” player. Ambling about with phones held aloft, these specimens have their eyes glued to their screens, seemingly incapable of viewing their surroundings. Their unpredictable roaming has brought chaos and scorn, and they’ve walked into ponds and police stations, off a cliff and into criminals’ traps. I should know: I’m one of them, and I can’t help but get excited about the way this game ― often on the fritz and causing all sorts of trouble in the real world ― is breathing life into overlooked public spaces. Millions of people are playing Nintendo’s augmented reality app, where you hunt for Pokemon as your on-screen character mirrors your real-world movements on a map.  As they play, human “trainers” wander around neighborhoods to search for the cartoon creatures, meeting other players by chance in public parks and gathering “Poke balls” at local historic and cultural landmarks. They’re going on long walks they’d never take otherwise, and adventuring into new parts of their cities.  That’s not all that remarkable, but it’s a total reversal from the way most Americans typically get around. For decades, cities have made accommodations for cars at the expense of walking, biking and public transit, creating streets where walking feels unsafe, unappealing or impractical. There are obvious exceptions, like New York City, and Portland, Oregon, and officials have begun to take note of the economic, health and environmental value of walkable cities. But even if many people want to walk, most don’t.  More than 80 percent of all daily trips in the U.S. were taken by car in 2010, and only 13 percent of kids walked to elementary school and middle school in 2009, compared with 48 percent in 1969. But what urban planners and forward-thinking mayors have struggled to accomplish with development or pedestrian-safety infrastructure, Nintendo seems to have done for thousands of places and millions of people in just a few days ― even if it doesn’t last. John Conley, a 24-year-old gamer who uses the handle Apex Gaming, lives in Houston, and regularly drives to nature areas outside city limits to walk recreationally with his girlfriend. Since they started playing “Pokemon Go,” however, they’ve explored Houston on foot, checking out more than a dozen parks and neighborhoods they’d never seen.  A few days ago, Conley noticed the “Pokemon Go” effect at a small park with a pond and trail that he passes daily on his commute. “To see it empty all the time, I would just think, ‘Oh man, it’s such a shame it’s not being put to use,’” he said. “But now it’s full of people.” The app’s users are reclaiming public spaces for informal play, said Daniel Latorre, senior fellow of digital placemaking at the nonprofit Project for Public Spaces. “Pokemon Go” gives people opportunities to walk around and have spontaneous encounters and social interactions, which can be one of the best parts of urban life.  “The reason why people in New York, or Paris, or other highly walkable cities, walk a lot is because they’re dense, and there’s a lot of things to do and the public space is quite lively,” Latorre said.  With Pokemon ― and people chasing them ― popping up unexpectedly on the landscape, even the most homogenous suburban cul-de-sac may offer a mini-digital dose of the excitement found strolling down a Parisian street. Walked to the strip mall by my house and had brief convos with 4 complete strangers...two things that don't happen very often #PokemonGO ”’Pokemon Go’ is this sort of, seemingly overnight activation of public space,” Latorre said. “One of the lessons that can be drawn from this is, well, wouldn’t it be great if some of these activated spaces that I’m sure are empty lots or boring parks … had more variety for play or social gathering spaces.” Of course, many “Pokemon Go” users are drawn to the game for the nostalgia and the novelty ― not the walking ― and people have figured out hacks to play without moving, or they play while they drive, which is as dangerous as it sounds. So, when the novelty wears off, players may retreat back into their homes and cars.  For some, the game is fearful, not playful. Women have been bombarded by unwanted attention from male players who feel emboldened to pester them because they’re both looking for Pokemon, writes Slate’s Laura Hudson. Bystanders who aren’t familiar with the game have called the police about “suspicious,” loitering players. Omari Akil writes that as a black man, he worries about being viewed as a threat and shot in a police encounter. For him, playing feels like putting his life in danger.  But the fact that a group of kids prompts neighbors to call the police says a lot more about our low regard for public space ― we think it’s weird when people use it ― than it does about the game. “Pokemon Go” makes you aware of some of the obstacles to having safe, enjoyable public space for everybody, whether by leading you to a Pokestop at an abandoned building, or making you navigate around a freeway interchange as a pedestrian.  The game has also caused players to wear out their welcome in public space, nearly taking over a tiny Australian suburb with huge crowds and playing at sacred sites like the 9/11 Memorial. Those and other disruptions have prompted frustrations with the game’s design as well as with those who are playing. Teens in New Britain, Connecticut, have played the game at a local cemetery, a park after it closes for the night and a local World War II memorial. Mayor Erin Stewart (R) isn’t worried about it. “While some people view it as kind of disrespecting the war memorial ... this could be a good thing, because these kids would never visit this memorial otherwise,” Stewart said.  The 29-year-old mayor got into the first Pokemon craze as a kid and has spent some time playing the new game. When the game caught on, Stewart and a friend saw an opportunity to sell their town and made maps of local “Pokemon Go” destinations, which proved popular with residents.  “The young people in our community are getting out, they’re getting off the couch and out of their houses and walking around town,” Stewart said, as three “Pokemon Go” players walked past her window. “They’re discovering a lot of new things that the city has, that they’ve never seen before.”",TECH,TECH
UN Climate Talks May Only Bring Moderate Progress As Rich Nations Worry About Economy,"By Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle WARSAW, Nov 11 (Reuters) - World governments meeting in  Poland from Monday are likely to make only modest progress in  reaching a 2015 deal to fight climate change, with concern over  economic growth at least partially eclipsing scientists'  warnings of rising temperatures. ""We can't expect a grand agreement that solves the problems  in one fell swoop,"" said Elliot Diringer, executive director of  the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a U.S. think-tank. The best hope, he said, was for a 2015 accord in which  countries would agree limits on emissions of greenhouse gases  with a mechanism to compare and strengthen them over time. The outline of a deal, to be discussed by negotiators in  Warsaw from Nov. 11-22, is emerging that will not halt a  creeping rise in temperatures but might be a guide for tougher  measures in later years. Environmentalists warned about the dangers of delaying  action to avert more floods, heatwaves and rising sea levels. They point to super typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than  10,000 people in the Philippines last week, as a reminder of the  risks of extreme weather. A U.N. scientific  panel says cyclones may become more intense in some regions by  2100 as the planet warms. Global average temperatures have risen by 0.8 degrees  Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution and are  set to exceed 2C - a target ceiling agreed at a previous U.N.  summit - on current trends, despite a hiatus in the pace of  warming so far this century. In September, the U.N. panel of climate experts raised the  probability that mankind is the main cause of recent warming to  95 percent or ""extremely likely"" from 90 percent ""very likely"". The World Meteorological Organisation said this month  atmospheric volumes of greenhouse gases reached a new record in  2012, driven up by growth in emerging economies led by China.                 $100 BILLION AID Developed nations are putting most emphasis on spurring  economic growth after the financial crisis, rather than making  big investments in renewable energies such as wind or solar  power. Economic slowdown has - at least temporarily - cut  greenhouse gas emissions in many nations. The U.S. shale boom helped push U.S. carbon emissions to an  18-year low last year, but also shifted cheap, polluting coal  into Europe where it is used in power stations. Many governments, especially in Europe, are concerned  climate policies, such as generous support for renewables, push  up energy bills for consumers, a major political issue in  countries such as Britain. The Warsaw meeting will also seek ways to raise aid to help  developing nations cope with climate change. They have been  promised $100 billion a year by 2020, from $10 billion a year  from 2010-12. On Monday, aid charity Oxfam estimated that climate aid  totalled between $7.6 billion and $16.3 billion in 2013, but  said ""murky accounting and a lack of transparency by rich  countries"" made it hard to know. Christiana Figueres, the U.N. climate chief, said Warsaw was  a ""pivotal moment"" when it was still possible to limit rising  temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial times. ""Global  greenhouse gas emissions need to peak this decade,"" she said. Hosts Poland said a climate deal should allow countries to  define their own emissions targets - from power plants,  factories and cars - rather than try to impose them in a global  diktat. ""We need flexibility between the countries, that they will  promote their own strategies, their own goals,"" Environment  Minister Marcin Korolec said. Poland uses coal to generate 90 percent of its electricity  and has upset some delegates by planning a ""world coal summit""  about how to cut emissions from coal during the climate talks. Environmental group Greenpeace projected messages on six  Polish coal-fired power plants on Sunday saying: ""Climate change  starts here!"" and ""Storms start here!"".

This Is What Inspired Elon Musk To Get Into The Modern Space Race,"This adapted excerpt is taken from a new book, How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight, by Julian Guthrie, with a foreword by Richard Branson and an afterword by Stephen Hawking. (Penguin Press, Sept. 20, 2016) The new book tells the story of entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, his idea for a $10 million space prize, and the group of dreamers, engineers, rocket enthusiasts and aviation designers from across the globe who entered the race to become the first team to privately build and fly a rocket to the  start of space.  June 2001 Peter Diamandis arrived at the Skybar, a rooftop watering hole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, with the idea of meeting two young guys who had struck it rich in the dot com boom. Peter, whose lifelong dream had been to get man and machine to space without the government’s help, had heard these Internet entrepreneurs were interested in space.  Peter had never heard of the men before the meeting was arranged by a mutual friend, so he wrote down their names: Adeo Ressi and Elon Musk. Peter usually approached pitch meetings with great enthusiasm, but tonight he felt subdued. He spotted Adeo by the Skybar pool, smoking a cigarette and looking out at the gold and glimmering Los Angeles sunset. He was tall and thin, a Giacometti walking man figure, and immediately affable. Adeo said Elon was running late but on his way. Elon was working on getting his pilot’s license and was flying down from San Jose with his instructor. He had a new plane being built. It was Sunday, June 3, 2001, and Adeo, Elon, and Peter were scheduled to have dinner at Asia de Cuba, adjacent to the Skybar in the Mondrian Hotel. Peter took in the beautiful women in filmy tops and short skirts, and felt overdressed in his suit and mock turtleneck. Adeo was in casual slacks and a shirt open at the collar. The music was pulsating, the lychee up martinis flowing, and the entire hotel was bathed in white, with minimalist accents of Hermès orange. Even the matches were stylish, with lime-green tips. Peter had taken notice of the white-clad valet team when he pulled up to the white-façade hotel. The valet attendants all clasped their hands in exactly the same way. Peter joined Adeo for a drink near the pool. Adeo had just sold his Web development firm Methodfive and was working on turnarounds of lagging public companies. He said he and Elon had been housemates at the University of Pennsylvania. Elon was South African and had founded Zip2, a mapping and business services company, and cofounded PayPal, the online payment service being bought by eBay.  Their shared interest in space came to light during a late-night car ride the weekend before Memorial Day. As they drove back to New York City from Long Island on a cloudy night, talk turned to what they wanted to do next. As a joke, one of them said, “Why don’t we do something in space?” When the laughter died down, Elon said, “Well, why can’t we do something in space?” The debate went back and forth: Space was too expensive. Why was it so expensive? Space takes a lot of infrastructure. Why does it take so much infrastructure? Space is controlled by governments and strict regulation. What happens if it is taken out of the government’s hands? Finally, they asked each other, Why do we even think space is interesting? This led to a discussion of where they would go if they could go to space. By the end of the car ride, they had their answer about what to do next. They knew exactly where they wanted to go.  Before Adeo could continue, Elon arrived and apologized for being late. The three men moved with drinks in hand from the Skybar to the restaurant and ordered a feast: pan-seared ahi tuna, miso grilled salmon, the Asian noodle box, and more. Tracks from the Buddha Bar collection played in the background. Peter found Elon immediately likable: good chemistry from the start, soft-spoken, polite, his words well chosen. Adeo was also great, but more of an extrovert who seemed to enjoy playing devil’s advocate. Peter knew very little about the two coming into the night’s dinner. He’d had a quick conference call the week before with Elon and Adeo, thought they said all the right things, and took Elon’s accent to be British. Adeo made Peter laugh knowingly when he said, “I think every geek is a bit of a space buff.” Peter talked about his various space ventures, including the XPRIZE, which he had launched five years earlier to try to jumpstart the private space industry by offering a $10 million prize for the first team that could build and fly a rocket to the start of space. Peter also talked about Space Adventures, his company with Eric Anderson, which had brokered the final part of the deal to send the world’s first space tourist, Dennis Tito, to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft for $20 million. Peter talked briefly about how NASA had tried to stop Tito from flying, but Tito had launched on April 28 and landed safely in Kazakhstan on May 6. It was big news in space circles that Tito, an American, had to fly with Russian cosmonauts and was not allowed on the U.S. side of the space station.  As Peter talked about what the “ultimate space company” would look like, putting on Moon missions and suborbital and ZERO‑G flights, Elon and Adeo said they had set their sights on something different, something even more difficult. They wanted to reach the Red Planet. Their mission, decided that night on Long Island, was to put humanity on Mars. They wanted to spend money to “shame, embarrass, or prod” the government into doing a human mission to Mars. Peter cautioned that he had seen a lot of great missions fail because one wealthy backer or another expected other wealthy individuals to support his vision. “But every wealthy person has his own vision,” Peter said. To make such a mission work, Peter now believed, one very wealthy and determined person would need to be willing to pay for everything, something he had yet to encounter. As Elon listened to Peter talk about Blastoff and his other companies, he thought Peter’s heart was in the right place, and it was obvious that he cared deeply about the future of space travel. But the Blastoff plan didn’t make sense to him. He didn’t think sending a rover back to the Moon was going to reignite space travel. Returning to the subject of Mars, Elon said, “We want to do something that’s significant enough but does something for a reasonable budget—for a couple million.” Adeo added that they had $10 million to $15 million to spend, but wanted to start with a $1 million or $2 million project. Peter was stunned to hear such a low figure of “a couple million,” but knew that in aerospace, a couple million often led to many more millions. He listened to them with interest, but made sure not to get his hopes up. Still, at the very least, even if Elon and Adeo did nothing, Peter had met some smart guys who would be friends. Elon was a major Trekkie. He had watched all of the episodes as a kid in South Africa, dreamed of spaceships, and read Heinlein, Asimov, and Douglas Adams. He said his successes in Silicon Valley had paved the way for his future in space—not unlike what Jeff Bezos had told him. Adeo, Elon, and Peter shared an interest in using small teams to accomplish what only the government had done before, though Elon remarked that he saw the government as “a corporation—the biggest corporation.” And like Peter, Adeo and Elon didn’t see NASA as the bad guy, but instead saw the public’s expectation of perfection as an unnecessary speed limit on innovation. The expectation that everything needed to go right caused NASA to be overly cautious.  Elon talked about how he had been trying to understand why the world had not made more progress in sending people to the Moon or Mars. “There was a lot of excitement with the Apollo program and the dream of space travel,” Elon said. “It was ignited, and somehow that dream died or was put into stasis.” He said he was “trying to figure out if there is anything we can do to bring back the dream of Apollo. Maybe even a philanthropic mission.”  Peter could see that Elon—a logician and engineer above all else—needed to understand the physical and psychological limitations of why rockets hadn’t improved since the sixties. Peter knew that Elon and Adeo were in research mode, talking to a mix of major players and fringe players in the world of aerospace. Peter told them he thought Mars was a great place to set up a future colony, but “the Moon was economical. The Moon is a place where you can go to gain access to resources and you are close enough to Earth that you can build on it.” But Elon was not interested in the Moon. “Maybe we do a mini greenhouse to Mars,” he said. “Maybe mice to Mars. Maybe we grow samples of food crops.” He said it had been obvious to him since childhood, when the Moon was already reached, that “Mars is next.” Also, Mars was even more mythical, more unattainable. The Moon was 240,000 miles away from Earth. Mars was about 34 million miles away when their orbits were together on the same side of the sun, but as much as 250 million miles apart when the two planets were on the opposite sides of the sun. The Moon was the talcum face in the night sky. Mars was the out‑of‑reach gem. Mars would take at least half a year to reach, using optimal energy cost. It would take a year and a half for the planets to realign, and then it would take another six months to return. Elon said he thought such a mission sounded entirely doable. Earlier, in May, Elon had attended a Mars Society event with Jim Cameron, who was working on a six-episode TV miniseries on the Red Planet. Over breakfast the next morning with Mars Society cofounder Robert Zubrin, Elon had pledged $100,000 to the cause. Peter, who had been in constant pitching mode for what felt like an eternity, tried to sit back and listen, but he kept finding himself back in the mode of selling. Elon and Adeo asked whether a manned mission to Mars was possible for less than $10 billion. Now the budget is edging closer to reality, Peter thought. Peter said enticingly, “I’ve got a way for you to do it for a tenth of the cost, for one billion.” Everyone leaned in. “You could build a one-way mission with existing Russian hardware. You send a few people with the goal of their living on Mars for five years until a resupply or rescue mission gets there. They will be the world’s first Martians.” Adeo and Elon loved the idea and spent the next hour in a fast-paced discussion, going over details and obstacles. Peter then told them that whatever they did in space, they needed to first prove themselves, “step by step.” Even though Peter had figured out quickly that Elon and Adeo had no interest in funding one of his for-profit ventures, he admired how these guys were willing to gamble on space. And the evening offered a pleasant surprise: Elon loved the XPRIZE idea. “I could be a supporter of that,” he said. Elon thought that the XPRIZE could jump-start an industry and rekindle public interest in space.  Elon and Adeo appeared keenly interested as Peter talked about the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh, and the teams that had signed up for the XPRIZE. Peter said that the idea for his space prize came from reading about the $25,000 Orteig prize offered first in 1919 to the first aviator who could fly nonstop from Paris to New York or New York to Paris.  “I’d love to meet some of the teams,” Elon said. Adeo offered to join the XPRIZE board. Well after midnight, the men finally walked out of the restaurant and were greeted by the white-clad valet. They had plans to meet the next morning to continue the discussion. As Peter drove back to his apartment in Santa Monica, he turned on his recorder and began to reflect. It was strange, he said, how until tonight, he had felt like the kid in the room. Now, at forty, he felt more like the elder statesman. Both Adeo and Elon were weeks shy of turning thirty. They were just starting on space; he had never been anywhere else. “They only have ten million to fifteen million to spend,” Peter said as he drove. “They could be backers of the XPRIZE. Regardless, I get the feeling we’ll be friends. I really liked this guy Elon. He was quieter, but sounded serious about space. I think I planted some ideas, some seeds, maybe some direction, tonight.”",TECH,TECH
The Endangered Species Act Celebrates Forty Years Of Wildlife Protection (VIDEO),"On Dec. 28, 1973, President Richard Nixon signed a crucial piece of legislation for wildlife protection: the Endangered Species Act. Created ""to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend,"" it came into place after Nixon called on the 93rd Congress to provide more intensive conservation efforts in 1972.  To celebrate 40 years of critical environmental rebuilding and conservation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service created a comprehensive website with resources for everyone, including endangered species coloring pages for kids, short videos on recovery success stories and an interactive map to learn more about endangered species in your state.   They also created this video -- which traces the history and applications of the Act with action footage from the field -- to mark the anniversary. ""The Endangered Species Act has played an integral role in wildlife conservation for four decades, giving us the ability to work with partners across the nation to prevent the extinction of hundreds of species, recover many others, and protect fragile habitat that supports both species and people,""  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said in a press release. ""We face enormous challenges as we seek to sustain and build on this success, which is why we're committed to improving our ability to work collaboratively with landowners and other key stakeholders at a landscape scale."" To date, 99 percent of the species protected by the ESA have avoided extinction. Co-administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1,400 domestic species of plants and animals and 600 foreign species are currently protected under this law. It's responsible for the successful recovery of the bald eagle, the black-footed ferret and the California condor, among others.  Plant and animal species can receive protection under this law by gaining a listing of ""endangered"" or ""threatened."" Species have to meet at least one of five factors: damage to habitat, over-utilization of the species, disease or predation, lack of existing protection or other factors affecting the species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Gaining recognition under the law means advanced habitat protection, extensive monitoring and a ban on their take and trade.  The Endangered Species Act has been a crucial protection for animals affected by habitat loss, pollution and harvesting -- and will be increasingly imperative as animals face the threats of climate change. Scientists argue that in the future we'll need even more than the Endangered Species Act to protect lands and wildlife, such as advanced partnerships with private lands, faster listing services and additional efforts to mitigate climate change.

Tim Cook Pauses During Apple Keynote To Address Shooting In Orlando,"Apple CEO Tim Cook took a moment Monday during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco to acknowledge the victims of a shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida. The shooting killed 49 and injured 53 others. ""Before we start with the keynote we’d like to take a moment to talk about the tragedy that occurred yesterday in Orlando, Florida,"" Cook said in the opening lines of the event. ""We offer our deepest sympathies to everyone whose lives were touched by this violence. It was a senseless, unconscionable act of terrorism and hate aimed at dividing and destroying."" He continued: The Apple community is made up of people from all around the world, from all different backgrounds, and all different points of view. We celebrate our diversity. We know that it makes us stronger and moves everyone forward. Please rise and join us in a moment of silence to honor the victims and the people who love them. In a 2014 essay, Cook came out as gay, writing, ""I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.” A year earlier, during a speech at Auburn University on the topic of human rights, Cook said the discrimination he experienced growing up shaped his worldview. ""I have seen and have experienced many types of discrimination,"" he said, ""and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority.”",TECH,TECH
Meet The Pro-Gun Democrat Taking On Congress’ Mini-Trump,"WASHINGTON ― It’s been hard to miss Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), the bombastic first-term congresswoman whose penchant for making controversial statements has drawn comparisons to President Donald Trump and former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).  The New York Republican drew a firestorm of criticism when, in the wake of the Parkland school shooting, she claimed that many people who commit mass murders “end up being Democrats.” She later blamed the “twist and smear” media for ginning up controversy over her remark, calling the press the “single biggest destructive force in our country.” After a number of Democrats chose not to stand and clap during portions of the president’s State of the Union address earlier this year, she claimed they didn’t “love our country.” And she has blamed the “deep state” over a $31,000 dining set bought for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson’s office. Tenney’s confrontational style stands in stark contrast to her Democratic challenger, New York state Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi. The 39-year-old lawmaker from Utica has largely flown under the radar in the national media despite announcing his campaign a nearly a year ago. He has preferred to keep a low profile, focusing instead on his district, which covers the small upstate cities of Rome and Utica. Last week, for example, he launched a decidedly anodyne petition calling for an investigation into internet rate hikes by a New York cable provider.  “Folks back home don’t want our community to make national news because of the controversial things that our representative says,” Brindisi told HuffPost on Thursday. “They want a representative who’s going to fight to get them better health care, who’s going to provide middle-class tax cuts, and who is going to stand up to corporate special interests that are driving the conversation in Washington.” Brindisi’s approach appears to be working ― at least for the moment. He has led in several recent polls of the race. Moreover, he has outraised his GOP opponent ever since he entered the contest in June ― an unusual feat for a candidate who is taking on an incumbent. In the first quarter of 2018, Brindisi hauled in over $450,000 in contributions compared to just $258,000 for Tenney. His campaign currently also has about $200,000 more in cash on hand. “It’s somewhat unexpected. Everybody thought it’d be a close race. To have him in the lead right now is pretty remarkable,” said Luke Perry, a professor of politics and government at Utica College. While Brindisi has beat expectations, it’s still too early to tell whether he can succeed in ousting an incumbent in what has traditionally been a GOP district. Though a moderate, he has received backing from labor and education groups, as well as the Democratic establishment in the state. He’s liked by his colleagues in Albany and is well-known in northern portions of the congressional district. And he is likely to benefit from what many observers see as a coming blue wave in November. But the race for New York’s 22nd Congressional District is expected to be one of the most competitive in the nation, and likely the top battleground in New York state. National Republicans and their allies will likely spend heavily to defend the seat. Brindisi, meanwhile, has run unopposed in his assembly district since 2011.  Tenney and the National Republican Congressional Committee have already sought to cast Brindisi as a liberal, describing him as a “socialist” who is beholden to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Moreover, Brindisi’s name recognition may be a problem in some areas of the district. About 65 percent of voters said in a recent Democratic poll that they did not know enough about the candidate yet to form an opinion of him. “He’s got to try to convince constituents he’s a moderate when he’s being cast as the opposite. He’s gotta be careful not go too negative,” Perry said. Pelosi’s long-awaited public announcement earlier this week that she will run for House speaker if Democrats win a majority this fall generated gleeful cheers among Republicans in Washington. The GOP has successfully used the California Democrat’s image and progressive politics to bash Democratic candidates in swing districts in prior contests. To that end, Tenney questioned this week whether Brindisi would support Pelosi, and further accused the Democratic leader of “bankrolling” his campaign. Brindisi blunted that line of attack on Thursday, however, when he made clear that he would not support Pelosi as speaker if elected in November.  “I think it’s time for new Democratic leadership in Washington,” he told HuffPost, becoming only the latest Democratic candidate to say so.  The National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, called Brindisi’s distancing of Pelosi politically expedient.  “Like a typical Albany machine politician, he’s proven once again that he will say anything to get elected,” NRCC spokesman Chris Martin said in a statement. Brindisi has toed the Democratic Party line on a number of issues, including health care, education, taxes and the economy. He has blasted Tenney for voting to repeal Obamacare as well as a number of financial regulations, and he has criticized the congresswoman for her support of the recent GOP tax law, which slashed taxes on big corporations. While he has not yet received support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which highlighted him as one of its “Red to Blue” candidates, a super PAC aligned with the Democratic Party has begun running ads in support of his campaign. The latest 30-second television spot from House Majority PAC blasted Tenney for voting to repeal Obamacare. But Brindisi, a self-described “strong supporter of the Second Amendment,” is notably to the right of many Democrats on the issue of guns. Although he supports expanding background checks on gun purchases, he earned a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association, the nation’s top gun lobby, thanks to his vote against the New York SAFE Act, a 2013 gun control law written in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He believes several of the law’s regulations ought to be repealed because they overly restrict the rights of upstate New York’s gun owners and because it was rushed through the Legislature in the wake of the massacre. “I firmly believe that a representative can support the Second Amendment and support common-sense reforms to try and cut down mass gun violence that occurs in our country,” he told HuffPost, emphasizing that he has not and does not intend to accept any donations from the NRA. Asked whether he supported banning assault weapons, Brindisi demurred, however, stating that he believed the “conversation has to be how do we keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people.” Brindisi wouldn’t be the first pro-gun Democrat from rural Trump country to seek office and win. In March, Conor Lamb won the special congressional election in Pennsylvania’s 18th District on a platform that included not supporting additional gun control measures. He, too, said he’d like to see House Democrats replace Pelosi as their leader. It helped inoculate him from GOP attacks that tied him to Pelosi ― and it may help Brindisi equally well. For House Democrats, the path to regaining a majority depends on moderate candidates like Brindisi. Trump’s approval rating in upstate New York, especially, has declined, and party leaders are hoping they can woo Trump voters who haven’t benefited from GOP policies on health care, the budget and taxes. “For Democrats to be successful nationally, they have to win districts like some of the ones in New York,” Perry said. “If Republican incumbents don’t get re-elected in places like here, it’s not a good sign the party more broadly.”",POLITICS,POLITICS

What Your Movements May Reveal About How You'll Get Along With Another Person,"The way we move can offer a surprising level of insight into our personalities, according to new research. A team of European researchers recently found that each of us has an ""individual motor signature"" -- and this signature forms a blueprint for mapping out subtle differences in our movements compared to others, Dr. Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova, a professor of mathematics for health care at the University of Exeter in England and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post.  While the mechanics of human movement on a broad level has been well-studied, scientists have paid less attention to individual differences in movement, until now.  ""We show that different individuals have different motor signatures,"" she said. ""In other words, individuals could be classified based on the way they move."" Namely, the extent to which your movements are similar to another person’s can determine how easily you can coordinate with that person and how similar your behaviors are. The research, which was published in the journal Interface on Wednesday, involved a series of three experiments and about 82 participants. Some of the participants were asked to play a ""plain mirror game,"" in which two players imitated each other's movements, which were tracked and analyzed. It turned out that the players who were better at mimicking each other's movements -- including qualities like speed and weight of movement -- also exhibited more collective behaviors. By comparing the two individuals' movement signatures, the researchers could also determine the level of comfort and rapport in the relationship. Imitation is known to be important to our ability to develop friendships and form bonds with others. ""We know that when people move in synchrony -- marching, chanting, drumming, etc. -- it stimulates collaboration,"" said Carol Kinsey Goman, body language expert and author of The Silent Language of Leaders, who was not involved in the study. ""It is normal, human behavior to mirror the posture and movement of those we agree with and like."" These new findings suggest that people who are better able to sync their individual movement signatures with each other’s have personalities that are more compatible. ""This study shows that people who move in a certain way, will also react in similar ways when they are performing joint tasks,"" Tsaneva-Atanasova said in a statement. ""Essentially, our movements give an insight into our inherent personality traits.""  The researchers concluded that analyzing these motor signatures could one day offer a new pathway into diagnosing and treating mental illness, such as conditions involving social phobias. For instance, scientists could develop virtual reality technology in which a patient is asked to mimic the bodily movements of an avatar.  ""What we demonstrate is that ... movement gives an indication of a person's behavioral characteristics,"" Tsaneva-Atanasova said. ""This could therefore be used in the future to help diagnose patients with certain conditions by studying how they move and react to others.""",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
U.S. Climate Scientists Flee For France To ‘Make Our Planet Great Again’,"Fourteen climate researchers, including six from U.S. universities, have been selected for French President Emmanuel Macron’s “Make Our Planet Great Again” initiative. The scientists applied to move to France to carry out climate science projects in the country’s top research laboratories. The selected researchers include some of America’s brightest scientific talents: Alexey Fedorov, a Yale professor and Guggenheim fellow, and James Clark, a Duke University climate expert, according to a press release Wednesday from France’s Ministry of Higher Education and Research. Researchers hailing from universities in several other countries, including Canada and Saudi Arabia, also were selected. The applicants’ projects, covering a range of topics including Arctic climate change and improving air quality, are expected to last three to five years. Each researcher will receive at least $600,000 in funding, according to the statement, which noted that Germany is now jointly supporting the initiative. Macron first introduced “Make Our Planet Great Again” last year, after President Donald Trump announced plans to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Macron urged climate scientists and others around the world to apply for an opportunity to work in France. Trump’s “decision is unfortunate but it only reinforced our determination,” Macron said in a message on the initiative’s website. “France has always led fights for human rights. Today, more than ever, we are determined to lead (and win!) this battle on climate change.” Macron reiterated his commitment to fighting climate change in an address to the U.S. Congress last week.  “What is the meaning of our life, really, if we work and live destroying the planet, sacrificing the future of our children?” he asked lawmakers during his visit to Washington. Come here with us to work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. pic.twitter.com/JXiqgMP8Xy The first group of 18 scientists selected for the program was announced in December. That group included 13 researchers from U.S. universities, including Camille Parmesan, a professor at the University of Texas and U.K.’s University of Plymouth who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for her work as a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The impact of Trump on climate science has been far greater than what the public believe it has,” Parmesan told The Guardian of her decision to move to France to continue her research. “He has not only slashed funding, but he’s gone on the attack in any way he can with his powers as the president.”",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"All My Friends Are Having Babies, Meanwhile I Did A Newborn Photoshoot With A Twist","As I moved into my late 20s, my Facebook feeds started to morph. One by one, my friends posted their exciting pregnancy announcements, and it seemed like in the blink of an eye, my feeds turned into a never-ending reel of babies doing mundane things. Captions like “Little Timmy found his hands today! I’ve never been so proud,” or “Awwwww, my baby pooped by herself! They grow up so fast,” became the constant reminder that life was in fact moving on ahead of me. And that I wasn’t in any rush to catch up. While my friends were cooking buns in the oven, I was heating up the idea of trying out a new piece of equipment for my travel photography. Would I upgrade my lenses? Would I invest in new accessories? Would I try a new camera all together? Were my husband and I ready for a new piece of equipment? I mean, all our house plants have died slow, miserable deaths. There were just so many questions to run through and it seemed like there was never a perfect time to commit to such a huge life decision. Screw it, there’s never a perfect time right? So I jumped in and bought a drone. World meet my newest addition: Mav, a DJI Mavic Pro. It was love at first flight. This little, compact drop is packed full of features and is already given me whole new perspective on life. I’m still a little nervous flying Mav, but you're always more nervous with the first one aren’t you? I took inspiration from the photoshoots childfree couples have done with their adorable dogs, for my own ‘newborn drone’ photos to welcome little Mav to the family. We didn’t let him rest too long though, so far he has already been flying over Greek Island coastlines and dreamy sandbars in the Maldives! I may not be able to relate to my Facebook feed anymore, but maybe that’s not so bad. We all have our different paths and passions to follow after all and it just takes one look at this little bundle of joy and I’m reminded of where I’m meant to be. Hopefully he has a better life than the late house plants. Photos originally posted to the Facebook page for The Katie Show Blog.

Is ISIS Taking Notes From Star Wars?,"The cinematographic prowess of the so-called Islamic State is, by now, well-known, admired, analyzed and even mocked. The films are so good, in fact, that the U.S. government's efforts to release anti-ISIS propaganda have sort of floundered.  Against this backdrop, the Department of Defense last year funded several studies through its Minerva Initiative for social science research that examine the phenomenon of extremist propaganda. One of the studies conjectures that the reason ISIS videos are so effective is they use the tropes of Hollywood blockbusters -- particularly movies with ""heroic quests"" -- to appeal to would-be extremists. The ""Social and Neurological Construction of Martyrdom Project,"" directed by University of Chicago professor Robert Pape, received $3.4 million from the DOD to scan people's brains as they watch ISIS recruitment videos.  Pape thinks the heroic narrative of modern-day ISIS videos is a stark contrast to the grainy, single-camera screeds of previous groups like al Qaeda (think: Osama bin Laden speaking to a camera). His lab will scan subjects with FMRIs as they watch ISIS films to determine what specific parts of the films elicit the greatest brain activity. This, he thinks, is the key to unlocking the power of these videos -- and to countering them. ""ISIS doesn’t just have better camera and techniques; they’ve adopted a heroic narrative that comes specifically out of Hollywood screenwriters,"" Pape told The Huffington Post. ""This narrative is emotionally arousing and resonant, which can be a powerful motivator for young, would-be radicals."" He thinks this story structure may also affect specific brain regions like the amygdala, two almond-shaped areas that are key to emotional processing. Previous research has shown that the human brain is hardwired for storytelling and to respond to narratives. The control group in the study, which commences this fall, will be shown soothing videos like a nature documentary. Pape says ISIS videos closely mirror the 12-step narrative outlined in the popular 2007 screenwriting manual The Writer's Journey The manual is itself based on the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, who proposed an archetypal ""hero's journey"" that is common to myths, stories and folktales from around the world.  Pape thinks this playbook can be seen as a direct blueprint for ISIS, which makes longer, feature-length films, in contrast to the short videos of its predecessors like al Qaeda.  ""Step by step, pace by pace, Hollywood has been using this formula to put millions and millions of viewers into seats,"" said Pape. ""And now ISIS is doing the same."" Christopher Vogler, author of The Writer's Journey, doesn’t think ISIS is taking his 12 steps quite so literally. ""ISIS is in the same media soup as anybody else in the world, and anybody who wants to portray their own group as heroic is going to -- without even thinking about it -- duplicate that pattern,"" he said. Jeffry Halverson, an Islamic studies professor at Coastal Carolina University, said jihadist propaganda has always relied on ""culturally-embedded master narratives.” ""The difference now is that ISIS is co-opting pop culture to appeal to youth, who might be swayed by promises of excitement and adventure more than condemnations of tyranny and heresy."" He says this differentiates ISIS from groups like al Qaeda, which used more ""traditional,"" less relatable stock figures like martyrs and tyrants instead of adventurous heroes. For instance, al Qaeda often invoked the story of ""Moses confronting the idolatrous tyrant Pharaoh for disobeying God,"" says Halverson, like in a 2002 statement that dubbed George W. Bush ""the pharaoh of this age."" Pape is not the first to try and pin down the appeal of ISIS videos through analogy. Javier Lesaca, an expert with the International Observatory for Terrorism Studies, has said ISIS deliberately mimics the look of video games like ""Call of Duty"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" to appeal to young men. But understanding how ISIS videos work may have limited use in isolation.  ""We've known for at least three years now that these videos work,"" says Pete Hatemi, a political science professor at Penn State. ""What should be our counter-strategy? That’s the real question."" Hatemi says the films are just one example that terrorists can subvert any medium for their own use. ""Terrorists' most effective weapon against democracy is our own media,"" he said. ""We have news services, and they make headlines."" So as we watch blockbuster movies, they make recruitment films. Pape thinks the insights from his study will help the U.S. make better anti-ISIS videos.  ""Their effort isn't working because they fail to engage viewers' emotions the way ISIS videos do,"" says Pape. He suggests the government adopt its own ""heroic logic"" to counter the vision of ISIS. ""Countering the ISIS hero metric would involve emphasizing that the individuals in ISIS are not working for the community and are not patriots, but they are, instead, individually motivated, and should be seen as foreign occupiers whose desires are at odds with the local community,"" he suggested. Hatemi, on the other hand, thinks it doesn’t need to be that hard.  ""We could also just pick up what ISIS leaves out,"" he said. ""They don't show the beatings, torture, rations, and terrible living conditions in an ISIS propaganda film. If we showed that, it could be half the battle.""",SCIENCE,TECH
"Sherwin Smith, Tennessee Official, Says Water Quality Complaints Could Be 'Act Of Terrorism' (AUDIO)"," A Tennessee state official reportedly told residents who were concerned about dirty drinking water that complaining about water quality could be considered ""an act of terrorism."" The controversial comment was made by Sherwin Smith, the deputy director of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's (TDEC) Division Of Water Resources, during a May 29 meeting organized by Tennessee state Rep. Sheila Butt (R-Columbia). ""You need to make sure that when you make water quality complaints you have basis,"" Smith said, according to audio obtained by Statewide Organizing For Community eMpowerment (SOCM), a Knoxville-based civic action group. ""Because federally, if there's no water quality issues, that can be considered, under Homeland Security, an act of terrorism.""  The comments came during a discussion over poor water quality in Tennessee's Maury County, where residents have said people have gotten sick from drinking the water.    In January, the town of Mt. Pleasant, Tenn. issued a ""boil water"" notice to residents due to health risks posed by bacteria in the water, Bobby Nutt, the town's public works director, told The Columbia Daily Herald at the time.  Meg Lockhart, a spokeswoman for the state environmental agency, said it was looking into Smith's comments.  “The department would like to fully assess what was said in the meeting. I am told that the meeting was far longer than the audio clip provided by SOCM and that Mr. Smith actually clarified his remarks. But again, we are looking into it,” Lockhart said, according to The Tennessean.  As written in the Code of Laws of the United States, terrorism is ""premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets.""

Scientists Can Detect Your Sleeptime Memories Even If You Can’t,"For the very ambitious who want to capitalize on the one-third of their lives spent asleep, learning while snoozing is the ultimate dream. Just imagine if you could learn a new language by streaming podcasts into your sleeping ears. And then another language, and then another. That unfortunately is still a dream. But in a new study, published Aug. 24 in the journal Neuroscience of Consciousness, researchers found that faint traces of memory formed during sleep even if the individuals themselves remained largely unaware of those memories.  In the study, neuroscientists Thomas Andrillon and Sid Kouider of Paris’ Ecole Normale Superieure asked 22 participants to listen to an audio stream of words as they drifted into sleep. The words kept playing in their ears during the nap. Upon awakening, participants did not remember the words they had heard while asleep and couldn’t tell them apart from new words in a memory test.   However, using electroencephalography, which picks up on the brain’s electrical activity, the researchers found an implicit memory trace for words presented during sleep: Hearing those words after the nap triggered a EEG result different from that of completely new words.   The scientists could correctly determine whether the participant’s brain had heard a certain word during sleep 55 percent of the time ― again even though the participant had no memory of it. Of course, 55 percent accuracy is hardly a reliable crystal ball for mind reading but it’s still above the level of chance, Andrillon said.  Moreover, EEG data are only an approximation of brain activity. It’s akin to trying to listen in on people’s conversations from outside a bar. You can’t hear much but can pick up on the occasional collective cheer. The finding that words heard in sleep leave a trace behind was corroborated by measuring participants’ confidence level in memory tests. When participants were asked if a certain word was presented to them during sleep, they expressed a bit more confidence in their answer when it was correctly yes — as if they had a hunch about that word. Scientists know that during sleep, the brain reviews and stores information learned throughout the day. This nighttime housekeeping, it’s been thought, keeps the brain too busy to form any new memories of what happens during sleep itself. But the new findings suggest that some minimal memory formation is possible. Still, that doesn’t mean you can learn new information during sleep in any useful way. If anything, the memory traces were so weak that one could conclude the opposite: that it’s really hard, if not impossible, to learn anything useful during sleep. In other words, Andrillon said, the potential benefits of nighttime learning are not worth losing quality sleep over.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Wastewater Injection By Energy Companies Increases Risk Of California Earthquakes: Report,"Many of California's oil industry wastewater injection wells are near recently active fault lines, posing a risk of earthquakes that could damage crucial infrastructure in the state, according to a report by three environmental groups. The report, released on Thursday, maps the proximity of California's active wastewater disposal wells to the state's fault lines and heavily populated areas, such as Los Angeles, Kern and Ventura counties.  The three groups -- Earthworks, Clean Water Action and the Center for Biological Diversity -- said they found 54 percent of California's 1,553 active and new wastewater injection wells are within 10 miles of a recently active fault. (A recently active fault was defined as one that has caused an earthquake in the past 200 years.) The report argues that scientists have said there's a risk of earthquakes within 12.4 miles of injection wells.   
A graphic from the report by the three environmental groups. Wastewater injection wells have been linked to earthquakes in states including Ohio and Arkansas but not California. The wells are used by energy companies to get rid of the fluids that are a byproduct of many oil and gas extraction methods, including hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking,"" a process in which liquids are pumped into underground rock formations to release hydrocarbons.   Waste liquids that are a byproduct of oil and gas extraction are often injected back into the ground because it is the most inexpensive way to get rid of them, says Anthony Ingraffea, a professor of engineering at Cornell who's advocated against shale gas and oil development in the past. Other options for disposing of the liquids, like using industrial treatment plants, are much more costly, explains Ingraffea, who is on the board of Earthworks, one of the organizations that published the report.  But pumping the water into underground rock formations can build up pressure, which, if exerted on a fault that is already stressed, can cause earthquakes, the report says. (In 2012, a wastewater disposal well in northeastern Ohio was permanently shut down after a series of quakes in the well's vicinity.) But the report, which has not been peer-reviewed, should be taken with a grain of salt, some say. (Story continues below)

Where California's waste-water injection wells are in relation to the state's fault lines and populated areas. The report, ""On Shaky Ground: Fracking, Acidizing, And Increased Earthquake Risk In California,"" used publicly available data from the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Geological Survey and California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources to make the maps.
 Dave Quast, the California director of Energy In Depth, a research and public outreach campaign launched in 2009 by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said the report unfairly singles out the oil and gas industries and attempts to scare people about a nonexistent threat.  ""Wastewater injection is a common way to get rid of water across all industries,"" Quast said. ""It has nothing to do with fracking in particular... There's never been a case of earthquakes from wastewater injection in California, and there's no reason to think there ever will be.""  Rock Zierman, the CEO of the California Independent Petroleum Association, a Sacramento-based nonprofit trade association representing oil and gas producers, echoed that point.  ""We reinject 3 billion barrels of produced water into the earth in California every year, and have done so for over 50 years. We've never had a problem,"" Zierman said, adding that the report was authored by ""environmental activists who are not seismologists."" State officials also voiced skepticism of the paper's findings.  “We are reviewing the report now, but at first glance, it appears to include some assumptions and conclusions that should be given consideration in a peer review process,"" Jason Marshall, the chief deputy director of the California Department of Conservation, said in an email. Marshall added that California requires energy companies to evaluate subsurface geology before conducting disposal projects.

Amazon Voice Assistant Alexa Orders Herself Some Dollhouses,"Amazon’s ever-helpful virtual assistant, Alexa, is apparently trying to get some extra toys in U.S. households — possibly just before world domination. The voice-activated gizmo-controller was only happy to comply last week after it heard 6-year-old Brooke Neitzel ask, “Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?” Presto: A $170 KidKraft Sparkle mansion dollhouse was delivered to Brooke’s Dallas home, along with four pounds of sugar cookies. Brooke admitted she’d also discussed cookies with Alexa, her mom, Meghan Neitzel, told Fox News. Family members are still eating the cookies, and plan to donate the dollhouse to a charity. They’re also whispering more around Alexa. But the shopping spree didn’t end there. When a San Diego TV station covered the Dallas story, Alexa perked up again — in other households. After local CW6 anchor Jim Patton commented on-air, “I love the little girl, saying ‘Alexa ordered me a dollhouse,’” Alexa owners watching the broadcast found that the remark triggered orders on their own devices. Patton said a number of viewers emailed him or called the station to report what had happened.   Alexa is the voice of Amazon Echo, which does everything from getting a weather report to ordering more laundry detergent to turning on a consumer’s music and lights. The device adapts to speech patterns and vocabulary, but can’t distinguish between specific voices. That’s causing some security and privacy concerns. “All of these devices which record the internet of things will have some sort of website control, some sort of setting. You need to go into these settings and look at what they are, and what you can change,” cybersecurity research expert Stephen Cobb told CW6. Alexa’s settings can be adjusted through the app to either switch off voice ordering or set up a password to prevent accidental purchases. And it’s probably best to do that sooner rather than later, because Alexa’s influence only continues to expand. Several major appliance brands and automakers are now planning to integrate Alexa into their products. Amazon sold some 5 million Echo systems as of November, reports Yahoo.",TECH,TECH
Does Your Credit Card Offer Enough Travel Insurance?,"Is Dan Kriser overdoing it? “I know that as long as you have a major credit card you don’t need to buy additional insurance when you rent a car,” says Kriser, an investment manager from Highland Park, Ill.. “But how about trip insurance when you travel?” Specifically, Kriser wants to know how his credit card ― a United MileagePlus Visa Signature ― stacks up to his Allianz Global Assistance plan. “Am I buying essentially the same insurance twice?” he wonders. Answer: they are not the same. And it’s an important exercise for the rest of us, who might be thinking of skipping a travel insurance policy for an upcoming trip. Read the fine print before you make any decision. Credit card insurance may or may not work. I normally hear about it when it doesn’t, like Monique Tubb’s case. Her adult daughter was injured while vacationing in Colorado, so she canceled the rest of her trip and flew home immediately. Tubb thought her UnitedPlus Explorer card’s insurance would help her, but it didn’t. Turns out the card only covered “prepaid” expenses. Travel insiders like Ann Geraci know that you have to carefully review the credit card terms before your trip. Geraci, a travel agent from Northbrook, Ill., notes that her MasterCard covers trip interruption and cancellation due to medical reasons. “But the hitch is that is MasterCard takes the claim, then must wait 12 months before refunding the amount,” she says. Why so long? Because a ticket has value for 12 months from date of issue, even though the ticket amount is less than the $200 exchange fee in case you wanted to apply to another ticket. “So, buy the additional insurance if you want, and wait just 30 to 60 days for the refund ― or place the claim with your credit card and wait the 12 months for full refund.” Who knew? Kriser’s question doesn’t have a quick answer. If you take a look at the lengthy benefits guide and then compare it to a sample Allianz policy, you’ll see why. The card insurance covers basics like car rentals, trip interruption and cancellation. The standard “named perils” travel insurance policy covers more events, including delays, emergency medical and dental costs, and change fees. Even when the coverage looks the same, there are important differences. Consider travel delays. The insurance delay policy kicks in if you’re delayed more for six or more consecutive hours for one of the following covered reasons: ✓ Strike or common carrier delay ✓ Your departure is delayed by a common carrier. ✓ Your departure is delayed by an unannounced strike. ✓ You are quarantined. ✓ Natural disaster or severe weather ✓ Severe weather delays your departing flight or causes road closures. ✓ Politics, violence or theft ✓ Your passports, money or other travel documents are lost or stolen. ✓ Your travel is delayed by a hijacking. ✓ Your travel is delayed by civil disorder or unrest. Allianz covers prepaid expenses, as well as “reasonable” meals, accommodation and transportation expenses, up to $200 per day. The card policy only covers equipment failure, inclement weather, labor strikes, and hijacking or skyjacking, but it only kicks in after 12 hours. It pays up to $500 for each purchased airline ticket. And, of course, you need to use that particular credit card to pay for your ticket. So should you rely on your card’s insurance or not? Depends. I hear from a fair number of travelers who wish they had purchased a real policy through an insurance company. But I also hear from folks like Julie Fried, whose luggage was delayed on a recent flight from Baltimore to St. Lucia. Her airline offered to cover some, but not all, of her expenses. “We had had many expenses due to our circumstances and spent a few hundred over what the airline allotted,” she remembers. “Our credit card told us to submit the rest of our receipts and to write a letter explaining the situation. It covered the difference with no problem.” Bottom line: Read your card coverage carefully when you make your travel plans. If you think you might need more protection, consider buying it. After you’ve left a comment here, let’s continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google. I also have a newsletter and you’ll definitely want to order my new, amazingly helpful and subversive book called How to Be the World’s Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle).",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
American Cities Losing The Most Jobs This Year,"  The U.S. economy added roughly 2.4 million workers over the past year. Over the same period, the unemployment rate fell from 5.0% to 4.9%, close to the lowest it has been in nearly a decade. The 1.7% employment growth nationwide was not uniform, and some areas lost a substantial share of workers. To determine the cities that lost the most jobs, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most cities added jobs in past 12 months, and most have posted unemployment declines. In 75 metro areas, however, there was a net loss in total employment. The Lafayette, Louisiana metro area had the greatest loss workers, with total employment falling by 4.5% since October 2015. One major factor driving employment changes across the United States is industrial composition. Continued outsourcing and automation has lowered international demand for American manufacturing, and the downturn in the price of petroleum has hurt the oil and gas sector. Nationwide, the worst performing sectors were manufacturing, information, and mining, logging, and construction. Click here to see the American cities losing the most jobs this year. Cities with economies that heavily depend on these industries tended to have the most job loss. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Martin Kohli, chief regional economist at the BLS, explained that a “large concentration of employment in energy and construction-related industries has definitely been negative in the last few years for communities.” In many cases, a major round of layoffs or plant shutdowns contributed to employment declines in the past year. People are not likely to move to a city without a job or some other opportunity available. As a result, the distribution of employment growth across the country mirrors today’s domestic migration patterns. Kohli added that residents of the Northeast and Midwest, where a majority of the metro areas are losing workers, have been relocating to major cities in the Sun Belt, which is gaining the most workers. Employment tends to increase as unemployment declines. In metropolitan areas losing the most workers, employment declines contributed to labor force declines and a rise in unemployment. In Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for example, the 14,200 workers lost in Oklahoma City was among the most of any metro area. At the same time, the labor force shrank by a total of 9,000 workers, while area unemployment rate rose from 3.6% to 4.4%. To identify the cities losing the most workers, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed metropolitan statistical areas with the largest employment decline from October 2015 through October 2016. Unemployment rates, the size of the labor force, and employment levels are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and are seasonally adjusted. Industry-specific growth rates for the same period are from the Current Employment Survey (CES), a monthly BLS survey. Educational attainment is from the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau. These are the cities losing the most jobs.   5. Mansfield, OH Cities without a talented, educated workforce often rely on one dominant, low-skilled industry and may be more vulnerable to changes in commodity prices and other market shifts than more diversified economies. Nearly one in five workers in Mansfield works in manufacturing, and just 14.4% of adults in the metro area have at least a bachelor’s degree. As demand for American manufacturing continues to decline, Mansfield’s reliance on the industry may have partially caused accelerated employment decline over the past year. The number of employed workers in the city decreased by 2.3% in 2016, more than nearly any other metro area.   4. Shreveport-Bossier City, LA Employment in the Shreveport-Bossier City area decreased by over 4,200 workers in the past year. During the same period, nearly an equal amount of people left the labor force. Following the statewide trend, the Shreveport area is losing workers in the oil and gas sector. Unlike other areas in Louisiana that are more dependent on the oil and gas industry, however, Shreveport has a more diverse economy, and employment losses in this industry have had a less dramatic effect on the area's overall employment. Still, due to falling oil prices and reduced natural gas production at the Haynesville Shale -- a rock formation rich in natural gas -- the industry's job losses accounted for a sizable share of the area's 2.3% employment decrease.   3. Houma-Thibodaux, LA The number of employed workers in the Houma-Thibodaux area decreased by around 3,400 in the past year. While area employment declined by 3.7%, the number of workers increased by 1.7% nationwide. A large share of the area’s employment decline resulted from a shrinking oil and gas sector. Following a drop in oil prices and the first decrease in North American oil production in years, many oil workers nationwide have lost their jobs. The effects of these industry declines are exaggerated in Houma-Thibodaux, where a large share of residents are employed in the sector.   2. Casper, WY The Casper metro area lost around 1,500 employed workers in the past year. This 3.8% decrease was largely caused by a declining coal mining industry in Wyoming. During the first quarter of 2016, coal production nationwide was the lowest it has been in 35 years, with Wyoming among the regions whose production has declined the most. The Casper metro area is around 100 miles from America’s two largest coal mines. Earlier this year, both of these mines announced large layoffs.   1. Lafayette, LA The Lafayette metro area lost around 9,400 workers in the past year. Employment in the area fell by around 4.5%, even as nationwide employment increased by 1.7%. Following a trend of declining manufacturing employment nationwide, Lafayette’s manufacturing sector shed the most jobs of any industry. The employment declines likely led to a large share of residents giving up looking for work or leaving the area. The overall labor force decreased by nearly 8,500 in the past year. This 3.8% decline in labor force was the largest of any U.S. metro area.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Meet The First UFC Fighter To Wear A Turban To A Match,"Arjan Singh Bhullar, the first Sikh fighter signed by the American mixed martial arts organization Ultimate Fighting Championship, will have another historic milestone to celebrate this week.  The 31-year-old will square off against Adam Wieczorek on Saturday in Glendale, Arizona, and wear a turban ― a Sikh article of faith ― as he makes his way to the ring. He’ll be the first UFC fighter to do so. Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost he hopes Bhullar and his turban, also known as a dastaar, will raise awareness about the Sikh community.  “A majority of Americans do not even know who Sikhs are!” Ahuja told HuffPost. ”I think Bhullar’s appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and I think his career will inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.”  Bhullar’s upcoming fight is particularly significant as it lands on Vaisahki, a festival that observes the founding of the body of fully initiated Sikhs known as the Khalsa. Bhullar, who in his UFC debut last September also became the group’s first fighter of Indian descent, hasn’t always been able to showcase his pride in his heritage. He had planned to wear his turban to his initial match, but UFC policies barred that. A UFC spokesman told HuffPost that Bhullar did not follow the group’s “approval process for a change in apparel. Once UFC was given more time to vet the request, approval was granted. Going forward, he will be allowed to walk to the octagon [ring] with a turban.” Bhullar told ESPN UK that the September incident “was disappointing and upsetting and frustrating.” He said that UFC officials needed “some educating and getting them on the same page, but I think we’ve done that.” Bhullar, who has a 7-0 record in his bouts, has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is. His grandfather arrived in Canada from India in 1959 and faced racism because of his beard and turban, the fighter told the video show MMA Hour. Bhullar’s father took up wrestling as a way to protect himself at a time when the turban was not accepted, Vice Sports reported, and also used the sport as a way to connect with his peers. Bhullar himself represented Canada in wrestling at the 2012 Summer Games in London, before turning to the sport of mixed martial arts.  Considering his family’s past and legacy, he said he has a duty to honor those before him.  “I always try to represent, to be more than just an athlete, more than just your sport, I consider it selfish to be going in there and just fighting… So many people in my community have sacrificed for me to be in the position I’m at,” Bhullar told Global News.  More than 60 percent of Americans knew nothing about Sikh Americans, a 2015 study revealed. The survey also found that when seeing someone wearing a turban, Americans were more likely to assume the individual was Muslim or Middle Eastern rather than Sikh. And according to the poll, more than half of Sikh children faced bullying in schools, with rates even more drastic for those wearing turbans.  “It is frankly commonly associated with terrorism and religious extremism,” Ahuja said of the turban.  Sikhs, though, wear it as a show of commitment to values that include service, compassion, and honesty. Ahuja said that with more visibility and representation, perhaps people will “correctly associate that the person who wears a turban will fight for equality and the rights of all people.” “We want UFC fans to know that ... for hundreds of years, Sikhs have fought, and many have given their lives, to protect the rights of others—including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims—to practice their own religions,” he said. “Ultimately, our turban represents our commitment to fight for those values.” This story has been updated with a statement from UFC. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
All The Things The NRA Has Blamed For The Texas School Shooting,"It’s been a week since the mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, and the National Rifle Association has had time to make sense of why, exactly, this happened. It’s because of an abundance of doors. And junk food. And not believing in God. These are the things the NRA has blamed for 10 people being killed and 13 people being injured in last week’s massacre. Not once did the gun rights group raise concerns over the shooter’s easy access to firearms ― the 17-year-old student just used his dad’s guns ― or acknowledge that school shootings are now happening with such frequency in America that kids are developing post-traumatic stress disorder. The Texas shooting was the 16th school shooting this year. Another school shooting took place while this article was being written. But the NRA says guns aren’t the problem. Here’s a look at all the other things the group has said are the reasons for the horrifying uptick in gun violence at schools. A “culture of violence” Incoming NRA president Oliver North said the solution to mass shootings at schools is to focus on the “disease,” which is not about easy access to guns. “The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence,” North said on Fox News Sunday. “They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases.” Godlessness NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said it’s helpful to offer “thoughts and prayers” after every mass shooting because it brings God back into the discussion.  “Taking God out of our culture ... is at least partly to blame for the violence we see today,” he said on his Monday show. Too many doors in schools Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, said the Santa Fe shooting may have been caused by schools having “too many entrances” and that it may be time “to look at the design of our schools moving forward.” NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that Patrick is “exactly right.” Unhealthy diets NRA board member Ted Nugent said Tuesday that kids’ unhealthy diets are making them want to shoot up their schools. “Mark my words when the studies are finalized, you will find that Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, certainly Sandy Hook, these maniac murderers in Parkland and now Santa Fe, if you really studied the slovenliness and the zombie-like conduct of these murderers, you go back to their diet and examine what they’ve put into their sacred temple, and it’s all garbage,” Nugent said in an interview on Newsmax TV, a conservative media outlet. “I know people think I’m trying to get away from the gun issue, but it’s not a gun issue,” he added. “It is a conduct issue.” Ritalin North said the combination of kids growing up in a violent culture and then taking medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is causing a spike in school shootings. “They have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,” he said on Fox News Sunday. “If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten.” The overmedication of children “The problems that are producing scores of isolated young disturbed children who have convinced themselves that murdering their classmates is the way to get attention will not be solved at the gun store. It is in the home,” Loesch said Tuesday on an NRATV segment titled “The Overmedication of Children Is an Epidemic.” “It’s about the kind of people we’re raising these kids to become,” she said. “Progressive culture” NRATV commentator Colion Noir said loose gun laws aren’t the problem behind school shootings. It’s America’s progressive culture. “When are we going to be completely honest and acknowledge the awkward, bullied, sexually frustrated, psychotropic drug-laced, suicidal, mass shooters in the room for what they are?” he said on a Sunday NRATV segment. “Or are we just going to keep acting like we don’t know what’s going on in the name of not confronting the miserable reality that they are a creation of our so-called progressive culture and media?” Criticizing masculinity as toxic In the same segment, Noir blamed school shootings on parents failing to teach their kids “how to cope with the harsh realities of life.” “We shield them in safe spaces and give them participation trophies incentivizing mediocrity, and tell our young boys that their masculinity is toxic and our young girls that being a woman means acting like a man, further confusing the hell out of kids who are naturally going to struggle with their identity as is,” said Noir. Mainstream media NRATV host Grant Stinchfield said Monday that mainstream media outlets “wrote the mass shooters playbook.” “I place some of the blame on the #MSM. They recruit new players to their dark real life mass shooting reality show,” he tweeted.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Nature Has A Promising Replacement For Hormone-Scrambling Plastics: Shrimp Shells,"Javier Fernandez admits he's not a huge fan of chess. ""I'm not very good either,"" he says.  Nevertheless, his queen, king, rook and knight are attracting a lot of attention. The black and white chess pieces are made of plastic, but not the petroleum-based kind experts warn may be laden with hormone-scrambling chemicals. Rather, Fernandez and his colleagues molded the complex game pieces from a compostable material abundant in nature: Chitin.  It's the stuff of shrimp shells, insect armor and butterfly wings -- and now of a small collection of chess pieces, party cups and egg cartons in a Cambridge, Mass., lab. ""It's so cheap and abundant,"" said Fernandez, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and co-author of a  study on the material published in late February. ""Besides vertebrates and plants, it's in almost every other living thing on Earth.""  Meanwhile, leftovers from fossil fuel refining continue to be used to build everything from chip clips and cell phones, to children's toys and sippy cups. Evidence suggests the chemicals that give these plastic products their characteristic hardiness or flexibility, such as phthalates and bisphenol A, can pose nasty consequences for human health. Although still hotly debated, most studies of BPA, for example, find that it may mimic or block the body's hormone messengers responsible for such critical processes as metabolism, growth and reproduction.  As a result of rising concerns, BPA-free products have flooded the market.  But scientists now suspect that some BPA replacements may be just as harmful . Last week, Mother Jones exposed an apparent plastics industry campaign to bury such findings.  ""We're using plastics in so many ways that we don't even think about them anymore,"" said Laura Vandenberg, a hormone disruptor researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ""We still need these products. But the point was never to ban one chemical and replace it with another that has the exact same properties."" The new chitin-based bioplastic, Vandenberg said, ""holds tremendous promise.""  Public health concerns with petroleum-based plastics extend beyond users, to their production and disposal, said Fernandez. Toxic chemicals spew from polyvinyl chloride plants, for example. Plastic waste accumulates in oceans and breaks down into tiny bits, which can concentrate toxic pollutants and travel up the marine food chain. ""Most of our material is coming from marine animals themselves,"" said Fernandez of the chitin-based plastic. ""Once it is discarded, it degrades very easily -- especially at sea."" The material is compostable, and can be used as fertilizer. In their new research paper, Fernandez and his colleague, Dr. Donald Ingber, describe a new way to process chitosan, a form of chitin, making it potentially viable for large-scale manufacturing with traditional casting or injection molding techniques.  ""Pretty much anything you can mold, you can make out of this stuff,"" said Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital.  While ""potentially toxic additives"" are needed to alter the properties of conventional plastics, Ingber noted that plasticizers are not required in their material. Rather, they enlist natural ingredients such as water and wood flour, a waste product from wood processing, to optimize the material's shape, strength, resilience or flexibility. For certain products, such as the red, green and blue party cups Ingber and Fernandez created in their lab, recyclable dyes and wax coatings are added. The prototype cups, they noted, are about as strong as a typical store-bought cup or bottle. Of course, several challenges remain before the 10 billion tons of chitin produced by living organisms annually could have a chance of becoming a game-changer for the $375-billion-a-year plastics industry.

""It all comes down to cost,"" noted Ingber. ""Whatever you come up with in the lab needs to be scaled up.""  Ingber and Fernandez said they have obtained a number of patents, and are beginning to attract interest from companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. Two of the largest manufacturers of consumer goods, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, declined HuffPost requests for comment. James Berge, principal and director for science and technology at HOK, a global design, architecture, engineering and planning firm, said the new material so far appears ""a cost-effective stable material.""  ""The ability to injection mold and cast the material with existing manufacturing technologies is a big first hurdle and fundamental for manufacturing feasibility,"" Berge said. While optimistic, Amherst's Vandenberg added an important caution: ""Just because something is natural doesn't mean safe,"" she said. ""There is arsenic in well water.""  Joel Tickner, an expert in green chemistry at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, pointed out that new plastics -- even those made of chitin -- must undergo testing ""to ensure they are really better, and safer.""  The Food and Drug Administration said its approval is required for any new chitosan-based product that may contact food. The Environmental Protection Agency requires notification for manufacturing of other chitosan-derived materials. ""Chitin/chitosan offers a renewable, biobased feedstock alternative to traditional petroleum-based synthetics,"" the EPA said in a statement to HuffPost, noting that the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program has received nominations for chitin-based technologies. Many plant-based bioplastics also show potential to revolutionize the plastics industry, noted Tickner. He highlighted the efforts of NatureWorks, which is turning sugar derived from corn and other crops into a material now employed on a small scale to make clothing, water bottles and other consumer products.  Ingber and Fernandez said their bioplastic has benefits over other plant-based versions. It doesn't compete with land or other resources for basic human needs. Most of the available chitin comes from shrimp, which discard their shells every month or two. Seafood processing alone creates about 150,000 tons of usable chitosan every year. ""The plastic problem is so huge and so bad that we have to explore all options,"" Ingber said. ""This is an exciting one.""",ENVIRONMENT,SCIENCE
Betsy DeVos Stirs Uproar By Saying Schools Can Call ICE On Undocumented Kids,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos provoked an outcry Tuesday when she said schools can choose to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement on potentially undocumented students. “I think that’s a school decision, it’s a local community decision,” DeVos told the House Education and the Workforce Committee. “I refer to the fact that we have laws and we also are compassionate. I urge this body to do its job and address and clarify where there is confusion around this.” DeVos was responding to a question from Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) about whether she thinks school leaders should call ICE on students or their parents. Advocacy groups immediately protested her answer, pointing out that under the Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, all children ― undocumented or not ― are entitled to a free public education. Some demanded that DeVos issue an immediate clarification in light of this fact. Elizabeth Hill, press secretary for the U.S. Department of Education, provided HuffPost with a clarification of DeVos’ remarks on Wednesday. “Her position is that schools must comply with Plyler and all other applicable and relevant law,” said Hill. During the hearing, DeVos did note that the 1982 Supreme Court decision requires public schools to educate all students, including those who are undocumented. Still, she repeatedly said it was a school’s decision if it wanted to call ICE on kids and their parents. MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, issued a statement saying that DeVos should resign for “abject incompetence” if she does not “issue an immediate clarification that emphasizes the holding in Plyler.” The organization also said it “stands ready to hold accountable through legal challenge anyone in public education who attempts to report a student to ICE.” DeVos’ comments could have a chilling impact on undocumented students attending schools, said Andrea Senteno, legislative staff attorney for MALDEF, on Wednesday. Indeed, around the country, schools have seen substantial drops in attendance after ICE raids at local businesses.  “We are very concerned her statement yesterday leaves open to interpretation what the law actually is for schools and administrators and those in the community,” Senteno said. “There are going to be students and family members who are not going to know what that means.” The Education Department needs to make publicly clear “what the current law is and what students’ rights are,” said Senteno.  The American Civil Liberties Union also blasted DeVos’ comments at the hearing. “Let’s be clear: Any school that reports a child to ICE would violate the Constitution. The Supreme Court has made clear that every child in America has a right to a basic education, regardless of immigration status. Secretary DeVos is once again wrong,” said Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns for the ACLU, in a statement.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of MALDEF legislative staff attorney Andrea Senteno.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Health Care Costs Are Still A Crushing Problem,"Andrew Luccock pays about $1,700 per month for health insurance for his family of 5 — and still expects to pay more than $25,000 out-of-pocket this year for medical care. That will total around $45,000 for premiums and uncovered expenses in 2018 – on top of a similar outlay last year. “I’m angry. I feel trapped,” the 58-year-old insurance broker form Portland, Ore., tells Yahoo Finance. “I have enough cash flow coming in, but I keeping thinking, how does a normal person pay for this?” Congress fought some epic battles over health care during the last year — and in the end did precisely nothing to help a slice of Americans struggling with soaring health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The Trump administration, meanwhile, killed a subsidy associated with the Affordable Care Act, raising costs even more for those already facing the sharpest increases. The most crushing price hikes are hitting people who don’t get insurance from an employer or government program, and purchase it individually on the so-called non-group market. These over-the-barrel consumers tend to be small-business owners or independent contractors, and the steepest premiums hit those between 50 and 64. For people getting insurance through an employer, premiums rose just 3 percent in 2017 on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But premiums for individual policies rose a whopping 20 percent, and premium increases in 2018 may very well surpass last year’s. That’s happening for a couple of reasons. First, many insurers participating in the marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act set premiums too low when the law first went into effect in 2014. They’ve since adjusted upward, with sharp hikes in premiums for some customers. There are rules limiting premium increases under Obamacare itself, and big employers have negotiating leverage that helps keep a lid on the premiums their workers pay. But purchasers in the non-group market have hardly any leverage, so insurers have shifted the biggest price hikes there. President Trump’s decision last October to end “cost-sharing reduction” payments to insurers probably pushed premiums up even more, since insurers had to find additional ways to offset rising costs. Again, raising premiums on individual policy purchasers is the path of least resistance. Complete data for 2018 isn’t available yet, but Kaiser found likely premium increases ranging from 17 percent for a low-cost plan offering modest coverage to 32 percent for a medium-priced plan that covers more. Obamacare, as the ACA is known, provides subsidies for lower-income people buying insurance through an exchange, so they don’t feel the full sting of higher premiums. But people who earn too much to qualify for subsidies have no such protection, and end up bearing the full brunt of all the price hikes insurers are loading onto individual purchasers. There are about 10 million Americans covered by plans purchased on the individual market without ACA subsidies. Yahoo Finance surveyed more than 1,400 readers on their insurance costs from Jan. 12 – 15, and found more pain among people purchasing individual policies than those covered by any other source. More than 58 percent of people buying individual coverage said the cost was unaffordable or a major hardship, compared with just 43 percent overall. And 91 percent of those purchasing an individual policy said premiums went up this year, compared with just 78 percent of all respondents. Luccock, who buys insurance on the individual market, started seeing substantial price hikes in 2017, after his prior insurer pulled out of Oregon, unable to turn a sufficient profit. Monthly premiums rose from $1,050 per month to $1,350 under the new insurer, and then to $1,700 for 2018. Luccock’s 23-year-old son injured his back in 2016, requiring two medical procedures last year. But insurance would only pay for one, forcing Luccock to pay more than $40,000 out of pocket for the other. He paid half upfront last year, with the rest due this year. Since Luccock is an insurance broker who understands how the market works, he’s contemplating alternatives to traditional insurance. “I’m thinking I could put $4,000 or $5,000 a month into an investment account and eventually be able to cover most medical expenses myself,” Luccock says. “In the worst case, if something terrible happened, I’d just go bankrupt. How crazy is it for somebody like me to even contemplate self-insuring?” Others are giving up on insurance altogether. Mark Viator, a retired statistician living in Crofton, Md., had been buying insurance on the individual market since he left a government job in 2005. But with his premiums due to rise 40 percent from 2016 to 2017, he decided to go without. “That’s just an astonishing rate of growth,” he says. “That stunned me. For me, it’s the costs being out of control.” Viator, 61, has a condition that will require some orthopedic work on his hand, but he figures he’ll negotiate a cash price with doctors — and otherwise simply wait it out until he qualifies for Medicare in 4 years. Brian, a 60-year-old business owner who lives near Ft. Lauderdale, is also looking ahead to the moment he qualifies for Medicare — but with a lot more trepidation. His wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and requires costly medication, so going without insurance isn’t an option. Monthly premiums for the two of them have risen from about $1,800 per month in 2014 to $3,140 per month this year — a 74 percent increase during that time, or 19 percent per year. Including deductibles, the cost of insurance is about $31,000 per year. “That’s a crazy amount of money,” says Brian, who asked that we not use his last name. Paying that much for insurance leaves less to put into retirement funds or invest back in his business, and fellow business owners he knows face the same crunch. “We don’t have any buying power as a group,” Brian says. “We feel like we’re underheard and underrepresented. Nobody talks about it any more.” The big fight in Congress last year wasn’t about solving the problem of runaway costs that millions of Americans face. That battle was strictly about killing Obamacare, which would have checked a Republican wish-list item but also would have axed insurance for millions, while doing little to rein in costs. Three Republican-led efforts to kill Obamcare failed. Obamacare is, in fact, partly to blame for the predicament individual insurance buyers face. By establishing minimum coverage levels and phasing out subsidies at certain income levels, the 2010 law left an island of consumers in the individual market uniquely vulnerable to rising costs. But the law also did a lot of good, and repealing it outright would leave 20 million people or so without insurance. The Trump administration made two changes last year that will probably affect insurance and medical costs in the future — but not favorably. The tax cuts President Trump signed in December included a repeal of the individual mandate requiring all Americans who can afford health insurance to purchase it. That will save money for people who choose not to buy insurance, provided they don’t get sick or hurt. But it will probably push premiums even higher for individual insurance purchasers, because there will be fewer healthy people in the insurance pool and a larger portion of sick people requiring costly care. Inevitably, those hikes in premiums and out-of-pocket costs will flow to the individual market. Trump also plans to allow the sale of “association health plans,” which tend to offer stripped-down benefits at a lower cost than typical plans. That could lower costs for some, but these plans are controversial because they’ve been associated with fraud in the past. They could also siphon off healthy consumers from broader insurance pools, which, again, would push rates higher for those who remain. There are better ways to address spiraling costs. The U.S. system is riddled with middlemen and incentives that reward the amount of care provided, rather than the effectiveness of care. There are many sound ideas for how to better control costs, if Congress were interested in real solutions. The government could even provide last-resort catastrophic care to those who can’t afford a traditional policy but want minimal coverage in case of disaster—an idea once backed by conservative icon Milton Friedman, but rejected now by conservatives seemingly opposed to any government role in anything. For the time being, meanwhile, health reform in the United States is more likely to go backward than forward. Confidential tip line: rickjnewman@yahoo.com. Encrypted communication available.

Google Searches For 'World War 3' And 'Trump War' Hit All Time High,"More people are using Google to look up the phrase “World War 3” than ever before, the online giant has revealed. Searches for the terms “Trump War” and “Nuclear War” have also soared during the past few weeks as global concern appears to rise over Syria, North Korea and Afghanistan. Google began tracking enquiries on its search engine in 2004. The graph below demonstrates how the above mentioned phrases have fared since then: Other popular searches include “Syria World War 3,” “Going To War” and “Russia US War.” The escalation in war-related searches comes just weeks after President Donald Trump took office, and follows several developments in American foreign policy. On April 6, the U.S. launched 59 missiles toward a Syrian airfield in response to a chemical attack that Syrian President Bashar Assad allegedly ordered. Two days later, a Navy strike group moved toward the Korean peninsula, reportedly over concerns over North Korea’s weapons program. On Thursday, Trump ordered the dropping of America’s biggest non-nuclear bomb (dubbed “the mother of all bombs”) in Afghanistan to combat the self-styled Islamic State terror network.",TECH,TECH
How Much Time Do You Waste In Meetings?,"Meetings can be effective tools for entrepreneurs, but only if you use them effectively. Meetings are designed to gather employees, partners, and leaders for mutual communication and collaborative work, but too many meetings end up wasting time. Instead of spending an hour trying to resolve an issue, you end up spending 20 minutes making small talk, 10 minutes gathering materials, 10 minutes talking about the problem, and 20 minutes talking about something off-subject. Overall, meetings waste countless hours of your time, but aren’t they a necessary evil? It’s hard to run a business without at least some meetings, but you can make your meetings more productive by doing the following: 1. Choose the right people. Don’t invite everybody on the team. Only invite the people who are truly significant to the problem at hand. Anyone outside those parameters won’t be able to contribute much. 2. Have a point. Why are you holding this meeting? What goal are you trying to accomplish? Make sure your attendees realize this. 3. Set an agenda. Your employees should know exactly why you’re having this meeting, and what you hope to accomplish in it. Make sure everyone has a copy of the agenda ahead of time. 4. Set a strict time limit. It seems like an hour would be better than 15 minutes, but odds are, you’ll get more done in 15 minutes, since you’ll have the pressure of the time limit to keep you on task. 5. Elect a meeting leader. Someone should be in charge of keeping the meeting on task. It could be you or another employee. With these practices in place, you’ll waste far less time in meetings―and you’ll get more done while you’re in them.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
South Korea Touts Idea Of Co-Hosting 2021 Asian Winter Games With The North,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - A South Korean province is considering a proposal to co-host the 2021 Asian Winter Games with North Korea in a bid to strengthen inter-Korean ties, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Saturday, quoting provincial governor Choi Moon-soon. Gangwon province, host for the current 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, is considering the idea also as a way of making further use of Olympics venues, Choi was quoted as saying. North Korea is participating in the Pyeongchang Games at the invitation of the South, which is using them to help ease tensions between the two countries, still technically at war. The host city for the 2021 event has not been decided yet. A spokesman for South Korea’s sports ministry said it “hopes to continue sports exchanges with North Korea after the Winter Games” but it had not yet discussed any bid for the 2021 Games. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who held talks with top North Korean officials at Pyeongchang at the start of the Games, said on Saturday there was also a growing understanding of the need for talks between the United States and North Korea. Washington has been pursuing a policy of isolating North Korea and exerting maximum pressure on the reclusive state to persuade it to drop its nuclear and missile weapons program. “Talks between South and North Korea are making significant progress ... Meanwhile, a shared understanding of holding talks between the United States and North Korea is growing,” Moon told reporters in Pyeongchang. ″(I) hope the inter-Korean talks could lead to talks between the U.S. and North Korea and also denuclearisation talks.” Last week, Moon met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, who delivered an invitation for Moon to attend a summit in North Korea “at an early date”. Moon said it was premature to talk about when a summit could take place. “There is a high expectation of an inter-Korean summit, but people seem to be getting a bit ahead of themselves,” he added. About the possibility of co-hosting the 2021 Asian Winter Games, the Gangwon governor said he would start mapping out details once the Olympic Games end and that the proposal would also utilize North Korea’s Masikryong ski resort. Prior to the Winter Olympics, the two Koreas held a joint training program at the Masikryong resort. The proposal, if put forward, would need approval from South Korea’s unification ministry. A unification ministry spokeswoman said it had no immediate comment. Choi could not be immediately reached for comment, but his office said the issue had not been discussed and was the governor’s personal opinion.

Facebook Tightens Rules On Who Can Cash In On Ads,"COLOGNE, Germany, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Facebook has tightened its rules on who can make money from advertising on its network, responding to criticism that it is too simple for providers of fake news and sensational headlines to cash in. The world’s largest social network implemented the new standards with immediate effect to make it clearer which publishers can earn money on Facebook and with what content. The new standards coincided with an appearance by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in Germany, one of Facebook’s toughest critics on hate speech and safeguarding privacy. Facebook, together with Alphabet’s Google, accounts for around two fifths of internet advertising, which is forecast by consultancy Zenith to grow by 13 percent to $205 billion this year – overtaking television as the biggest channel for companies to pitch their wares to consumers. Marketing executives have criticized Facebook for failing to ensure that the digital ads distributed to its more than 2 billion active users reach their intended audience. It has also drawn criticism from major advertisers for inflating its audience figures and not adequately tracking ads, which were sometimes placed alongside content detrimental to the brands being promoted. On Wednesday, Facebook said it would seek accreditation from the Media Ratings Council, a U.S. non-profit organization, for audience measurement services. “We take very seriously our responsibility to earn and maintain the trust of people in businesses,” Sandberg told dmexco, a major digital marketing gathering in Cologne. “We hear their concerns about safe environments, about standards, about measurement, and this is critical to us,” she said. “We’re working hard to roll things out that give you more control over where your ads run, and more knowledge about where your ads run, before, during and after campaign.”   To make money on Facebook in future, content creators and publishers will have to comply with its so-called community standards, which seek to ensure that content is authentic, not offensive and adheres to its guidelines. Those publishing content flagged as misinformation or false news may be ruled ineligible to profit from Facebook, as would creators of clickbait and sensationalism, according to the rules seen by Reuters. Facebook’s guidelines for monetisation give broad definitions of content that would be disallowed – including “family entertainment characters engaged in violent, sexualised, or otherwise inappropriate behaviour”. Also covered are depictions of death, casualties and physical injuries in tragedies such as natural disasters; and content that is incendiary, inflammatory, demeaning or disparaging towards people or groups. Facebook said it will provide post-campaign feedback to advertisers that clearly identifies the publishers that ran their ads. Facebook will also step up its monitoring of hate speech, adding 3,000 content reviewers to nearly double the size of its existing team, Senior Vice President for Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson said in a blog post. “As soon as we determine that content has breached our community standards, we remove it. With a community as large as Facebook, however, zero tolerance cannot mean zero occurrence,” she said. Germany has led the way in demanding action on hate speech. Its parliament passed a law in June to introduce fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) for social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly.   (Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Emma Thomasson and Keith Weir)",TECH,TECH
Watch A NASA Booster Nozzle Plug Get Blown To Bits,"This may look bad to the untrained eye, but don’t worry — NASA says it’s on purpose. The space agency has released slow-motion footage of a June 28 test run in Promontory, Utah, showing a booster for its new rocket, the Space Launch System. The device fires up to a whopping 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit, obliterating the booster’s nozzle plug. Or as NASA calls it, “intentionally breaking apart.” The purpose of the nozzle plug is to prevent bad stuff like heat, dust and moisture from finding its way into the booster before it is set off. Following the test, fragments of the plug were found as far as 1,500 to 2,000 feet away from the ignition site.  NASA hopes that future missions of the Space Launch System will reach destinations such as an asteroid or Mars. ",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Massive 'Pillars Of Destruction' Show Stars Destroying Their Own Formation Clouds,"It’s an act of violence on a cosmic scale.  New images from the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile showed the massive “Pillars of Destruction” in the Carina Nebula, some 7,500 light years from Earth: The images revealed a “nursery” of new stars, which were wiping out the very clouds from which they formed.  “In an ironic twist, one of the first consequences of the formation of a massive star is that it starts to destroy the cloud from which it was born,” the ESO wrote in a news release.  That destruction led to scenes that looked like the cover of a 1960s psychedelic album. Some of the nicknames even sounded like the titles of those albums, such as the Mystic Mountain, a formation of gas and dust that spans more than three light years:  The pillars were being attacked from both inside and out, according to the ESO. Inside the pillars, newborn stars were emitting jets of gas, which were the rays that seemed to be coming from the peaks of the pillars. On the outside, they were slammed with the intense light of newly-formed stars nearby.  The new images and animations were taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer by a team of researchers led by Anna McLeod, a doctoral student at ESO studying how massive stars influence their environment.  “These pillars might look dense, but the clouds of dust and gas which make up nebulae are actually very diffuse,” ESO stated. “It is possible that the radiation and stellar winds from massive stars actually help create denser spots within the pillars, which can then form stars.” The new image was reminiscent of the famous “Pillars of Creation” image from the Eagle Nebula captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.   See more images of the Pillars of Destruction below.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Here's What New York City's Boroughs Should Look Like If They Were Redrawn Today,"The boroughs of New York City — The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island — have existed in their present form since the consolidation of New York City in 1898. In the interim 119 years, the city has radically transformed; the individual boroughs are now inter-connected in ways that would have been unimaginable at the time of their formation. A vast network of bridges, tunnels and the largest rapid transit system in the world connect the populations, establishments, and institutions of each borough — to say nothing of the connections enabled by the explosion of digital and mobile technologies. In this article we explore what happens when we abandon this century-old partitioning and remap the city to reflect the realities of New York City in 2017. Using data from dozens of different sources and techniques from a wide range of technologies and disciplines including computer vision, natural language processing, statistics, machine learning, network science, topology, architecture and urbanism, we constructed a new partitioning of the city that resonates with our contemporary moment — 5 boroughs for the 21st century. Formation of the Boroughs When New York City was consolidated in 1898, forming a city of 3.4 million, the term ‘borough’ was adopted to describe the five constituent areas brought together under the consolidation. Each borough was represented by a ‘borough president’, an elected officer who sat on the New York City Board of Estimate, an 8-member governing body responsible for budget and land-use decisions which also included the Mayor, the Comptroller and the President of the New York City Council. Connection of the Boroughs With the exception of Queens/Brooklyn, all boroughs are separated from one another by water. The implications and limitations of this physical partitioning of land have changed considerably since the initial formation of the boroughs. New York City is now connected by over 2000 bridges and tunnels, the vast majority of which were built after 1898. The formation of the boroughs also predated the opening of the New York City subway system by 6 years. The ambition to connect the boroughs of NYC via subway was made clear in the naming of the first subway company to operate in the city: The Interborough Rapid Transit Company. From its first day of operation (when it transported over 150,000 passengers) to it’s current status as the busiest rapid transit rail system in the western world, the New York City Subway has had a radical impact on the life of New York City and the mobility of its denizens. Disenfranchisement of the Boroughs as a Unit In 1989 the Supreme Court unanimously declared the NYC Board of Estimate to be unconstitutional. This decision was made on the grounds that Brooklyn (pop: 2,504,706 according to the 2010 census) had no greater representation than Staten Island (pop: 468,730), thereby violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. In the wake of this decision, the NYC Board of Estimate was abolished, and most of its governing responsibilities were transferred to the New York City Council, which consists of members drawn from a much more granular partitioning of the city with 51 council districts distributed (unevenly) across the 5 boroughs. Thus, while the constituent council districts of a borough have substantial political power in the New York City government (via their representative council members), the boroughs as a unit have far less political significance. We formed Topos earlier this year to advance the understanding of cities through the interconnected lenses of data and artificial intelligence. While there are well-known tools such as the United States Census that use manual techniques to collect information about different locations, using data and AI enables a dynamic, highly granular, and globally scalable understanding of place — an understanding we think is valuable given the rapidly evolving nature of cities and neighborhoods around the world (the US Census, for example, takes place every 10 years, divides the country into 9 regions, and only covers the US). Furthermore, we were interested in going beyond more familiar demographic viewpoints to capture the personality of a place, and what it feels like to actually be there. In a sense, we’ve developed a ‘psychographics’ of neighborhoods. As part of this endeavor, we have constructed a suite of features and indices about neighborhoods and cities that encompasses everything from topological analysis of urban form, to ambient light levels, to the prevalence of craft cocktails within a neighborhood. From this starting point, we decided to re-envision what a five borough partitioning of NYC might look like in 2017 using techniques from Artificial Intelligence: vector construction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Looking at our new 5 borough mapping of New York, one thing is immediately clear: geographic boundaries and proximities are much less important than they were in the original boroughs. With the exception of the green cluster, all other clusters are spread across a minimum of 3 of the original, geographically defined boroughs, and divided by at least one body of water. There is also a clear pattern of concentric rings radiating from downtown Manhattan, despite the fact that we didn’t include commute time or distance to transport hubs as an input. In this sense, geography reasserts itself as an organizing principle of the new boroughs. On average, we find the following distances to the center of downtown Manhattan: Average distances to the center of downtown Manhattan This striking pattern of concentric, differentiated rings resonates with the formal organization of Ernest Burgess’ Urban Land Use Model, though it differs in the specific substance of the concentric rings. Alongside commuter distance, explicit economic indicators such as income, housing and rental prices were not included in our input data. Despite this, there are clear, dramatic differences that emerge when economic data is aggregated to the cluster level, with the Median Household Income of cluster 1 (101,555 USD) almost triple that of cluster 4 (35,828 USD). Given the intertwined nature of commute time and income inequality, it is perhaps unsurprising that capturing one of these factors implies the other. Heavily built up, Vertical borough, Highest establishment density The smallest of the new boroughs as measured by both population and area, Minhattan is also the densest in several regards. In addition to being the most densely populated (with 69k residents/square mile), Minhattan has a higher density of most types of establishments (from museums to nightclubs) than any other borough. Alongside this incredible commercial, institutional and population density there is a corresponding absence of the natural world. While the collection of neighborhoods brought together in Minhattan are tightly bound by geography, it is also interesting to consider the close-by neighborhoods that are excluded. In particular, Riverside South (Trump Place) stands apart from Minhattan (For a more in-depth discussion of the singular nature or Riverside South within the context of Manhattan’s westside, see our article Rethinking ‘distance’ in New York City) Expensive, Commuter-oriented The Ring tightly hugs Minhattan, and on average is the closest borough to the center of Minhattan, with housing prices to match: after Minhattan, it is the most expensive borough to buy a house in. Unlike Minhattan, The Ring spans multiple rivers. It also unites isolated neighborhoods embedded in other boroughs that are quite far from the center of The Ring such as Forest Hills, Inwood and Hudson Heights. In general, The Ring has high densities across a range of establishments, and is the second densest borough after Minhattan. Half of NYC’s residents live in North Bend and South Bend, with 27.6% of the population living in the North Bend and 22.6% in the South Bend. They share remarkably similar average distances to downtown Manhattan, with South Bend neighborhoods an average of 7.92 miles away and North Bend neighborhoods an average of 7.86 miles away. North Bend is more densely populated than South Bend (46,694 residents/square mile vs 33,367 residents per square mile) which may explain another aspect of what differentiates them: South Bend has a far higher frequency of noise and party complaints. Leafy, Suburban, Spread out The Meadows is farthest away from the heart of Minhattan, and is sparser than the rest of the city in every regard. There are 12,050 people per square mile (vs Minhattan’s 69,390, a nearly 600% increase). Coupled with this lack of urban density, the natural environment asserts itself more strongly in The Meadows, a feature we detect using image recognition technologies. Additionally, image recognition algorithms discern the frequent presence of traditional suburban style houses in The Meadows, revealing a side of New York City that is less frequently presented in depictions of the city. As with many new technologies, data and AI based partitioning can be used to both positive and negative ends. Enabling a new level of strategic gerrymandering and malapportionment is an undeniable risk. We also believe the cultural, ecological, institutional and architectural diversity of New York City is an incredible strength and should be celebrated. At the same time, understanding how groups of neighborhoods are connected by a common set of challenges, environmental conditions, spatial configurations, or cultures, enables a more informed, granular approach to the city — whether this means developing strategies to address noise pollution, deciding where to open a farmer’s market or finding an apartment. Furthermore, New York City is already divided. 119 years after their original formation, despite a significant diminution of political power within the New York City government, the boroughs of New York are semantic units that powerfully shape the way many people perceive the city — not to mention the rest of the world. At the least, we hope this data-driven partitioning challenges static simplifications of what ‘The Bronx’, ‘Brooklyn’, ‘Manhattan’, ‘Queens’ or ‘Staten Island’ means. New York City has changed radically over the past 119 years, and will continue to do so, as will cities across the world. In this regard, we end with a correction of the title — rather than ‘5 boroughs for the 21st century’, a more appropriately dynamic title would be ‘5 boroughs for June 19th, 2017’. This post is an abbreviation of an article originally published on Medium as a part of an ongoing series capturing different insights we generate while developing the Topos platform.

Is That Faux Fur Really Fake?,"From Mother Nature Network's Laura Moss: The Humane Society of the United States issued a consumer warning earlier this week, informing consumers that Kohl's was selling ""faux-fur"" handbags made with real fur.

HSUS investigators tested several styles of Nicole Lee Fabiola handbags advertised as having ""faux-fur trimming"" and discovered that the so-called fake fur was actually rabbit fur.

""Consumers should be aware that animal fur is still being sold as 'faux' by major retailers,"" Pierre Grzybowski, research and enforcement manager for the Fur-Free Campaign of The HSUS, said in a news release.

Selling animal fur as fake fur is a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act and carries a civil penalty of up to $16,000 per violation.

Mislabeling real fur — for example, claiming rabbit fur is mink fur — is nothing new. However, mislabeling real fur as faux is a relatively new development.

It might not seem to make business sense, but the demand for faux fur has increased as more people aim to shop cruelty-free. As manufacturers try to meet this demand, products are often mislabeled. In 2008, the HSUS discovered several faux fur coats sold at Neiman Marcus were actually made with fur from raccoon dog, a canid native to East Asia (and pictured at right).

The HSUS sued the retailer, and in 2010, Neiman Marcus paid a $25,000 penalty.

That same year, Neiman Marcus and other retailers, including Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Saks Incorporated and Lord & Taylor, were also found to be selling mislabeled faux fur. A settlement agreement was reached after the HSUS filed a lawsuit for false advertising.

Later in 2010, President Barack Obama signed The Truth in Fur Labeling Act into law, which closed a loophole that previously had allowed fur-trimmed garments to go unlabeled if the value of the fur was $150 or less.

The law also required that all fur garments be labeled not only with the name of the animal, but also the country where the animal was killed.

Despite these stronger regulations, each year the HSUS finds manufacturers and retailers violating the law.

In March, Neiman Marcus, Drjays.com and Revolveclothing.com settled federal claims that they had marketed raccoon, rabbit and mink fur as faux.

Another 2013 HSUS investigation discovered the sale of domestic dog fur in apparel at a New York retailer, which led to action by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

U.S. law prohibits the import or sale of dog and cat fur products, but many designers outsource manufacturing to such countries as China, where fur is cheap and no animal welfare laws are in place.

China is the largest fur exporter in the world and raises several species of animals — including domestic dogs and cats — for the fur industry.

More than 75 million animals, including rabbits, raccoon dogs, mink, bobcats, foxes and domestic dogs and cats, are killed annually worldwide to make fur products, according to the HSUS.

Unsure if that fur is real or faux? Read the HSUS's guide for how to tell real fur from fake fur.

Earlier this year, the HSUS and New York Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal visited a N.Y. Century 21 store and found many fur garments were mislabeled. Watch the hidden-camera video below.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
New York Bans Sex Offenders On Parole From Pokemon Go,"By Laila Kearney NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York will bar registered sex offenders on parole from playing Pokemon Go over concerns that the wildly popular virtual reality game could help sexual predators lure young victims, state officials said on Monday. Governor Andrew Cuomo has directed the New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to restrict the state’s 3,000 sex offenders on parole from using Pokemon Go and similar games, Cuomo’s office said in a statement. To enforce the rule, the state is requesting Pokemon Go developer Niantic, Inc to cross-reference a list of sex offenders provided by the state with its list of players. New York is also asking the company to remove locations, identified in the game as places where players can win special points, near offenders’ homes. Paroled sex offenders will be instructed by their supervisors that playing Pokemon Go or similar games is in violation of their parole, state officials said. Niantic and Nintendo Inc <7974.T>, which owns a large stake in the game’s publisher, The Pokemon Company, could not immediately be reached for comment. “Protecting New York’s children is priority number one and, as technology evolves, we must ensure these advances don’t become new avenues for dangerous predators to prey on new victims,” Cuomo said. “These actions will provide safeguards for the players of these augmented reality games and help take one more tool away from those seeking to do harm to our children.” Pokemon Go incorporates colorful animated creatures from Nintendo’s Pokemon universe into the real world using augmented reality and Google mapping technology. The game attracted 21 million active U.S. users in less than two weeks of its launch in July, leading to warnings about certain hazards. A feature of the game that allows users to lure characters or players for a fee to specific locations, appears to have the potential to be abused by predators, Cuomo said. The game has been blamed for illegal border crossing from Canada to the United States, prompted a U.S. senator to question the game’s maker over privacy concerns, and led to a series of robberies and injures. The game may also pose special risks to children as it encourages players to explore physical locations to win points. On its website, Niantic says users must comply with age restrictions and applicable laws to play its games. “You may use the services only if you are 13 years of age or older and capable of forming a binding contract and are not barred from using the services under applicable law,” it said.

How Pluto Got Its Giant Frozen Heart,"One of the first things NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft spotted on Pluto was its gigantic heart feature. Now, scientists believe they know how it formed.  The dwarf planet’s heart-shaped region is actually a whole lot of ice sitting at the bottom of a basin almost 2 miles deep in the Tombaugh Regio, which was named for astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. “The heart shape is to a large degree created by highly volatile nitrogen ice that unavoidably accumulates in the basin and forms a permanent reservoir of ice,” Tanguy Bertrand, lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature, told ResearchGate. Bertrand and his fellow researchers ran computer simulations of Pluto’s climate over the past 50,000 years and found that, over time, the basin trapped nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Since the atmospheric pressure was highest at the bottom of the basin, the nitrogen condensed into ice. “With our model, we also predict that atmospheric pressure is currently at its seasonal peak and will decrease in the next decades, while seasonal methane frosts will disappear,” Bertrand told ResearchGate.  That change could cause the heart-like feature to act like a real heart.  “The half-heart glacier lying inside is a really massive glacier, which is not impacted by the seasonal changes. It probably formed when the basin formed, and will remain there in the future,” Bertrand told Gizmodo. “However, it probably flows and retracts over a few hundreds of kilometers (like a heart beating) with time, eroding and shaping the mountains surrounding it.”",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

How Successful People Overcome Toxic Bosses,"Bad bosses contaminate the workplace. Some do so obliviously, while others smugly manipulate their employees, using them as instruments of their own success. Regardless of their methods, bad bosses cause irrevocable damage to their companies and employees by hindering performance and creating unnecessary stress. The stress your boss causes is bad for your health. Multiple studies have found that working for a bad boss increases your chance of having a heart attack by as much as 50%. Even more troubling is the number of bad bosses out there. Gallup research found that 60% of government workers are miserable because of bad bosses. In another study 69% of US workers compared bosses with too much power to toddlers with too much power.  The comparisons don’t stop there. Significant percentages of US workers describe their bosses as follows: Most bosses aren’t surprised by these statistics. A DDI study found that 64% of managers admit that they need to work on their management skills. When asked where they should focus their efforts, managers overwhelmingly say, “Bringing in the numbers”; yet, they are most often fired for poor people skills. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize toxic people—even those they report to. This is no easy task. It requires a great deal of emotional intelligence, a skill that top performers rely on. While the best option when you have a bad boss is to seek other employment, this isn’t always possible. Successful people know how to make the most of a bad situation. A bad boss doesn’t deter them because they understand that success is simply the product of how well you can play the hand you’ve been dealt. When that “hand” is a bad boss, successful people identify the type of bad boss they are working for and then use this information to neutralize their boss’ behavior. What follows are seven of the most common types of bad bosses and the strategies that successful people employ to work effectively with them. 1. The Inappropriate Buddy This is the boss who’s too friendly, and not in the fun, team-building sort of way. He is constantly inviting you to hang out outside of work and engages in unnecessary office gossip. He uses his influence to make friends at the expense of his work. He chooses favorites and creates divisions among employees, who become frustrated by the imbalance in attention and respect. He can’t make tough decisions involving employees or even fire those who need to be fired (unless he doesn’t like them). His office quickly becomes The Office. How to neutralize an inappropriate buddy: The most important thing to do with this type of boss is to learn to set firm boundaries. Don’t allow his position to intimidate you. By consciously and proactively establishing a boundary, you can take control of the situation. For example, you can remain friendly with your boss throughout the day but still not be afraid to say no to drinks after work. The difficult part here is maintaining consistency with your boundaries, even if your boss is persistent. By distancing yourself from his behaviors that you deem inappropriate, you will still be able to succeed and even have a healthy relationship with your boss. It’s important you don’t put up unnecessary boundaries that stop you from being seen as friendly (ideally, a friend). Instead of trying to change the crowd-pleaser and force him to be something he’s not, having him see you as an ally will put you in a stronger position than you could have anticipated. 2. The Micromanager This is the boss who makes you feel as if you are under constant surveillance. She thought your handwriting could use improvement, so she waited until you left work at 7:00 p.m. to throw away your pencils and replace them with the .9 lead mechanical pencils that have the “proper grip.” She has even handed back your 20-page report because you used a binder clip instead of a staple. The micromanager pays too much attention to small details, and her constant hovering makes employees feel discouraged, frustrated, and even uncomfortable. How to neutralize a micromanager: Successful people appeal to micromanagers by proving themselves to be flexible, competent, and disciplined while staying in constant communication. A micromanager is naturally drawn to the employee who produces work the way she envisions. The challenge with the micromanager is grasping the “envisioned way.” To do this, try asking specific questions about your project, check in frequently, and look for trends in the micromanager’s feedback. Of course, this will not always work. Some micromanagers will never stop searching for something to over-analyze and micromanage. When this is the case, you must learn to derive your sense of satisfaction from within. Don’t allow your boss’ obsession with details to create feelings of inadequacy as this will only lead to further stress and underperformance. Remember, a good report without a staple is still a good report. Despite your boss’ fixation on detail, she appreciates your work; she just doesn’t know how to show it. 3. The Tyrant The tyrant resorts to Machiavellian tactics and constantly makes decisions that feed his ego. His primary concern is maintaining power, and he will coerce and intimidate others to do so. The tyrant thinks of his employees as a criminal gang aboard his ship. He classifies people in his mind and treats them accordingly: High achievers who challenge his thinking are treated as mutinous. Those who support their achievements with gestures of loyalty find themselves in the position of first mate. Those who perform poorly are stuck cleaning the latrines and swabbing the decks. How to neutralize a tyrant: A painful but effective strategy with the tyrant is to present your ideas in a way that allows him to take partial credit. The tyrant can then maintain his ego without having to shut down your idea. Always be quick to give him some credit, even though he is unlikely to reciprocate, because this will inevitably put you on his good side. Also, to survive a tyrant, you must choose your battles wisely. If you practice self-awareness and manage your emotions, you can rationally choose which battles are worth fighting and which ones you should just let go. This way, you won’t find yourself on latrine duty. 4. The Incompetent This boss was promoted hastily or hired haphazardly and holds a position that is beyond her capabilities. Most likely, she is not completely incompetent, but she has people who report to her that have been at the company a lot longer and have information and skills that she lacks. How to neutralize an incompetent: If you find yourself frustrated with this type of boss, it is likely because you have experience that she lacks. It is important to swallow your pride and share your experience and knowledge, without rubbing it in her face. Share the information that this boss needs to grow into her role, and you’ll become her ally and confidant. 5. The Robot In the mind of the robot, you are employee number 72 with a production yield of 84 percent and experience level 91. This boss makes decisions based on the numbers, and when he’s forced to reach a conclusion without the proper data, he self-destructs. He makes little or no effort to connect with his employees, and instead, looks solely to the numbers to decide who is invaluable and who needs to go. How to neutralize a robot: To succeed with a robot, you need to speak his language. When you have an idea, make certain you have the data to back it up. The same goes with your performance—you need to know what he values and be able to show it to him if you want to prove your worth. Once you’ve accomplished this, you can begin trying to nudge him out of his antisocial comfort zone. The trick is to find ways to connect with him directly, without being pushy or rude. Schedule face-to-face meetings and respond to some of his e-mails by knocking on his door. Forcing him to connect with you as a person, however so slightly, will make you more than a list of numbers and put a face to your name. Just because he’s all about the numbers, it doesn’t mean you can’t make yourself the exception. Do so in small doses, however, because he’s unlikely to respond well to the overbearing social type. 6. The Visionary  Her strength lies in her ideas and innovations. However, this entrepreneurial approach becomes dangerous when a plan or solution needs to be implemented, and she can’t bring herself to focus on the task at hand. When the time comes to execute her vision, she’s already off onto the next idea, and you’re left to figure things out on your own. How to neutralize a visionary: To best deal with this type, reverse her train of thought. She naturally takes a broad perspective, so be quick to funnel things down into something smaller and more practical. To do so, ask a lot of specific questions that force her to rationally approach the issue and to consider potential obstacles to executing her broad ideas. Don’t refute her ideas directly, or she will feel criticized; instead, focus her attention on what it will take to realistically implement her plan. Oftentimes, your questions will diffuse her plan, and when they don’t, they’ll get her to understand—and commit to—the effort it’s going to take on her part to help make it happen. 7. The Seagull We’ve all been there—sitting in the shadow of a seagull manager who decided it was time to roll up his sleeves, swoop in, and squawk up a storm. Instead of taking the time to get the facts straight and work alongside the team to realize a viable solution, the seagull deposits steaming piles of formulaic advice and then abruptly takes off, leaving everyone else behind to clean up the mess. Seagulls interact with their employees only when there’s a fire to put out. Even then, they move in and out so hastily—and put so little thought into their approach—that they make bad situations worse by frustrating and alienating those who need them the most. How to neutralize a seagull: A group approach works best with seagulls. If you can get the entire team to sit down with him and explain that his abrupt approach to solving problems makes it extremely difficult for everyone to perform at their best, this message is likely to be heard. If the entire group bands together and provides constructive, non-threatening feedback, the seagull will more often than not find a better way to work with his team. It’s easy to spot a seagull when you’re on the receiving end of their airborne dumps, but the manager doing the squawking is often unaware of the negative impact of his behavior. Have the group give him a little nudge, and things are bound to change for the better.

Boxing Day Survival Guide For People With Bad Credit,"Boxing Day. It was once a day when the wealthy people would give a ""Christmas box"" to their servants. Today, we often just think of it as a day when we're surrounded by empty gift boxes, or when you have to run to the store to return unwanted gifts. It's also become a week-long shopping event with stores offering ""Boxing Week Sales"" to entice shoppers. For many people, the end-of-the-year prices are so attractive, and it's a great time to buy all the things you didn't get for Christmas. Unfortunately, for people with unhealthy credit, it can be a difficult time of year that could erase any gains you've made in your credit. Here are some tips to help you survive Boxing Day if you suffer from bad or unhealthy credit. •	Just because something is on special doesn't mean you should buy it. Remember: if you pay for it with your credit card, then fail to pay your credit card off right away, that lower ""on special"" purchase will suddenly cost a lot more... and more and more each month until you pay it off.
•	If you are going to take advantage of the sales, set a strict budget and stick to it, and perhaps even pre-plan which stores you will visit - if for no other reason than to make sure you can pay off your credit card bill when it arrives next month! If you're worried about whether you'll be able to stick to your credit-friendly budget then bring cash instead and spend only the cash you have.
•	Even if you think you're being ""credit savvy"" by making on-sale purchases, consider whether the item is something you need, and don't forget to add up the other purchases you make - from the gas you spend to get to the store, to the restaurant food you eat while you're shopping. There's nothing wrong with making these purchases but they can all risk your credit if you're not careful.
•	When you go out, limit the number of credit cards and identification that you bring. Bring only what you need and then, when you get home, check to make sure you still have it. Holiday crowds are a magnet to less-desirable people who will take advantage of the busy shopping season to steal identities (and ultimately ruin your credit for their gain.)

"A Year After Comey's Firing, Scope Of Mueller Probe Expands to Lawyer's Shell Company","WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer accepted millions of dollars in consulting fees through a Delaware-registered dummy corporation that was used to funnel hush money to a porn star.  What consulting, exactly, did Michael Cohen provide to entities including AT&T, a Swiss pharmaceutical giant and an investment firm run by the cousin of a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin? Did any of that money flow to Trump himself or pay off any of Trump’s personal obligations? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred questions about the shell company to Trump’s outside lawyers. Chief outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he didn’t know anything about it and suggested asking Cohen’s lawyer Stephen Ryan. And Ryan had little to say Wednesday. “Sorry, I’m not talking to reporters,” he said before hanging up. “It’s unbelievable,” said Robert Weissman, president of the open government group Public Citizen. “We don’t know enough, so I can’t tell you if it was a bribe. But the facts that we have fit what bribes look like.” One year to the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey over the bureau’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to get Trump elected, Cohen and his use of a limited liability company, Essential Consultants, is the latest branch of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to become public. The Swiss drug company Novartis said in a statement that it had been contacted by Mueller’s office and “cooperated fully.” It had paid Cohen $1.2 million for health care consulting, even though it says it realized early on that Cohen had no expertise in that area. Columbus Nova, the investment bank run by the cousin of Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, paid Cohen $500,000 for what it called “consulting fees.” “The half-million dollars came into the exact same bank account that was used to pay my client,” Michael Avenatti, who is representing Stephanie Clifford (aka porn actress Stormy Daniels), told HuffPost on Wednesday. Clifford is suing Cohen to break a “hush agreement” she signed days before the 2016 election promising not to talk about the affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. Her lawyer Avenatti has become one of Trump’s fiercest public antagonists in recent months. He sparked an avalanche of news coverage about Cohen’s consulting fees by releasing a summary of the payments Tuesday night on the internet. On Twitter, Trump’s favored medium of communication, Avenatti wrote: “Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have a lot of explaining to do.” But Giuliani, who took charge of Trump’s legal team last month, said whatever Cohen did with his shell company, it had nothing to do with Trump. “I don’t care what bank he used,” he said, adding that Mueller had now gone far afield of his original mandate. “This was supposed to be an investigation of whether there was Russian involvement in the election. This is not that.” One prominent Republican lobbyist said it was fairly common for lawyers close to politicians who get elected to high office to find new clients who suddenly want to hire them. “It’s the relationship that counts,” the lobbyist said on condition of anonymity. “There are lots of lawyers who live off of knowing someone.” Public Citizens’ Weismann agreed that who you know is often far more important than what you know in the world of lobbying and influence. Nevertheless, it was curious that Cohen did not use his existing business, Michael D. Cohen & Associates, to receive payments and instead used the LLC he formed in October 2016 to pay Daniels her $130,000 in hush money within days of its creation, Weismann said. “You would not expect a payment for advice and counsel to be run through a newly invented shell company rather than a standing business,” Weismann said. “In my experience, it is not part of the practice of most law firms.” Giuliani said it did not matter legally how Cohen chose to accept his payments. He added that even if Trump’s monthly retainer payments flowed through the same business entity or even the same bank account, there was nothing illegal about it. Moreover, what Cohen did was Cohen’s business, Giuliani said. “There’s not involvement of the president in any of that. We can’t be responsible for what Michael Cohen is doing.” Giuliani had once been the U.S. attorney for the same office that is now investigating Cohen. He later was elected mayor of New York. Giuliani did concede that he would not have been pleased if, as mayor, his personal lawyer had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to provide access to the mayor’s office. “I wouldn’t be happy about it. But I wouldn’t be investigated for it.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Samsung To Halt Global Sales, Exchanges Of Galaxy Note 7","By Se Young Lee SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> said on Tuesday it will ask all global partners to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note7 smartphones, further deepening the smartphone company’s recall crisis. Samsung, in a statement, said it was still investigating recently reported cases of fires in new Note7 devices. “Consumers with either an original Galaxy Note7 or replacement Galaxy Note7 device should power down and stop using the device,” the company said. Samsung’s decision to pull Note7s off the shelves for the second time in two months underscores the South Korean firm’s struggles to fix its problems. It had already recalled 2.5 million Note7s due to faulty batteries, but the latest reports of damage on the replacement devices is raising fresh doubts about the firm’s quality control abilities. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday Samsung had temporarily halted production of Note7s. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliott Kaye said in a separate statementSamsung was making the right decision by halting sales and exchanges of the device and also urged consumers to stop using all Note7s. The Korean Agency for Technology and Standards also said consumers should stop using Note7 phones and said it will work with Samsung on future steps.   (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Chris Reese and James Dalgleish)",TECH,TECH

"Samsung, U.S.: Stop Using Galaxy 7 Note Phones Over Fire Risk","SEOUL/NEW YORK  - A U.S. government safety agency and Samsung on Friday urged all consumers to stop using Galaxy Note 7 phones, which are prone to catch fire, and top airlines globally banned their use during flights. Following reports that the phones’ batteries have combusted during charging and normal use, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was working on an official recall of the devices and that users should turn them off in the meantime. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said it was working with the agency. It voluntarily issued a recall last week for 10 markets including the United States, and it was expediting shipments of replacement phones to customers. The U.S. government action heralds more fallout for the South Korean manufacturer, which may take a financial hit from the recall and lose customers who are concerned about the quality of its flagship phones. For Samsung, which prides itself on manufacturing prowess, the scale of the recall is expected to be unprecedented. Some 2.5 million of the premium devices have been sold worldwide, the company has said. Its shares closed down 3.9 percent on Friday. Samsung said users in the United States can exchange their phones for one of several models and receive a $25 gift card. “The cost of the recall is going to be astronomical,” said product liability expert and chief executive officer of Real-World Forensic Engineering, Jahan Rasty. “They have to compensate people, fix the problem and give them a revised version of the product that doesn’t have the same manufacturing or design defect. “The longer this story lingers, the more it will etch itself in people’s minds,” he said. One pain point is that the devices are now off limits in a typically high-use setting: aboard planes. Aviation authorities and airlines from North America to Europe and Asia have issued bans or guidance on the phones. On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said travelers should not use or charge them while in the air, or stow them in checked luggage. That prompted the world’s three largest airlines by passenger traffic - American, Delta and United - to start telling passengers at the gate and on board aircraft to keep the phones switched off until they deplane. While experts say the bans may be tough for airlines to enforce, they nonetheless may deter would-be customers of the Note 7 in addition to annoying existing customers. That’s because airlines have increasingly made movies and TV shows available free for streaming on smart devices in flight, to avoid the cost of installing new screens on seat-backs. For now, Note 7 customers are cut off from this entertainment. This is “a huge black eye for Samsung,” TECHnalysis Research President Bob O’Donnell said. Companies ranging from Singapore Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd  to Air France KLM SA  have instituted similar bans on the device. They are the latest in ongoing efforts in the airline industry to manage the use of lithium-ion batteries, which are known to combust and are used in many devices, from phones and laptops to toys. Top airlines banned hoverboards during the Christmas holiday season in 2015. Earlier this year, the U.N.’s aviation agency prohibited shipments of lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes. A January report from the FAA said at least 171 incidents of smoke, fire, extreme heat or explosion involving batteries have occurred since 1991. In some instances, they have caused emergency landings, as when a camera short-circuited and started a small fire in the overhead bin of an American Airlines flight in September 2013. Injuries were rare, the report said.

KB Home Cuts CEO's Annual Incentive Payment In Response To Vulgar Rant (UPDATE),"KB Home’s board of directors pledged Thursday to cut CEO Jeffrey Mezger’s bonus payment by 25 percent this year after he was recorded shouting insults at his neighbor Kathy Griffin. Mezger’s non-equity incentive plan compensation has ranged from $3 million to $4 million in recent years, meaning the penalty for his obscenity-laden tirade could be in the neighborhood of $1 million. KB Home’s first Securities and Exchange Commission filing on the subject said the company would cut Mezger’s “bonus” ― a penalty that would essentially be meaningless, since the CEO isn’t regularly paid a bonus ― and when he is, it’s a pittance compared with his annual compensation. But in a second SEC filing after markets closed on Thursday, the company clarified that by “bonus payment” it meant “non-equity incentive plan compensation payment.” That would deliver a much stronger blow to Mezger.  According to its 2016 shareholder report, KB Home last paid Mezger a bonus in 2014. That year, in addition to his total compensation package of $10,349,483, he was awarded a bonus of $125,000: A hypothetical 25 percent penalty on the $125,000 sum would amount to a deduction of $31,250, or just 0.3 percent of Mezger’s total compensation. KB Home didn’t respond to a request from HuffPost detailing the actual dollar amount of the penalty.   Earlier this week, HuffPost obtained and published an audio recording of Mezger shouting vulgarities at Griffin after she and her boyfriend reported an hourslong noise disturbance at Mezger’s house to the Los Angeles Police Department on Saturday. In the explicit recording below, Mezger calls Griffin a “bald dyke” and a “cunt,” among other things. “Mr. Mezger regrets losing his temper over a supposed noise complaint involving his three young grandchildren in his swimming pool around 8 p.m. on Saturday, while they were being supervised by their mother and grandmother,” KB Home told HuffPost in a statement regarding the audio recording. “He apologizes for the language he used, as it does not reflect who he is or what he believes.” In its filing with the SEC Thursday, KB Home called Mezger’s behavior “unacceptable and a negative reflection on KB Home.” Mezger has served as the company CEO since 2006. This article has been updated to reflect KB Home’s second SEC filing, which clarified the company’s definition of “bonus.”",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Are Anxiety Drugs Making Us Less Eager To Lend A Helping Hand?,"Antianxiety medications can be enormously helpful to people bedeviled by severe anxiety -- no doubt about that. But by tamping down anxious feelings, could it be that these so-called ""anxiolytic"" drugs are blunting our empathy and rendering us less willing to lend a helping hand to those in need? That's the word from the scientists responsible for a provocative new study showing that lab rats given a drug called midazolam (MDZ) were less willing than untreated control rats to help release a trapped cage mate. ""With the MDZ on board, they were unable to feel/catch/'contage' the trapped rat's distress and thus were not motivated,"" Dr. Peggy Mason, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Chicago and the leader of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. She called the finding ""really amazing,"" adding in a videotaped statement (above) that ""in the context of today's society, which is a highly medicated society, where lots of people are taking psychoactive drugs that might blunt their experience of negative affect, our results would suggest that that will also blunt helping."" That sounds scary. But is it really the case? Dr. Norman Sussman, a professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, isn't convinced. He said it's notoriously difficult to draw conclusions about humans from studies involving rodents or other animals. What's more, he said, midazolam is a powerful injectable drug that generally is used not for anxiety but as a sedative for surgical patients. ""In every way you look at it, this study is not relevant to clinical experience,"" he said. ""There are too many questions about why it was set up this way. You can't draw very much from this at all."" For the study, which was published June 8, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the researchers watched what happened when rats were placed inside a cage containing a rat trapped inside a clear plastic tube. Untreated (control) rats were quick to open the door to the restraint to free the trapped rat. But rats injected with the midazolam made no effort to open the door even though they could see and hear their trapped cage mate. It wasn't that the rats on midazolam were physically unable to open the restraint door. When it was chocolate chips instead of another rat inside the tube, the drugged rodents had no trouble opening the door to get at the treat. It was that they simply didn't care that the other rat was trapped. Mason said the new research might lead people to rethink their choices when it comes to coping with anxiety. ""One approach is to dull or dampen uncomfortable emotions and another approach is to learn to tolerate these unpleasant experiences,"" she said in the email. While drug therapy might be a good choice for people with crippling anxiety, others ""may want to take a different approach given this information."" But Dr. Dolores Malaspina, another professor of psychiatry at NYU, sounded a different note. In an email to HuffPost Science, she said that even if certain medications do blunt empathy, ""suffering from an anxiety disorder has an even greater disruptive effect."" In any case, Sussman said, good medical care requires doctors to prescribe anxiolytic drugs only in the case of severe anxiety. Whatever the takeaway from the new study, previous research suggests that psychiatric drugs may be messing with our empathy. The popular painkiller acetaminophen has been tied to a reduced ability to show empathy, and certain antidepressants have been linked to indifference. Whatever.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
House Dems Reportedly Plan To Release Thousands Of Russia-Linked Facebook Ads,"Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee reportedly plan to release details about 3,000 Facebook ads linked to the Russian campaign to influence the last presidential election. According to The Wall Street Journal, the files could be released as early as this week and may show images of the promoted material, which demographic groups were targeted and how many people saw them. “We have been in ongoing discussions with Facebook and hope to have the final redacted ads in our possession within a matter of days,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated. “As soon as we receive them, it is our intention to share them with the public.” In September, Facebook announced that it had been paid $100,000 to promote thousands of ads that were linked to the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency. Many focused on divisive political or social issues and were designed to sow division in the lead up to the 2016 election. Lawmakers released redacted copies of some of the advertisements last year that focused on immigration, same-sex marriage and gun control. Facebook later said more than 126 million people potentially saw the ads purchased by the Russians.  Schiff’s efforts come just a weeks after Republicans on the Intelligence Committee released a 250-page report that said they had uncovered no evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Democrats dissented, arguing that the investigation was not fully completed, just abandoned. Schiff said the termination amounted to “a great service to the president and a profound disservice to the country.” Lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter testified before Congress last October and November amid growing public outrage over the revelations; however, they initially frustrated lawmakers with their limited promises to improve monitoring of such content. Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress last month following the separate Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the mishandling of user data. He had previously expressed broad support for government regulation of the network: “The question isn’t, ‘Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?’ It’s ’How do you do it?”",POLITICS,TECH
Hundreds Protest In Cities Across U.S. For 'Poor People's Campaign',"Hundreds of people took to the streets in cities across the country on Monday, as part of a new movement seeking to challenge racism and poverty in America.  The Rev. William Barber II and the Rev. Liz Theoharis ― the two religious leaders spearheading The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival ― led dozens of demonstrators at a rally and march in front of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday afternoon.  Similar rallies were coordinated and held in front of state houses in over 30 states across the country, according to organizers ― from Tennessee to Massachusetts to California. Participants in D.C. sang out familiar chants from protests against racism and police brutality in recent years: “What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now.” Rev. Barber also led a variation on the chant: “What do we want? A living wage. When do we want it? Now.” Somebody’s hurting our people and it’s gone on far too long! We won’t be silent anymore! #PoorPeoplesCampaign pic.twitter.com/RNVzTciht0 Hundreds were arrested at the nonviolent rallies nationwide on Monday, according to organizers. In D.C., Barber, Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour, and dozens of others were arrested, with police leading them out of the street they were blocking in front of the Capitol to a cordoned-off area nearby.   The actions kicked off 40 days of planned demonstrations across the country by the campaign, which is meant to continue in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign, cut short when King was assassinated 50 years ago. The movement’s broad demands to lawmakers include “a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws,” an end to systemic racism and support for a “living” wage, according to a release. At Monday’s D.C. rally, the reverends called for government to support “accessible” housing, healthcare and public transportation, as well as relief from “crushing student debt.” More rallies are planned each Monday for the next six weeks, with a final gathering in D.C. on June 23 ― after which organizers hope participants will continue taking action in their own states to call for legislative changes. While the campaign is expressly not partisan and does not make endorsements, it does seek to mobilize voters to the polls in the 2018 elections, a spokesperson told HuffPost last month.  “We come not with a left agenda or a right agenda. We come with a moral agenda that cares for all people,” Barber said at the D.C. rally on Tuesday. A domestic worker at the rally gave an emotional speech about her struggles living in poverty, speaking in Spanish as someone translated in English.   “I work cooking and cleaning and make 11 dollars an hour. I have suffered depression and sometimes suicidal thoughts at the thought of my children living on the streets because we can’t afford rent,” the woman said, wiping away tears. “Systematic poverty that has been created, not because we’re lazy or don’t want to work, but because of politicians who block a living wage.” See what the demonstrations across the country looked like: We shall not be moved!

Snapchat's Bob Marley Filter Called Out For Being 'Digital Blackface',"Ever wanted to look like Bob Marley? Snapchat is now giving you the opportunity with a new filter. But some are criticizing the feature, calling it ""digital blackface."" Reached by The Huffington Post, a spokeswoman for Snapchat said that the filter was created in partnership with the Bob Marley Estate. ""[It] gives people a new way to share their appreciation for Bob Marley and his music,"" the spokeswoman said. ""Millions of Snapchatters have enjoyed Bob Marley's music, and we respect his life and achievements."" Be that as it may, a number of people are outraged by the filter, which adds dreadlocks to your head and makes your face appear darker and more angular. So... there's a Bob Marley @Snapchat filter. Blackface is now OK, apparently? i love how fun snapchat's selfie lenses are, but not when they're racist like today's blackface one or the bindi filter tied to coachella Snapchat creates literal blackface in celebration of 4/20?  https://t.co/mApZa1lyyJ Might call Snapchat's idea for a Bob Marley blackface filter ...(•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■)... half-baked YEAAHHHHhttps://t.co/ONjAeKsp2x Snapchat's half-baked 420 nod is a Bob Marley blackface filter?! Dude was Jamaican! Did waaaay more than smoke weed. pic.twitter.com/t6tazxnMxT Someone at Snapchat: ""So, how do we *scale* blackface?"" The list goes on and on. The spokeswoman for Snapchat did not respond when HuffPost asked about whether the filter would remain as an option. It was introduced on April 20, or 4/20, a national holiday of sorts for stoners. It's likely to be temporary.  Snapchat also did not respond when asked by HuffPost about the diversity of its staff. The tech world is dominated by white people, with razor-thin margins occupied by African-Americans. Snapchat has repeatedly declined to release numbers about its workforce even as it accepts tax credits for diverse hires. Asked point-blank about diversity by journalist Walt Mossberg last year, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegal didn't offer much of an answer. ""Again, this is sort of the challenge, and I should have exact percentages for you but we just don’t think about diversity in terms of numbers that way. ... We think about people and diverse skill sets,"" Spiegal said in part. If Snapchat's peers are any indicator, Spiegal might be less inclined to ""think about diversity in terms of numbers that way"" because the numbers are terrible. Facebook is 55 percent white and 2 percent African-American, for example. Twitter is similar, as are LinkedIn and Google. Snapchat might be much more diverse, but we don't know because the company won't tell us -- which sets it apart from its peers in the social media space. This is exactly why Snapchat should think about diversity ""in terms of numbers"" and not ""skill sets."" It goes without saying that you are less likely to offend groups of people if they are represented in your workplace, where you interact with them every day. Or at least, it should go without saying. But diversity advocates are forced to make this point time and time again. They make it when Facebook employees cross out Black Lives Matter slogans and when Microsoft has dancing women entertain people at a party.  And yes, they're making that same point now. Why extreme empathy and team diversity is so important in startups: https://t.co/6KHugIpGVP by @franticnews So im guessing @Snapchat doesn't have a a diversity & inclusion team based on today's filter. #whoapprovedthiscreative Not going to say that increasing diversity in tech is a panacea, but crap like what happened w/ Snapchat today would be a lot less frequent. I think we might need more diversity in Silicon Valley, possibly https://t.co/CYw8V4eynw",TECH,TECH
Norovirus Outbreak At Winter Olympics Prompts Military Response,"The Winter Olympics in Pyeonchang, South Korea, are already stomach-churning ― and the competition hasn’t even started yet. The host country has called in the troops after pulling 1,200 civilian security guards from duty amid a norovirus outbreak, according to outlets. Lee Hee-beom, chairman of the Pyeongchang Olympics organizing committee, said Tuesday that the civilian guards will be sequestered until it is determined that they are “well,” CBS News reported. Dozens of guards were already hospitalized Sunday for sudden vomiting and diarrhea. “The military personnel ... will be responsible for security checks of the 20 venues as they take up jobs such as security searches, previously done by civilian safety personnel, until the patients’ condition is normalized,” a statement Monday from the Olympics committee said, per CNN. The infected guards were in stable condition, the statement said, and all Olympic living quarters and buses were being sterilized. The 41 security guards diagnosed with the easily transmitted virus were staying in the same building, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said Monday. “KCDC dispatched an immediate response team to the Pyeongchang site to check additional people for symptoms, check the origin of the exposure, take measures to control infection and prevent spread,” the statement sent to media said. As of Tuesday morning, officials still had not determined the origin of the norovirus. But, CBS noted, they are focusing their investigation on food and water sources at the facility where the guards resided. They are also inspecting other facilities that rely on groundwater. According to the CDC, you can contract norovirus by drinking contaminated liquids, touching contaminated surfaces and putting fingers in your mouth, or having contact with someone who is infected ― for example, sharing a fork. Competition begins Wednesday and the opening ceremony is Friday.",SPORTS,SPORTS
It Is Time To Come Together And Finish What Colin Kaepernick Started,"It is hard to deny that Colin Kaepernick picked an excellent method to raise awareness to racial inequalities and injustice in the United States of America. NFL players kneeling during the national anthem reached an all time high last week. The nation erupted into a national debate after President Donald Trump stirred the pot on Twitter. With Colin Kaepernick no longer in the NFL, we must finish what he started. In order to move forward, we must listen to our fellow Americans. Not listen to respond, but rather listen to understand. Once we understand why people are doing certain things we can move forward. We need to understand that while the protesting method may be disrespectful in some people eyes it was a desperate call for a desperate measure. We must each ask ourselves what is going on for these fellow Americans to use these tactics as a call for help. We also need to understand that history isn’t the same for every citizen. It is easy to say that demonstrators are disrespecting the military since they fought for freedom and defended the flag and that has become the main focus of the debate. With that thought in mind, civil rights activists are equally American heroes who fulfilled the national anthems lyrics by making this country the land of the free for everyone. Many of these heroes paid the ultimate price fighting for their rights. Without these heroes black people would not be able to attend the same schools as everyone else, marry outside of their race, drink out of the same fountains, use the same bathrooms, vote without intimidation, and sit in the front of a bus. When we honor the American flag and national anthem we must honor all American heroes and anyone who has fought for American freedom and values in addition to the military. We must understand our history and how it has shaped the landscape of our country. If we listen and try to understand the rest will take care of itself. This is the first step to working together as one united nation. “You have to know the past to understand the present.” - Carl Sagan Below is the first interview Colin Kaepernick explaining why he didn’t stand for the anthem.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Spotify Hits A Major New Landmark,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish music streaming service Spotify said on Monday its user base had grown to 100 million, up from 75 million previously, as it pushed into new markets and despite competition from the likes of Apple Music.

Ex-Convict Don Blankenship Loses To Patrick Morrisey In West Virginia Senate Race,"Patrick Morrisey is President Donald Trump’s new man in West Virginia. The Mountain State Republican won a heated primary on Tuesday, defeating U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and Don Blankenship, the former coal baron who mounted an insurgent campaign for the nomination after emerging from a year in prison following his conviction for conspiring to violate mine safety laws. Morrisey, who has served as the state’s attorney general since 2013, picked up support early in the race from the party establishment. In a victory speech, Morrisey said that “for too long the Washington elites have looked down on West Virginia and our values.” “Our victory will ensure that West Virginia rises again,” he said.  Thank you West Virginia. Now it’s onto defeating Liberal Joe Manchin in November.  #wvsen https://t.co/IlFqJZIoBC pic.twitter.com/5CfZL74nTT In the days ahead of the vote, with internal polls showing Blankenship surging, the establishment mounted a last-minute effort to make sure he didn’t become the nominee. Blankenship was the chief executive of Massey Energy when the company’s Upper Big Branch mine exploded in 2010, killing 29 miners. President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday to urge voters in West Virginia to reject the former coal executive, saying Blankenship “can’t win the General Election” in November. To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey! Responding to Trump’s tweet, Blankenship predicted on Monday that he would not only win the primary but that he would “beat Joe Manchin even without the support of the establishment.”  Instead, Morrisey will face two-term incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, the president’s most dependable Democrat in the Senate, who cruised to an easy victory Tuesday over progressive primary challenger Paula Jean Swearengin to secure the Democratic nomination. Despite voting in favor of the White House’s agenda 61 percent of the time, the president has targeted Manchin, the lone Democratic senator in a state Trump won by 42 percentage points in 2016 and remains extremely popular.  Trump first waded into the race last month at a roundtable event on taxes in White Sulphur Springs. Standing beside Morrisey and Jenkins, he called on voters to oust Manchin. Blankenship did not receive an invitation. “We have to get more Republicans in office,” Trump said. “You’re going to have a chance to get a senator that’s going to vote our program. That’s going to help you in so many ways.” Blankenship tried to paint Jenkins and Morrisey as establishment pawns, while mainstream Republican groups poured money into the race in hopes of keeping Blankenship off the ticket. Upper Big Branch had made Blankenship the face of greed and recklessness for many West Virginians. A group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aired anti-Blankenship advertisements, and McConnell prodded Trump to get involved and weigh in on behalf of Jenkins and Morrisey. Blankenship had dubbed McConnell “Cocaine Mitch” and created a firestorm when he referred to the Kentucky senator’s father-in-law as a “Chinaperson” and later defended his use of the racist term.  McConnell’s political team trolled Blankenship late Tuesday, posting a graphic of the senator in a cloud of cocaine with the words, “Thanks for playing, Don.”  Thanks for playing, @DonBlankenship. #WVSen pic.twitter.com/TV1ETgQdmu If Morrisey wins on Nov. 6, it would mark a milestone in the president’s takeover of what was once known as the bluest state in America. The state’s other senator, Shelley Capito, is a Republican who worked closely with the White House on rolling back environmental regulations to bolster coal. Last August, Gov. Jim Justice, a billionaire coal executive, announced his decision to switch parties and become a Republican at a rally with Trump. All three of the state’s U.S. representatives are Republicans. The GOP commands majorities in the state Senate and House of Delegates, and it controls five of six offices of the executive branch. But Morrisey faces a formidable opponent in Manchin. The 36-year veteran of West Virginia politics has served as governor and secretary of state and enjoys the advantage of incumbency and the biggest war chest in the race. Manchin handily defeated his primary opponent, progressive activist Paula Jean Swearengin, on Tuesday and raised nearly $6 million by last month. That’s far ahead of Morrisey’s $1.9 million. Vice President Mike Pence was among those who congratulated Morrisey on his victory. “The great people of [West Virginia] need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda,” he posted to Twitter.  Congratulations to @MorriseyWV on his victory tonight. @RealDonaldTrump and I look forward to working with him. The great people of WV need a senator who supports the #MAGA agenda.   Dave Jamieson contributed to this report. ",POLITICS,POLITICS
Not Like Food TV: Training Women Leaders In Culinary Entrepreneurship,"In the end, it doesn’t matter if your food is prepared by a male or female chef, as long as it is the best meal you have ever had. But it does matter if women in the culinary business are not let out of what Rohini Dey calls the “pink cage” of pastry chefs and line cooks in order to be innovators, entrepreneurs and leaders in the culinary industry. Dey, who founded the Women in Culinary Leadership program in 2012 through the James Beard Foundation, has a career in finance and restaurant entrepreneurship, and explains, “Unless you break out of that you will not leave the kitchen. You need to be in the thick of it, you need to know food costs, labor costs, inventory. And if women are not exposed, women are shut out.” Dey adds, “By creating this program five years ago to break through the barriers of the ‘gastro ceiling,’ the goal has been to build women’s operational skills, financial literacy, confidence, and networks in the field. Empowering women on a grassroots level to create tangible progress is more vital now than ever before; especially given the glacial change in women's leadership across all arenas, whether political or the boardroom or culinary.” With a masters in economics from the Delhi School of Economics and a doctorate in management science from the University of  Texas, Dey went to work at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., followed by a stint at McKinsey & Co., all before opening two award-winning restaurants in Chicago and New York, both named Vermilion. Now in its fifth year, the program Women in Culinary Leadership has mentored 42 women chefs, and this year’s class of 15 recipients was announced recently. More than 65 applicants with a background of two years or more in hospitality and the culinary arts, entered to participate in the eight-month mentor/grantee program with top industry leaders. The 15 who will continue hail from 10 states from Arizona to Utah, plus Washington D.C. “They come in raw, some may have a year in catering, but all walk out ready to be executive chefs,” Dey says. Matched with top chefs around the country (90 percent of whom are men, she says), the women are on the restaurant payroll and chefs mentor them “to give them a shot at succeeding” at the highest levels, Dey says. “Women need to know basic entrepreneurship skills and have financial literacy even if they don’t want to own a restaurant. They need to know cash flow, how to create a P & L statement, and they have to speak the language of the investors and vendors. Numbers are very powerful,” Dey says. Dey, who is a James Beard Foundation trustee, and Susan Ungaro, president of the James Beard Foundation, aim to help women build in-depth skills in the kitchen, restaurant management, and hospitality fields. “When I entered the culinary field, I found that women were concentrated in the lower rungs of the chef world. It made me irate,” says Dey, who in addition to her restaurant enterprise, is active in global philanthropy and mentoring as the founder of MSEDG-Educate Girls Globally, the American India Foundation, The Chicago Network, International Women’s Forum, the Women’s Forum of New York and 85 Broads. “Women are not giving the breathing room to succeed,” says Dey, who in her spare time competes in marathons, triathlons and has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. But that is changing. With the platform of the James Beard Foundation, founded in 1986, Dey says they have been building awareness of the need for women’s leadership and are “changing it at the industry level.” To further advance women in culinary leadership. The Women’s Entrepreneurial Leadership program, was launched for the first time this month with 20 women chosen from around the country for intensive leadership training and mentorship. “It has been very rewarding to watch the growth of our Women in Culinary Leadership Program, but our industry still has a long way to go to help women thrive in leadership roles,” says Susan Ungaro, president of the James Beard Foundation. Our newest one-week women’s entrepreneurial program at Babson College builds on previous successful programs to work toward our ultimate goal of significantly increasing the number of women owned restaurants and food businesses.” Developed and hosted at Babson College, the new initiative aims to help female chefs and owners grow their businesses by cultivating women’s leadership in the culinary industry. “Our Foundation has made promoting diversity and women in leadership in the food and restaurant business a priority.  Although women make up 50 percent of culinary school graduates, only 19 percent of executive chefs are female, and even fewer own their restaurants,” says Ungaro. The WEL curriculum will address advanced business and finance concerns related to entrepreneurship and expansion, as well as provide gender-specific training and leadership development. An emphasis on work/life balance and other cultural issues will also be part of the program. The JBF’s Women in Entrepreneurial Leadership Program also engages a group of mentors who agree to provide expertise and career development support to the participants on an ongoing basis once they leave the program. Occasional in-person meetings and webinars will be held throughout the year in order to grow the network of women leaders across the country. “We offer the hard skills, but also he softer skills like how to speak up, be more confident,“ Dey says. Her mantra, at the World Bank and McKinsey, where she says she did not face discrimination because she is “not a shrinking violet” is: “If you don’t ask, you don’t get.” The intention is to make the culinary industry an equal opportunity for both men and women. “It is imperative to have more women owning and operating thriving scalable businesses,” adds Jodie W. McLean, an initiator of the WEL program and the CEO of EDENS, one of the nation’s leading private retail real estate companies. “The benefits to an entire organization and industry when women are in executive leadership roles and impact policy are significant.  The culinary industry is not different than any other – gender equity isn’t about fairness; it’s about good business.” With many personal and professional sources of support, Dey says she gathers advice from people she respects both in and out of the industry. Dey writes in this advice in Swaay, “That only 2 percent of women owned businesses in the U.S. exceed the $1 million revenue mark is a tragic reality and waste of our potential as entrepreneurs. It’s also because women are least likely to venture out of financing through savings and remain too cash strapped to grow. Dream and plan big, to make miracles happen.” Her additional advice for any woman launching into a culinary career is to “live the dream first from the outside in, before you make the switch.” What she means is to work in the restaurant business for three weeks or so to see if it what you want. “the outside view is far more glamorous than the reality. It is not what food TV makes it out to be,” Dey says. “It’s laborious, hot, physical, grimy, tough and lonely in the kitchen. Ninety percent of restaurants are failures,” she advises.  Her best advice is to have tenacity. “Nothing is easy, but do not take no for an answer. Perseverance is about not giving up.” Her enterprises are huge successes. Vermilion was named best new restaurant by several outlets, including Bon Appetit, USA Today, Town & Country and Travel & Leisure. “I have made so many mistakes, including career choices that sometimes I wake up and say I want to create an empire. And some days I want to escape.” Dey adds, “I have two daughters and two restaurants and my life is a full plate,” says Dey. “At the end of the day you are your own team.” This post originally ran in Take The Lead.

Trump's Iran Deal Exit Is A Win For Russia,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal will weaken U.S. relationships around the world and create problems that U.S. foreign policy will be grappling with for years, but it’s also a boon for the U.S. rival that American intelligence said helped Trump get elected: Russia. Trump’s move will likely lead toward progress on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two chief goals: splintering the U.S.-led alliance of democratic powers that currently dominates global affairs and fortifying Russia’s alternative network, which includes Iran and its partners across the Middle East. A split between the U.S. and its three most powerful allies — France, Germany and the U.K. — was clear immediately after Trump’s announcement. The leaders of the latter three countries issued a joint statement expressing “regret and concern” and saying they want to sustain the Iran agreement, which promised Iran some freedom from international sanctions in exchange for limits on and guarantees of transparency about its nuclear development. They reiterated what Trump’s own military advisers and new secretary of state have said: Iran is abiding by the deal.  “America moves further away from our key allies, which has implications that are extremely important and detrimental,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), a prominent member of the House Armed Services Committee. The U.S. committed to the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, Germany, France, Russia, China and the U.K. All the other countries plan to stay in the accord. The U.S. and Europe have always had disputes. But the worry is that something fundamental is shifting.  Trump’s reneging on past U.S. commitments on Iran and climate change, along with his willingness to wage a trade war with Europe and continuously misrepresent NATO, has made it hard for America’s foreign partners to think he truly sees them as friends.  That the president made his Tuesday announcement despite warnings from his own party’s top national security voices and independent experts reminds other countries that they can’t assume that U.S. supporters of traditional diplomacy and international norms will be able to keep American relationships on track. The implicit promise of an experienced, largely bureaucratic foreign service is that it brings professionalism and longterm thinking to whatever policy an elected official wants to pursue ― and on Tuesday, U.S. diplomats didn’t even have a plan for next steps after Trump’s speech. The Europeans would prefer that the U.S. continue to operate as it traditionally did, said Federiga Bindi, a former official in the Italian government and a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies. “I think with [the Iran deal announcement] they start to see who Trump really is. The U.S. is never going to recover from that.” The Trump administration did try to soften the blow of the announcement. The president spoke of developing future Iran policy alongside foreign partners. And a White House statement said foreign companies that began work in Iran under the terms of the accord ― including some huge European firms ― would have a grace period to exit before potentially being hit with U.S. sanctions that Trump wants to reapply. But that only underscored how U.S. priorities now diverge from those of its longtime allies. European leaders are committed to the Iran deal because they believe it prevents the spread of nuclear weapons and they know Iran will not stay in unless it receives some economic benefit. So now those same leaders, Bindi said, must try to shield their companies from U.S. sanctions by, for instance, helping them create ways to do business in Iran that can’t be disturbed by American regulators. But there’s only so much time in the day. It’s unlikely that European officials will focus much on trying to craft the “better deal” Trump pledged, particularly because the president didn’t seem to care about the months of work they and their American counterparts put into negotiations for side agreements that he had suggested might help convince him to stay in the deal. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Putin began his fourth term in office this week with a chance to show that unlike the U.S., Russia does abide by international promises like the Iran agreement. The accord was useful for Russia because it wanted to avoid more countries gaining nuclear weapons and thereby making one of its own assets less valuable. “It never really was comfortable with Iran’s potential for breakout,” said Michael Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute in London. But a world in which U.S. credibility is in the gutter and the deal is in tatters is hardly a nightmare scenario for Putin. As the U.S. puts more economic pressure on Iran, the Islamic republic will find it harder to acquire friends. That leaves Tehran with Moscow. Though the two are uneasy partners, they have cooperated to combat international initiatives that might challenge their own interests. In Syria, for instance, they fight side-by-side and present a united front in global organizations to defend their mutual friend Syrian President Bashar Assad.  Hard-liners in Tehran want to deepen that relationship. In the process, they seek to boost the sense of righteous resistance to the West that keeps aggressive nationalism strong among their base and ensure that their country remains a Putin-style autocratic society, rather than gaining more exposure to the Western liberties that many ordinary Iranians have clamored for. A more isolated and paranoid Iran means “the Russians gain geostrategically,” said Reza Marashi, the research director at the National Iranian American Council and a former State Department official. The United States, he added, is helping reinforce a perception that the Russians want to strengthen: that today Washington may hold sway in the southern half of the Middle East, but the north ― including key areas in Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey ― is under Moscow’s influence. And that plays precisely into what Putin deeply desires ― to make Russia, 27 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, once again look like an equal to the U.S.",POLITICS,POLITICS

It's Time We Take A Look At How Female Astronomers Are Treated,"When Hidden Figures premiered in theaters this past December, it drew attention to a less discussed issue: The discrimination and sexism faced by women of color in the early days of the space race. The movie was based on a true story of three black women at NASA in the 1960s. Sadly, the challenges the movie addresses are far from over. In a study released this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research, researchers found that women of color in astronomy and earth sciences face a disturbing amount of harassment in the workplace. According to the survey of over 400 people in the two fields, women of color said they felt unsafe at work 40% of the time (28% of which they attributed to their race), while 18% said they avoided work events because of these concerns.  ""How do you become a fantastic scientist if you're not in the room to do science or learn science?"" Christina Richey, one of the study's authors and the former chair of the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy, told Refinery29. ""And how can we say that we're creating the next generation of the best scientists possible if we're creating an environment that also makes them feel too unsafe to attend an event?"" Richey said she has observed these issues in the workplace for years, but that when she has raised them with leadership, her superiors brushed them off as anecdotal. Now, with the stats to prove what she and many other women see, the issues won't be so easy to dismiss. The study notes how women of color have to deal with gender and racial discrimination, a ""double jeopardy."" ""When I started looking at the results, I realized that it wasn't just that the community wanted to discuss the issue, it was that we had serious, serious issues going on, and that the community was desperate for an outlet,"" Richey said. ""As someone who's worked on this issue for many years within this field and with these people, I know these respondents. I know their faces, I know their lives. They are my friends and my colleagues. I'll admit that I had a very stiff drink and cried myself to sleep that night [after I first looked at the results]."" Though we're used to hearing about the challenges women face in Silicon Valley, astronomy and earth sciences don't get as much attention. One key moment for this issue came up in 2015, when it was revealed that renowned astronomer Geoff Marcy had engaged in decades of sexual harassment. Richey said she feels the reality check that's happening in the tech industry at the moment, especially as the aftermath of Susan Fowler's Uber experience plays out, is overdue within the earth sciences and astronomy. While she says that the American Geophysical Union and American Astronomical Society have taken important steps to further the discussion around these issues, including holding a racism town hall, more needs to be done — especially in terms of research. In response to a request for comment on the study, a NASA spokesperson provided Refinery29 with the following statement: ""NASA does not tolerate sexual harassment, and nor should any organization seriously committed to workplace equality, diversity and inclusion. Science is for everyone, and any behavior that demeans or discourages people from fully participating is unacceptable. The agency takes very seriously its obligations, both legal and ethical, to make sure that when it provides federal dollars to a STEM educational program that the program is extending equal opportunity to all of its participants."" If we're going to make strides in space and science, we definitely need women. Making sure these women feel safe at work should be a guarantee, not an uncertainty.

Can Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal Make the Big Oil Lawsuit Go Away?,"Last week, Garret Graves, speaking for Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, told the nominating committee for the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East that the Governor would refuse to approve the reappointment of John Barry and Tim Doody should the committee recommend the two currently serving commissioners. The surprisingly candid announcement came from Graves in a public meeting in response to a lawsuit that the SLFPA-E filed against 97 oil, gas and pipeline companies demanding that the industry repair the damage it did to Louisiana's coastal wetlands. Doody is president of the SLFPA-E and Barry is vice president and the chief spokesperson for the suit filed in July. According to the suit, the wetlands loss has increased the intensity of the storm surge and raised the cost of maintaining levees and floodwalls which are responsibility of the Authority East.  The reaction from the Governor's office was swift and stinging, but held few meaningful objections. The protest started out with personal attacks on the members of the Flood Authority and the trial lawyers. The goal of the lawsuit, said Graves, is fame for the commissioners filing the suit and windfall of money for the trial lawyers. Personal attacks are usually a sign of a weak case. Then objections evolved to non sequiturs. For example, Graves has claimed that the suit deflects attention away from the culpability of the Army Corps of Engineers, a claim that only obscures the issue at hand, namely that the oil and gas industry is responsible, according to the experts, for more than a third of the damage.  As noted by Barry, the Governor has failed to provide an answer as to what Big Oil is providing to Louisiana that is so valuable that we should turn a blind eye to the the degradation of our storm surge-killing wetlands.  So now, it appears that Governor Jindal plans to control the nominating process by appointing to the Flood Authority East only those who are opposed to the lawsuit. Well, if the Governor can control the process, why can't the nominating committee control it? There are probably ways this can be done, but first a little history. After Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the Army Corps of Engineers' levees and canal walls, there was a prompt reaction from local citizens and elected officials. The widely held presumption was that the commissioners of the Orleans Levee Board were not paying attention to flood protection and were therefore, partly responsible for the flood disaster. Federally appointed experts eventually absolved them of wrongdoing, but in 2005, the OLB and other levee districts were presumed guilty and this prompted the One Levee Board campaign to garner statewide support for a new paradigm of levee board governance. In his fifteen minute speech, Graves quite correctly told the eleven gentleman and one lady that the new levee board legislation was about removing distractions from the commissioners so they could focus on flood protection and also about replacing parochial parish flood control with regional multi-parish flood control. These things are true. But the legislation as written, said Graves, was not about insulating the levee boards from politics. This is also true. In 2006, the mantra of ""no more politics"" was a rally cry, an advertising slogan. It was not a legislative directive. Furthermore, though few are aware, the legislation establishing the new levee board paradigm was the first ever in the country. No other state in the nation had similar legislation governing its levee boards which means the legislation had to be written from scratch. ""I made it up,"" said then Senator Walter Boasso from St. Bernard Parish in an email to the author. ""There was no state model that we had taken this from."" While a direct causal link between the actions of the pre Katrina levee boards and the catastrophic flooding has not been established, no one denies that the new legislation was needful and beneficial. In addition to creating regional governance, the legislation required commissioners to have professional experience including hydrology, engineering and civil engineering. The spirit of the new paradigm was deftly described by Representative Tim Burns who actively supported SB 8 and SB 9 which created the Authorities East and West. In a February 27, 2006 email to his constituents, he wrote that the legislation was a ""monumental step forward in centralization, unity, professionalism and coordination of area flood control efforts."" The new levee board paradigm literally put Louisiana on the frontier of good governance, but it was crafted and passed at breakneck speed. So here we are today with original, never before seen legislation, meaning there was likely to be issues and problems. And there were. A problem that surfaced immediately with the shiny new legislation was the difficulty of finding qualified applicants to meet the complex matrix of requirements. According to committee member Robert Travis Scott, this continues to be a problem today. Another issue which surfaced in 2011 was that the rules required burdensome traveling time for commissioners traveling from out of state. This prompted Louisiana State Senator J.P. Morrell to put the Governor on alert that he would vote against re-appointing two commissioners to the New Orleans Flood Authority citing the high cost of the flood experts' monthly commutes. Governor Jindal thinks he can control who is appointed to the Flood Authority East. But, what if the nominating committee stands up to the Governor?  It is still possible for the committee to choose nominees this Monday and retain control of the process.   And while political insulation may not have been a founding goal of the new levee board paradigm, it may have been an accidental result. But one thing is certain. We shall see in the weeks and months ahead just how independent the commissioners of the Flood Authority East really are.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
"Eastern Black Rhino, Endangered Species, Born At Zoo Atlanta (PHOTO)","By Noreen O'Donnell Aug 18 (Reuters) - An eastern black rhinoceros has been born  at Atlanta's zoo for the first time in the facility's history,  spurring hopes of renewed interest in the fate of the critically  endangered animal. The calf, which was born on Saturday night, appears to be  healthy and bonding with its mother, Zoo Atlanta officials said  on Sunday. It has not been named and its gender has not been  determined. ""Not only is this a first for Zoo Atlanta, going all the way  back to our founding in 1889, but this is a critically  endangered species that absolutely deserves the spotlight right  now,"" Raymond King, the zoo's president, said in a statement.  ""We hope that as we watch the calf grow up, we can spark new  connections with wildlife that desperately need our support."" The calf, which does not yet sport its species' signature  horn, was born to Andazi, a 7-year-old female, and her  9-year-old mate, Utenzi. It was the first offspring for both after the pair were  recommended for breeding by the Association of Zoos and  Aquariums' Rhino Species Survival Plan, which seeks to maintain  a genetically diverse, self-sustaining rhino population in North  American zoos. Andazi's pregnancy was confirmed in December and viewed  through an ultrasound earlier this year. Rhinos have gestation periods ranging from 14 to 18 months.  Calves are usually weaned within two years of being born, though  they might remain with their mothers for up to four years. The eastern black rhino was hunted almost to extinction, and  in recent decades it has suffered near-catastrophic population  declines, largely due to poaching. Its horns, skin and other  body parts are believed by some to have medicinal value. Conservation programs and patrolling of the rhino's habitats  have helped populations to increase to about 4,800 in the wild.  The western black rhino was declared extinct in 2011. Black rhinos were once the most numerous of the species,  according to the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, where a calf was born  a year ago. Black rhinos numbered 65,000 in 1970, but the global  population had dropped to 15,000 by 1980.

Steve Wozniak Just Blasted Uber For Poor Treatment Of Workers,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak just threw some shade at Uber.  On Monday, at the Future Transport Summit in Sydney, Australia, Wozniak denounced the ride-hailing company's disputed labor practices and critiqued what he sees as its monopolistic ambitions, according to Mashable.  ""Like a lot of people, I have some distrust of Uber and how their drivers don't really realize at first that they aren't making much money, maybe losing money on the wear and tear of their cars,"" Wozniak told reporters at the summit.  ""That's how I think of Uber: Not very nice thoughts,” Wozniak added.  David Rohrsheim, general manager of Uber in Australia, responded to Wozniak’s remarks by noting that Uber drivers have a job with rare flexibility.  ""It has to be a good deal for partners or otherwise they won't use the platform,"" Rorhsheim told Mashable Australia.  Wozniak isn't alone in criticizing the app. Class-action lawsuits filed by Uber drivers in California and Michigan argue that the company wrongly classifies its workers as independent contractors, allowing it to drive down their wages and withhold benefits. As contractors, drivers are exempt from minimum wage requirements and don't receive certain state and federal benefits. Both lawsuits contend that Uber drivers are, in fact, employees, a designation that comes with greater labor protections Wozniak added that he'd prefer to use Lyft from now on.  Lyft, which is Uber's main competitor in the U.S., agreed in January to expand benefits for drivers. Lyft drivers can no longer be fired at will and have the right to settle termination and pay disputes through arbitration. Despite those gains, Lyft drivers, like Uber drivers, are still considered independent contractors. Wozniak told reporters he’d also like to see more competition in the ride-sharing market. ""I would rather there be a lot of competitive forces,” Wozniak said. “I'd like there to be four or five choice that are like Uber anywhere you go."" The Woz might get his wish. Several new ride-sharing services are scheduled to hit roads soon. Chariot for Women, which launches Tuesday, is an alternative ride-sharing service with all-women drivers, exclusively for women. Another service, Juno, hopes to become Uber’s mirror opposite. It’s drivers will not only have employee status, but will also get equity in the company, in addition to several other perks.  Despite his concerns about Uber, overall, Wozniak isn’t too worried about the sorts of economic changes Uber represents.  ""You might come up with a new technology and some old jobs disappear and there are robots building cars,"" he said.

Volkswagen Pleads Guilty In U.S. Court In Diesel Emissions Scandal,"Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) pleaded guilty on Friday to three felony counts as part of a $4.3 billion plea agreement reached with the Justice Department in January over the automaker’s massive diesel emissions scandal. VW general counsel Manfred Doess made the plea on the company’s behalf after he said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Detroit that he was authorized by the board of directors of VW to enter a guilty plea. “Your honor, VW AG is pleading guilty to all three counts because it is guilty on all three counts,” Doess told the court. U.S. District Judge Sean Cox accepted the guilty plea to conspiracy to commit fraud, obstruction of justice and entry of goods by false statement charges. Doess said the criminal acts occurred in Germany and United States. Under the deal, VW agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years after admitting to installing secret software in 580,000 U.S. vehicles to enable it to beat emissions tests over a six-year period and emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. An assistant U.S. attorney, John Neal, told the court that the emissions scheme “was a well thought-out, planned offense that went to the top of the organization.” He said VW could have faced $17 billion to $34 billion in fines under sentencing guidelines. Volkswagen agreed to change the way it operates in the United States and other countries under the settlement. VW, the world’s largest automaker by sales, in January agreed to pay $4.3 billion in U.S. civil and criminal fines. In total, VW has agreed to spend up to $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offer to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The German automaker halted sales of diesel vehicles in late 2015 and has said it has no plans to resume sales of new U.S. diesels. The Justice Department also charged seven current and former VW executives with crimes related to the scandal. One executive is in custody and awaiting trial and another pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. Five of the seven are believed to be in Germany and have not been arraigned. German prosecutors are also investigating. VW chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said Monday the company expects to broaden disciplinary action beyond the two dozen employees it has already suspended. As part of its U.S. emission settlements, VW agreed to spend nearly $3 billion to offset excess emissions and make $2 billion in investments in zero emission vehicle infrastructure and awareness programs over a decade.

The Fakebook Inside Facebook,"This post first appeared at BillMoyers.com. Beginning in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and his companions made a historic contribution to the annals of alchemy: They converted the lust for human contact into gold. Facebook’s current net worth is more than $500 billion, with Zuckerberg’s own share tallied at $74.2 billion, which makes him something like the fifth-wealthiest person in the world. What can be said about Facebook can also more or less be said of Google, Twitter, YouTube and other internet platforms, but here I’ll confine myself mainly to Facebook. What a business model! Whenever their 2-billion-and-counting users click, the company (a) sells their attention to advertisers, and (b) rakes in data, which it transmutes into information that it uses to optimize the deal it offers its advertisers. Facebook is the grandest, most seductive, farthest-flung, most profitable attention-getting machine ever. Meanwhile, according to a post-election BuzzFeed analysis by Craig Silverman, who popularized the term “fake news”: What has to be faced by those aghast at the prevalence of online disinformation is that it follows directly from the social-media business model. Ease of disinformation — so far, at least — is a feature, not a bug. Zuckerberg presents himself (and has often been lionized as) a Promethean bringer of benefits to all humanity. He is always on the side of the information angels. He does not present himself as an immoralist, like latter-day Nazi-turned-American-missile-scientist Wernher von Braun, as channeled by Tom Lehrer in this memorable lyric: To the contrary, Zuckerberg is a moralist. He does not affect to be apolitical. He wants his platform to be a “force for good in democracy.” He wants to promote voting. He wants to “give all people a voice.” These are political values. Which is a fine thing. Whenever you hear powerful people purport to be apolitical, check your wallet. There’s no evidence that in 2004, when Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard computer-savvy buddies devised their amazing apparatus and wrote the code for it, that they intended to expose Egyptian police torture and thereby mobilize Egyptians to overthrow Hosni Mubarak, or to help white supremacists distribute their bile, or to throw open the gates through which Russians could cheaply circulate disinformation about American politics. They were ingenious technicians who wholeheartedly shared the modern prejudice that more communication means more good for the world — more connection, more community, more knowledge, more, more, more. They were not the only techno-entrepreneurs who figured out how to keep their customers coming back for more, but they were among the most astute. These engineer-entrepreneurs devised intricate means toward a time-honored end, pursuing the standard modern media strategy: package the attention of viewers and readers into commodities that somebody pays for. Their product was our attention. Sounds like a nifty win-win. The user gets (and relays) information, and the proprietor, for supplying the service, gets rich. Information is good, so the more of it, the better. In Zuckerberg’s words, the goal was, and remains, “a community for all people.” What could go wrong? So it’s startling to see the cover of this week’s Economist, a publication not hitherto noted for hostility to global interconnection under the auspices of international capital. The magazine’s cover graphic shows the Facebook “f” being wielded as a smoking gun. The cover story asks, “Do social media threaten democracy,” and proceeds to cite numbers that have become fairly familiar now that American politicians are sounding alarms: Facebook’s chief response to increasingly vigorous criticism is an engineer’s rationalization: that it is a technological thing — a platform, not a medium. You may call that fatuously naïve. You may recognize it as a commonplace instance of the Silicon Valley belief that if you figure out a way to please people, you are entitled to make tons of money without much attention to potentially or actually destructive social consequences. It’s reminiscent of what Thomas Edison would have said if asked if he intended to bring about the electric chair, Las Vegas shining in the desert, or, for that matter, the internet; or what Johannes Gutenberg have said if asked if he realized he was going to make possible the Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf. Probably something like: We’re in the tech business. And: None of your business. Or even: We may spread poison, sure, but also candy. This candy not only tastes good, Zuckerberg believes, but it’s nutritious. Thus on Facebook — his preferred platform, no surprise — Mark Zuckerberg calls his brainchild “a platform for all ideas” and defends Facebook’s part in the 2016 election with this ringing declaration: “More people had a voice in this election than ever before.” It’s a bit like saying that Mao Zedong succeeded in assembling the biggest crowds ever seen in China, but never mind. Zuckerberg now “regrets” saying after the election that it was “crazy” to think that “misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election.” But he still boasts about “our broader impact … giving people a voice to enabling candidates to communicate directly to helping millions of people vote.” Senators as well as journalists are gnashing their teeth. Hearings are held. As always when irresponsible power outruns reasonable regulation, the first recourse of reformers is disclosure. This is, after all, the age of freedom of information (see my colleague Michael Schudson’s book, The Rise of the Right to Know: Politics and the Culture of Transparency, 1945–1975). On the top-10 list of cultural virtues, transparency has moved right up next to godliness. Accordingly, Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain have introduced an Honest Ads Act, requiring disclosure of the sources of funds for online political ads and (in the words of the senators’ news release) “requiring online platforms to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence the American electorate. (A parallel bill has been introduced in the House.) And indeed, disclosure is a good thing, a place to start. But it’s a start, not a finish. Consider how disclosure was supposed to remedy deficiencies in the laissez-faire system of political donations. Thanks to the post-Watergate reforms, any curiosity-seeker can today readily find out who donated to whom in which election. Data piles higher than mountains. But you may have noticed that disclosure has not drained any swamps. As the law and political science professor Richard L. Hasen wrote in 2010, just after the Supreme Court decided in Citizens United that corporations (and unions) could donate as much as they like to any political committee, the disclosure rules are not only largely toothless but “porous.” That’s one word for the plutocratic chew-up of American political finance. What to do? That’s the question of the hour. The midterm elections of 2018 are less than a year away. Europeans have their own ideas, which make Facebook unhappy, though it ought not be surprising that a global medium runs into global impediments — and laws. In September the European Union told Facebook, Twitter and other social media to take down hate speech or face legal consequences. In May 2016, the companies had “promised to review a majority of hate speech flagged by users within 24 hours and to remove any illegal content.” But 17 months later, the EU’s top regulator said the promise wasn’t good enough, for “in more than 28 percent of cases, it takes more than one week for online platforms to take down illegal content.” Meanwhile, Europe has no First Amendment to impede online (or other) speech controls. Holocaust denial, to take a conspicuous example, is a crime in 16 countries. And so, consider a German law that went into effect on Oct. 1 to force Facebook and other social-media companies to conform to federal law governing the freedom of speech. According to The Atlantic: As for the United Kingdom, Facebook has not responded to charges that foreign intervention through social media also tilted the Brexit vote. As Carole Cadwalladr writes in The Guardian: Then what? In First Amendment America, of course, censorship laws would never fly. Then can reform be left up to Facebook management? Unsurprisingly, that’s what the company wants. At congressional hearings last week, their representatives said that by the end of 2018 they would double the number of employees who would inspect online content. But as New York Times reporters Mike Isaac and Daisuke Wakabayashi wrote, “in a conference call with investors, Facebook said many of the new workers are not likely to be full-time employees; the company will largely rely on third-party contractors.” Suppose that company is serious about scrubbing their contacts of lies and defamations. It’s unlikely that temps and third-party contractors, however sage, however algorithm-equipped, can do the job. So back to the question: Beyond disclosure, which is a no-brainer, what’s to be done, and by whom? For one thing, as the fierce Facebook critic Zeynep Tufekci notes, many on-the-ground employees are troubled by less-than-forceful actions by company owners. Why don’t wise heads in the tech world reorganize Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (which existed through 2013)? Through recent decades, we have seen excellent organizations of this sort arise from many professional quarters: scientists — nuclear scientists in particular, lawyers, doctors, social workers and so on. Ever since 1921, when in a short book called The Engineers and the Price System the great economic historian Thorstein Veblen looked to engineers to overcome the venality of the corporations that employed them, such dreams have led a sort of subterranean, but sometimes aboveground, life. The Economist is not interested in such radical ideas. Having sounded an alarm about the toxicity of social media, The Economist predictably — and reasonably — goes on to warn against government intrusion. Also reasonably, it allots responsibility to thoughtless consumers, though while blaming the complicit victims it might well reflect on the utter breakdown of democratic norms under the spell of Republican fraudulence and insanity: Not content to stop there, though, The Economist offers other remedies: But in the U.S., it’s time to consider more dramatic measures. Speaking of disclosure, many social scientists outside the company would like Facebook to open up more of its data — for one reason among others, to understand how their algorithms work. There are those in the company who say they would respond reasonably if reformers and researchers got specific about what data they want to see. What specifically should they ask? Should there be, along British lines, a centrally appointed regulatory board? Since 2003, the UK has had an Office of Communications with regulatory powers. Its board is appointed by a Cabinet minister. Britain also has a press regulation apparatus for newspapers. How effective these are I cannot say. In the U.S., should a sort of council of elders be established in Washington, serving staggered terms, to minimize political rigging? But if so, what happens when Steve Bannon gets appointed? Columbia law professor Tim Wu, author of The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads, advocates converting Facebook into a public benefit or nonprofit company. The logic is clear, though for now it’s a nonstarter. But we badly need the debate. The Economist’s conclusion is unimpeachable: The notion of automatic enlightenment through clicks was, of course, a pipe dream. What’s more plausible today is a nightmare. It is no longer a decent option for a democracy — even a would-be democracy — to stand by mumbling incantations to laissez faire while the institutions of reason are shaking.",TECH,TECH
Court Denies Final Attempt By Russian Athletes To Compete In Winter Olympics,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Friday it has dismissed 47 appeals from Russian athletes and coaches to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, which open later in the day. The Russians had appealed their exclusion from the games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the doping scandal from the 2014 Sochi Games but the decision now puts an end to any hopes of a quick Olympic return. “In its decisions, the CAS arbitrators have considered that the process created by the IOC to establish an invitation list of Russian athletes to compete as Olympic athletes from Russia (OAR) could not be described as a sanction but rather as an eligibility decision,” it said in a statement. The IOC in December banned Russia from the games over doping in the country that included massive manipulation of doping samples at the Sochi Olympics and more than 1,000 athletes across several sports. It also banned dozens of athletes from the games for life and stripped their Sochi Games medals following several investigations into the doping affair. “We welcome this decision which supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes,” an IOC spokesperson said on Friday. Days earlier CAS had upheld the appeal of 28 athletes due to insufficient evidence but the IOC still refused to invite them saying the evidence was there. Instead it invited 169 carefully screened Russian athletes to compete as neutrals under the Olympic flag. It has also suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). “Although the ROC was suspended, the IOC nevertheless chose to offer individual athletes the opportunity to participate in the Winter Games under prescribed conditions - a process that was designed to balance the IOC’s interest in the global fight against doping and the interests of individual athletes from Russia.” Among those appealing on Friday were athletes who were not sanctioned for doping in their careers and were not named specifically in the investigations but were still excluded from the games, with the IOC saying the evidence was there as was suspicion of wrong-doing. Konstantin Vybornov, spokesman for the Olympic athletes from Russia in Pyeongchang, told Reuters he could not immediately comment on the CAS ruling. The games begin later on Friday and run to Feb. 25. (Additional reporting by Gabriellle Tetrault-Farber, Editing by Peter Rutherford/Greg Stutchbury)",SPORTS,SPORTS

Google To Start Selling 2 New Watches,"Google will make a fresh foray into the smartwatch market by releasing two new devices in early 2017, a company product manager said in a report published Thursday.  Google, which has lagged behind smartwatch rivals Apple and Samsung, will begin selling Android Wear 2.0 watches in next year’s first quarter, Jeff Chiang told The Verge.  “We are working with a partner OEM on flagship watches for Android Wear 2.0,”  a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The devices will be known by the partner’s name, rather than Google’s.  New features in the Wear 2.0 platform include apps that wearers can run without a phone, and support for Android Pay and the voice-operated Google Assistant, The Verge reported. Many customers with existing Android Wear watches will get an update to the 2.0 platform. Tech blogs such as Android Police have been covering leaks about the watches for months. The devices had been nicknamed Angelfish and Swordfish in those early reports, and they may wind up looking like this, according to Android Police. The Android Wear watches face competition from several established companies and uncertain consumer demand. Reports this fall were divided over whether smartwatch shipments plummeted or surged in the past year.  Despite beating Apple into the smartwatch market in 2014, Android Wear hasn’t kept up with its rival, according to Wearable. Samsung Gear rolled out its latest wearable, the S3, in August, well ahead of the holiday shopping season. Fitness device maker Fitbit, meanwhile, acquired watchmaker Pebble this month.  Check out The Verge’s article for more hardcore specs about Google’s latest gadgets.

Tim Cook Not Backing Down From Protecting Dreamers,"Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterated his support for undocumented young people who were brought to the U.S. when they were children, tweeting on Sunday morning that he stood with his 250 colleagues who are so-called “Dreamers.” Reports surfaced over the weekend indicating that President Donald Trump was planning to announce his decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, an Obama-era program that protects Dreamers from deportation and grants them temporary work permits and driver’s licenses. Cook, who earlier in the week joined business leaders in sending a letter to Trump urging him to preserve DACA, re-emphasized his support on Twitter. 250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values. Later on Sunday, Politico and Reuters reported that Trump plans to end DACA with a six-month delay on enforcement. If that happens, Congress could pass legislation and provide a more permanent solution for the nearly 800,000 people DACA currently protects. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Tuesday.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Feds and BP Clash Over Barrels Spilled at Macondo Trial,"This article is published in ""The Louisiana Weekly"" in the Oct. 14, 2013 edition. At the Macondo spill trial, number crunching or quantification of the oil flow started Monday in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, with Judge Carl Barbier presiding. The United States is on one side with a figure of about 5 million barrels for the disaster that commenced in late April 2010, versus BP and Anadarko on the other with 3.26 million barrels. By Wednesday afternoon, the feds had rested their case on quantification, and BP began calling its witnesses Thursday. In Monday's opening statement, government attorney Steve O'Rourke said the United States would present four experts using different methodologies. In modeling by these witnesses, principle engineer Ronald Dykhuizen of Sandia National Laboratories considered the well's capping stack data; retired Sandia senior scientist and engineer Stewart Griffiths examined blowout preventer data; University of Tulsa engineering professor Mohan Kelkar used a material balance approach; and Mehran Pooladi-Darvish, senior director at IHS Inc., relied on reservoir simulation. The upshot of these studies was ""they all match up at around 5 million barrels of oil total,"" O'Rourke said. Those four experts used data provided by BP during the spill, and ""they each conclude that the rate at the beginning was about 62,000 barrels of oil per day,"" O'Rourke said. ""By the last day, July 15, 2010, it was about 53,000 barrels. Adding those days up, it was 5 million barrels."" About 812,000 barrels were collected during the spill by the Top Hat containment device, the capping stack and drilling vessel Helix Q4000, O'Rourke said. That left 4.2 million barrels released out of the five million barrels that exited the well, he said. The fed's science team for the spill included three national laboratories associated with the U.S. Dept. of Energy--Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos, together known as Tri-Labs. The team, led by Sandia director Tom Hunter, offered assistance in the spill response, O'Rourke said. ""The defendants might present a case to you that these Tri-Labs people were just political hacks, put there by the Administration to generate a high flow rate,"" O'Rourke said. ""But Dr. Hunter will come and testify to you that there was no conspiracy, no Administration agenda. They were there to try to get the right answers and to help."" When BP needed to shut in the Macondo well, it relied on National Labs' calculations, he said.  O'Rourke said the defendants won't present a final, daily flow rate during the quantification trial. ""They will nitpick at our experts for sure, but they will not tell you what the actual flow rate was,"" he said.  The feds are using the oil industry's definition of barrels in their legal battle against BP. ""In the Clean Water Act, the penalty only applies to barrels, defined as 42 gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit,"" O'Rourke said. ""It doesn't state what pressure. But in the industry, there is a term called stock-tank barrel. And this is 42 gallons at 60 degrees Fahrenheit at one atmosphere pressure or sea level pressure.""  Barrel measurement starts in the reservoir, O'Rourke said. ""What happens is as these barrels come up and the pressure abates, the gas comes out--comes out as a solution, with off gases,"" he said. ""So by the time it gets to the surface of the water, a barrel down in the reservoir might be only half a barrel of liquid left."" O'Rourke said in addition to its litigation experts, the government panel known as the Flow Rate Technical Group, assembled by Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen, reached a consensus on a 53,000- barrel flow on the final day of the spill. After that, the presidential Oil Spill Commission in October 2010 said a consensus had emerged between federal and independent scientists, using different methods, that roughly 5 million barrels were released.  In comparison to 5 million barrels, the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska totaled 262,000 barrels. ""So what we have here is a Valdez worth of oil spilling out every four and a half days,"" O'Rourke said. BP lied to Congress about the flow, O'Rourke said. ""They later told their shareholders in their Securities and Exchange Commission filings that the flow was 4 million barrels, that 3.2 was collected,"" he said. ""With those statements, they are going to come here and tell you that it wasn't 4 million, it was 3.26 million"" or lower. He said BP arrived at its current numbers by cherry-picking data and ignoring information from the spill response. ""At the close of the evidence, your Honor, we will ask you to find as a fact that the beginning of the flow period, about 62,000 barrels of oil per day were coming out; that by the end about 53,000 barrels  were coming out,"" O'Rourke said. ""If you add those days together, it was 5 million barrels."" In his opening, attorney Mike Brock for BP and Anadarko, said during the previous week's source-control trial in New Orleans, witnesses testified about daily changes in the Macondo well during the spill. ""The United States is going to present evidence that relates to a day-by-day calculation over 86 days, when we are in a position where the wellbore is changing daily,"" he said. During the 85 days, many ""geometry changes"" occurred because of the structure of and activities affecting the well, including its riser, metal erosion and junk shots, Brock said. Junk shots were injections of golf balls and other objects to obstruct the flow.  ""The government first came out with their flow rate estimate of around 5 million barrels on August 2, 2010 after a few hours of work,"" based on a model that assumed the well geometry had not changed in 85 days, Brock said. Brock said some areas of the oil reservoir weren't connected, and not all of the oil below could flow in the well. But he said the feds assumed one hundred percent flow into the well. ""So that's one big difference that we have with the government,"" he said. He said in late July 2010, the feds were under pressure to come up with a daily and total flow to announce to the public as wild rumors flew about unaccounted-for oil. ""This five million figure that they're using in this case now is one that was designed to be a quick and dirty number for negotiation purposes, but not good science,"" he said. BP has a much lower spill number than the feds. ""It's BP's position that using the industry standard material-balance equation, that the amount of oil that left the well was 3.26 million stock-tank barrels,"" Brock said.  The material balance method considers oil in place before the spill, and based on the principle of conservation of mass, calculates the amount that's left in the well afterwards, he said. That's a typical way for industry to figure out what occurred, he said. In testimony Tuesday, Stewart Griffiths, a retired Sandia fluid dynamics and applied math expert, admitted he had no oil industry experience but defended his Macondo model--which is based on periodically measured pressures and flow rates of collected oil, along with fluid dynamics principles--to calculate what spewed over 86 days. Under questioning from government attorney Tom Benson, Griffiths said that before May 8, 2010, erosion of metal parts after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in late April affected cumulative discharge. ""Erosion is a phenomenon that can occur very, very rapidly, and then slows once apertures get opened a little bit,"" he said. After May 8, 2010, the blowout preventer's erosion had little impact on the well's cumulative discharge, he said. Griffiths concluded that erosion in the reservoir and wellbore reduced total discharge only slightly. BP contends that erosion lowered discharge to a greater extent. ""At the end of the day, I have the highest confidence in 5.0,"" million barrels having escaped the well, Griffiths said. ""I've actually checked these calculations more carefully than I have ever checked any calculations in my career."" On Wednesday, government witness Aaron Zick, a thermodynamic modeling expert, testified about fluid phase behavior. He was followed by professor Mohan Kelkar, who was questioned about his material balance modeling, uncertainty over oil in the reservoir before the spill, and his flow calculation of 54,000 barrels on the last day of  the spill.

In testimony Wednesday, Mehran Pooladi-Darvish, a reservoir engineering expert, said his wellbore and reservoir model put total oil released at 5 million to 5.3 million stock-tank barrels. BP started calling its witnesses Thursday. Martin Blunt, Imperial College London petroleum engineering professor, was asked about Macondo reservoir characteristics. He said the share of oil that could flow into the well from the reservoir was between 87 and 90 percent, which is a very good connectivity rate. Nonetheless, in his analysis 3.26 million stock-tank barrels exited the Macondo well in the spill. After a day off Friday and Columbus Day Monday, the trial will resume on Oct. 15. Penalties against BP for barrels spilled will be the subject of a later trial and could be assessed in early 2014. end",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
These Companies Are Sticking By The NRA (UPDATED),"In what may be a pivotal moment for American gun law reform, the National Rifle Association has become the object of intense pushback from anti-gun activists and survivors of the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 dead.  All the attention prompted the gun-rights group to break from its usual strategy of keeping quiet after mass gun deaths. NRA officials have gone on the attack to rail against the “politicization” of a tragedy, and going so far as to suggest that members of the media “love mass shootings” because of the ratings they supposedly bring. The uproar has once again presented companies affiliated with the NRA, and its powerful pro-gun lobby, with a question: to cut ties, or to continue a relationship with a large but controversial group?  The NRA partners with dozens of businesses to spread its pro-gun message and provide discounts to its members, who number 5 million, according to the group. But since the shooting, some companies have begun to jump ship.  Facing pressure from consumers, the First National Bank of Omaha said last week it would stop issuing NRA-branded Visa credit cards after its contract with the group expires. Enterprise Holdings, which operates the rental car brands Enterprise, National and Alamo, says it will end its discount program for NRA members next month, along with Avis and Budget. Hertz is out, too. Other companies ditching the NRA include Chubb, which underwrites the NRA’s Carry Guard firearms insurance meant to protect firearms owners involved in self-defense shootings; Symantec’s LifeLock, an identity-theft prevention service, and Norton, which offers computer security software; home security system provider SimpliSafe; Allied and North American Van Lines, two moving services; TrueCar, which powered a new and used car site; and MetLife, which had offered savings on home and auto insurance to NRA members. “We value all our customers but have decided to end our discount program with the NRA,” a MetLife spokesman said in a statement. On Friday, software company Wild Apricot said it had asked the NRA to remove its logo from the organization’s website. “We have contacted the NRA directly and asked them to remove our logo and the affiliated text, as they were actually using that without permission from us,” a spokesperson told ThinkProgress.   After initially defending discounts for NRA members traveling to Dallas in May for the group’s annual convention, both Delta and United announced plans to end their respective relationships with the NRA Saturday. Starkey Hearing Technologies, which offered savings on hearing aids for members, also stated it would not renew its contract with the NRA. A representative for Harland Clarke, which prints NRA-branded checks, said Sunday the company “intends to terminate” its contract with the group. Late Monday, insurance provider Lockton Affinity announced that it will no longer partner with the NRA on its Carry Guard insurance. The following companies, however, have not indicated that they plan to sever ties with the gun-rights group:  Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s Along with Cabela’s, which it acquired in 2017, Bass Pro Shops offers a wide variety of outdoor gear, and both stores are set to appear at the NRA’s national convention in May. A company spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Clearent Clearent, a credit card processing company, offers “firearms friendly” services geared toward NRA members. A representative did not respond to a request for comment. FedEx FedEx offers NRA members discounts from 18 percent to 26 percent on domestic and international shipping. The company said Monday in a statement that it doesn’t agree with the organization’s views on assault rifles and large-capacity magazines, but that it won’t eliminate its discount for NRA members.  “The NRA is one of hundreds of organizations in our alliances/association Marketing program whose members receive discounted rates for FedEx shipping,” it said. “FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs, or positions on issues.”  In a follow-up statement issued Tuesday, the shipping company clarified that it “has never provided any donation or sponsorship to the NRA which is one of hundreds of alliance and association participants that serve more than one million customers.” GunsDown, an anti-gun group, has been petitioning FedEx to end its affiliation with the NRA for over a year.  HotelPlanner The company powers the NRA’s travel discount site, offering savings on airfare and hotel reservations with major chains including Best Western, Mariott, Hampton Inn and others. HotelPlanner intends to honor its contract with the NRA. “Our company provides discounted rooms to several large associations, including the NRA. These associations greatly benefit our customers by buying discounted rooms from groups that might otherwise be charged a penalty by hotels for not using all of the rooms in their block,” HotelPlanner CEO Tim Hentschel said in a statement. “Many of our groups are charity events, weddings, family reunions, and youth sports teams, so saving these groups that are on a budget from any unforeseen expense is our number one priority at HotelPlanner.com.” Hyatt Regency (Dallas) The Hyatt Regency hotel in Dallas will host NRA events during the group’s annual convention in May.

Federal Prosecutors Still Trying To Turn Trump Inauguration Protesters Into Felons,"WASHINGTON ― Sixteen months after police swept up hundreds of people in mass arrests on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, federal prosecutors in the nation’s capital are trying to secure their first guilty verdicts against four defendants who participated in an anti-capitalism march that resulted in property damage in downtown D.C. Three of the four people they’re trying to convict actually damaged property, prosecutors contend. Each is facing five felony destruction-of-property charges, as well as one felony rioting charge, because the government argues they were part of a broader rioting conspiracy and can be held responsible for the broader damage. The second J20 trial ― a reference to Jan. 20, 2017 ― comes five months after a D.C. jury acquitted six other Inauguration Day defendants on all charges following a lengthy trial. Prosecutors admitted from the beginning of the first trial that there was no evidence any of those defendants personally damaged any property, but told jurors they should be found guilty because they were part of a rioting conspiracy. Jurors disagreed. A few weeks later, in January of this year, the Justice Department dropped felony charges against 129 defendants but said it would press forward with 59 other cases. Another 20 individuals have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor charges. The new trial unfolding in D.C. Superior Court this week involves defendants Michael Basillas, Seth Cadman, Anthony Felice and Casey Webber. All but Webber, the government alleges, actually took part in the destruction. Using the same language about a “sea of black masks” that she used in the first trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff’s opening statement walked jurors through the property damage that occurred during the protest march and how it affected ordinary people. She talked about the Starbucks worker who watched other workers dive for cover as glass windows “rained down upon them.” She spoke of the BP gas station employee who stacked cases of water against the door because the employee thought rioters would try to break inside. She talked about the limo driver who watched as his windows were smashed, the sandwich shop owner whose store was damaged, the hotel worker who hurried guests inside to prevent any injuries. She mimed the way protesters tossed newspaper vending boxes into the street and smashed windows. She said the defendants made the choice to participate in the destruction that day. “This trial is not about protest or disagreement or dissent,” Kerkhoff said, noting that protests can be powerful and beautiful and bring about change. But this wasn’t a protest, she said. “You can’t hide ― like a mask ― behind a protest.” Present in the courtroom for Wednesday’s opening arguments were Jessie Liu, the Trump-named U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, and Chelsea Manning, the WikiLeaks source whose lengthy prison sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama and who is now running for U.S. Senate in Maryland. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington is unique in that it’s an office headed by a presidential nominee that prosecutes crimes that would elsewhere be handled by local prosecutors. In the first trial, defense attorneys said the government’s actions against those who disrupted Inauguration Day were politically motivated. Defense attorneys may try similar tactics this time around and may also try to align their clients’ actions with the broader opposition to Trump. Rich Gallena, who represents Basillas, said his client took to the streets of Washington to exercise his First Amendment rights and stand up for minorities, immigrants and American workers. Only a small percentage of the group smashed windows, the lawyer said, and the photos that the government says show his client throwing a brick and attacking windows at a Starbucks outlet and a hotel are “grainy” and “blurred.” He pointed out how much time and effort the government had spent on the case. “They are desperate to pin that damage on someone, anyone,” Gallena said. But the evidence isn’t there, he added. Cadman’s attorney, Seth Schrager, spoke of his own participation in protests against the Vietnam War and said the extensive amount of video that prosecutors would use in the case wouldn’t prove anything against his client. Kerkhoff said video shows Cadman chucking an object at a Bank of America location. Matthew Rist, representing Felice, called the trial a case of “guilt by association” and described what he said was excessive force against his client, who is also charged with resisting arrest. Kerkhoff said that Felice lit flares and tried to break a window and that he’d also nearly escaped the police “kettle” maneuver that ensnared the group. Rist said police gave Felice “a good baptism” of pepper spray after he was thrown to the ground and posed no threat to them. Webber’s attorney, April Downs, started by listing all the things that her client didn’t do. He didn’t hit a window or toss a trash can. He didn’t have any hammers or rocks. The only reason he was on trial, she said, was that he received messages about the planning of the event ahead of time that contained information the government didn’t like.

"Protecting Rivers, Reducing Climate Vulnerability"," The mountain valleys of the North Indian state of Uttarakhand have been heavily developed with hydropower projects, tourism resorts and other infrastructure. When a cloudburst hit the state in June 2013, the choked rivers were unable to cope with the ravaging floods. Flashfloods washed away hundreds of buildings, bridges and dams, claimed more than 5,000 lives and caused an estimated damage of $50 billion.  Climate change will bring more extreme weather events such as droughts and the cloudburst experienced in Uttarakhand. Healthy rivers and their floodplains act as natural buffers that protect us from the worst vagaries of a changing climate. Free-flowing rivers build the deltas and mangrove belts that protect our coastlines, preserve fisheries and forests, and recharge the groundwater reserves that sustain our water supply and agriculture. Floodplains, marshes, dunes, reefs and mangrove forests -- often referred to as green infrastructure or bioshields -- are vital to making our societies more climate resilient. Climate change is water change. Learning from earlier flood disasters and preparing for climate change, governments, scientists and environmental organizations have started to remove levees and recreate floodplains on rivers such as the Rhine, the lower Yangtze and the lower Danube. Ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change is being promoted by forward-looking tools such as the EU Water Framework Directive and the UNECE Water Convention.  In spite of positive approaches rivers, the arteries of our planet, are under mounting pressure around the world. More than 60 percent of the world's major rivers have been fragmented. Freshwater ecosystems face higher risks of species extinction than any other major ecosystem. Even so, China, South and Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America are currently experiencing unprecedented dam-building booms. Ironically, the infrastructure built today not only weakens the climate resilience of riverine ecosystems, but is in itself highly vulnerable to a changing climate.  Parineeta Dandekar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People warns: ""Dammed rivers are damaged rivers; they are less able to protect us from climate change and more likely to worsen problems when big floods and droughts hit. We need honest and holistic cost-benefit analysis of dams to account for these climate change risks."" A new report published by International Rivers offers guidance on how to strengthen climate resilience in the water and energy sectors. The guide explains how rivers act as natural climate buffers, how large dams increase the vulnerability to climate change, and how climate resilience can be integrated into water resource management and infrastructure planning. It was prepared with input from experts and partner organizations, and is addressed at civil society organizations. The new publication, which was written by Katy Yan and Lori Pottinger, includes a lot of concrete cases studies and practical advice for groups working in the water and energy sectors and confronted by dam projects.  John Matthews of Conservation International, one of the advisors to the new guide, comments: ""Ecologically poorly designed water infrastructure is likely to reduce the inherent resilience and adaptive capacity of [developing] nations' ecosystems, permanently altering lakes, rivers, soils, and fisheries. Climate-infrastructure mismatches may actually make poor nations even poorer.""  The new report equips civil society groups to advocate for infrastructure investments that strengthen rather than weaken the climate resilience of ecosystems and human societies. It will be complemented by a video, and used for civil society training workshops on climate resilience in different parts of the world.

How Views On Guns Have Changed Since The Parkland Shooting,"The school shooting that took place in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year launched a new generation of gun control activists, inspired walkouts and marches, and sparked the most substantial ― and long-lasting ― shift in public opinion on guns in recent years. The appetite for gun control appears to have tapered off in the following weeks, but some surveys indicate that some changes in public opinion could endure.  In the more than two months since that shooting, HuffPost and YouGov have conducted five surveys tracking Americans’ views on guns. The results show a burst of support for gun reform in the two weeks after the shooting, followed by a gradual reversion to the mean. Once-heightened concerns about gun violence have tapered back to previous levels, as has a desire for stricter gun laws and a belief that gun restrictions can be passed without violating Second Amendment rights. A few changes in thought, however, seem to have stuck.  The percentage of Americans who believe it’s politically possible to pass gun laws has dropped several points since its high in late February, but it’s still higher than it was in the aftermath of last year’s massacres in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas. In the most recent survey, one-fifth of Americans also chose gun policies as one of the two issues they found most important. That remains a noticeable, if modest, uptick from the 13 percent who chose it as a priority following the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Other polling since the Parkland shooting also suggested gun control was carrying greater-than-usual prominence on the campaign trail, although it’s unclear how much of that energy will remain until November. That public opinion shifted at all in the wake of the shooting was striking. It’s even more striking that it lasted as long as it did. Last year’s shootings, by contrast, appeared to have little effect on Americans’ views about guns. One illustration of the uncommon nature of this year’s debate comes from Google Trends, which tracks the level interest in various search terms. According to that data, searches for “mass shooting” usually dwarf searches for “gun control” in the aftermath of an incident, and both disappear soon after. After the Parkland shooting, though, interest in gun control significantly outpaced attention to the shooting itself. Even now, specific gun reform proposals remain broadly popular.  In the most recent survey, conducted in mid-April, three-quarters of Americans favored strengthening background checks, while just 13 percent opposed the proposal. A 63 percent majority favored raising the age for gun purchases to 21, with only about one-quarter in opposition. And a 42 percent plurality of those polled said President Donald Trump was not doing enough to pass new gun laws, while about one-quarter said he’s doing the right amount. Just 9 percent that he’s doing too much. (At the end of February, 37 percent said Trump wasn’t doing enough.) Data from other pollsters, meanwhile, suggests that the national focus on guns is waning. But some find that the decline has stopped short of entirely erasing the changes post-Parkland. Some of the most granular information comes from the progressive pollster Civiqs, which has been tracking data on gun control for several years. According to its data, voters’ backing for such restrictions spiked from the low 50s prior to the Parkland shooting to a high of 60 percent ― a bigger reaction than in the wake of mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; San Bernardino, California; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs. Some of that change wore off in the weeks after, stabilizing around the 55 percent mark. Civiqs’ data only goes back through 2015. But support for enacting new gun laws in April was higher than it was after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in 2012, according to a Washington Post/ABC News survey, thanks largely to a movement among Democratic-leaning groups. A 53 percent majority of Americans told pollsters they believed student activism on guns were part of a lasting movement, while 43 percent said the rallies were “more of a one-time thing.” Another poll from Gallup found that the share of Americans mentioning guns or gun control as the nation’s most important problem dropped from 13 percent in March to 6 percent in April ― a downtick that nevertheless leaves it as one of the highest-ranked national issues. In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll, a slim 53 percent majority of Democratic voters said guns will be a major factor for them in November, down 21 points since February.  “This finding raises a cautionary flag for voters who want gun policy to be front and center this election cycle,” Marist polling director Lee Miringoff told NPR.

"Google Image, The Daily Stormer And Anti-Semitism","Last weekend, I was preparing to submit a book manuscript to a publisher. I had met an interested editor this summer. Let’s call her or him Mrs. X or Mr. Y. To make sure that I had the correct spelling of the person’s last name, I typed it into the google search field and clicked on Google image for results. To my great horror, as I scrolled down the image results, Mrs. X / Mr. Y was labeled with a yellow Star of David containing the word “Jude” (Jew) in Hebrew-like lettering. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, “In September 1941, the Nazi regime, at Goebbels’ urgent request, ordered Germany’s Jews over the age of six” to wear such a star. In 1942, the measure was introduced in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovakia and other countries occupied by Germany. The lettering was also used for the movie poster of one of the most notorious anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda films: The Eternal Jew (Der ewige Jude), directed by Fritz Hippler and released in 1940. The poster promoting The Eternal Jew, an exhibit devoted to the same topic and under the same title in Munich at the Deutsches Museum between November 1937 and January 1938, used the same lettering. Additionally, a book of 265 photographs was published in 1937 under this title. (Der ewige Jude, Munich: Franz Eher / Zentralverlag der NSDAP, 1937). The press that published the book of photographs also published the Nazi paper: Völkischer Beobachter (People’s Observer). The photos labeled with the Star of David and the word “Jew” in Google images all link to the same web-site: The Daily Stormer. As investigative journalists A.C. Thompson and Ken Schwencke stated in a recent article, “In An Ugly Election Result Hate Surges Online”: “In the past month, more than 564,000 unique visitors have spent time on the Daily Stormer.” Of the racist online publications “The Daily Stormer,” they continue, “seems to have seen the most dramatic spike in readership. In a recent post, the Daily Stormer claimed that since the election the site ‘has had an added 30% traffic.’ Over the past month, the site has had nearly 10 million page views.” The site is named after Der Stuermer (The Stormtrooper), the weekly virulently anti-Semitic and racist Nazi tabloid paper published by Julius Streicher starting in 1923. After serving in World War One, Streicher (1885-1946) trained to be and worked as an elementary school teacher. He was a member of the Nazi party starting in 1922. On the night of November 8-9, 1923, Streicher participated in a coup attempt carried out in Munich by Hitler and the Nazi Party, in an attempt to overthrow Germany’s government. It became known as the Beer Hall Putsch. As a result of these actions, Hitler was charged with high treason but given a light sentence, during which time he wrote Mein Kampf, and Streicher was no longer allowed to teach. Hitler’s coup attempt was inspired by Benito Mussolini’s “March on Rome” in October 1922, which brought fascists to power in Italy. As part of his coup, Hitler planned to carry out a similar March on Berlin. As Stephen Lee points out in European Dictatorships, by 1938, sixteen countries had succumbed to dictatorship and by 1940 only five democracies remained in Europe. The era, he argues, was marked by starkly polarized politics, between left and right; and by rampant racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Within the first months of the National Socialist regime, Streicher was appointed as chair of the Zentralkomitee zur Abwehr der Jüdischen Greuel- und Boykotthetze (Central Committee for the Defense against Jewish Atrocities and Boycott Agitation). In this capacity, he organized a nation-wide one-day boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1, 1933. He also continued the publication of Der Stuermer and published anti-Semitic children’s books, such as the Giftpilz (The Poisonous Mushroom). Streicher was captured in May 1945 by U.S. forces. At the International Military Tribunal (IMT) or the so-called Nuremberg Trials, he was one of 24 leading Nazi officials charged with and convicted of crimes against humanity, sentenced to death by hanging on October 16, 1946. It is untenable that search results on Google Images, as well as other engines, label people in this manner. Beyond being untenable, it would seem to constitute a hate crime. Germany has laws in place banning Nazi, Neo-Nazi and Anti-Semitic imagery. So Google has to work under different laws in Germany. Shouldn’t Google address the issue, that is, respond and take it down? If racist graffiti shows up on a school wall, it is considered hate speech. If it shows up on Google, shouldn’t Google intervene?",TECH,TECH
Why Isn't There A Birth Control Emoji?,"In June 2018, there will be 2,823 emoji in the Unicode Standard ― the global specification that ensures characters are interpreted the same across platforms. But nowhere in that list ― which has everything from zombies (both male and female!) to smiling poop ― is there an emoji to signify birth control. At least, not yet. This April, Nora Hamada and her friend Megan Giller, sent in an application to the Unicode Consortium for what they believe is the first-ever emoji to represent birth control (Disclaimer: Giller freelances for Engadget as a copy editor). Hamada came up with the idea earlier this year when she joined an emoji proposal workshop in New York City out of curiosity. The workshop was run by Emojination, a grassroots organization dedicated to making emoji more inclusive. Emojination was created because the Unicode Consortium, the organization that selects and approves of emojis, is mostly comprised of multinational tech companies. There are 12 full voting members, which include Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, German software company SAP and Shopify. The only non-tech entity in this list is the government of Oman. In order to be a full voting member, you have to pay $18,000 a year (There are lower membership tiers as well, but not all of them have voting privileges). Emojination co-founder Jennifer 8. Lee found it odd that just a handful of corporate and government entities decide the world’s emoji. Now, she helps people submit applications for emoji they think is missing from our cultural lexicon. Some of Emojination’s more successful projects include the dumpling (universal cross-cultural food), the hijab (muslim women representation) and the ballet flat (a woman’s shoe that’s not a high heel). Lee happened to be the one leading the Emojination workshop the day Hamada attended. Hamada was inspired by Lee’s story, and was fascinated that anybody ― even you and me ― can submit an emoji application. She thought about what new emoji she could introduce that would be a positive change to the world. “I immediately came up with the birth control emoji,” said Hamada. “When you search for emoji to represent women and safe sex, the things that come up most often are breastfeeding and babies.” But she feels that there should also be an emoji for women like herself, who have decided not to have children. Giller feels the same way, which prompted their collaboration. Hamada and Giller posit that the invention of the birth control pill in the 1960s also signifies a historical turning point, where women were finally able to take control over their own bodies and subsequently, their own lives. A Smithsonian magazine article in 2013 noted that “the successes of the feminist movement, and the mass entry of women into the workforce, the professions and academia, might not have been possible without the pill’s power of predictability.” As such, Hamada and Giller believe that the birth control pill is also a symbol for feminism and female empowerment. “It stands for equality and the right to choose,” said Giller. “Frankly, I can’t believe a birth control emoji had never been done before,” said Hamada.  Well, that’s almost true. Back in 2015, condom-maker Durex applied for a condom emoji to be added to the Unicode Standard. It even ran a publicity campaign on social media and elsewhere to promote the idea, complete with a #CondomEmoji hashtag. “An official safe sex emoji will enable young people to overcome embarrassment around the discussion of safe sex,” the company claimed, adding that it would also raise awareness of protection against STDs. Ultimately though, the condom emoji application was denied. Engadget was unable to get an answer as to why from Unicode or Durex, but through conversations with Hamada, Giller and Lee, there are a few possible reasons. One is that the condom emoji application was spearheaded by a company that would benefit financially from the popularization of said emoji, and that might not have been acceptable. Lee also said that the proposal itself likely was not a very good one (you can study it for yourself here). Another, more official answer, is that Unicode turned it down because industry partners like Facebook and Google didn’t support it, perhaps for not being family-friendly enough. When asked why she thinks there might not have been a birth control emoji before, Hamada says that it could be because Unicode is an international organization, and is therefore averse to anything deemed too political. “There are groups of people that look down on birth control,” she said. “It’s possible that’s part of it.” “Remember that the emoji are universally implemented on keyboards around the world,” said Lee. “So the emoji have to be things vendors [like Apple and Google] are comfortable putting in all markets and all cultures.” She pointed out, for example, that the same sex family emoji was frowned upon in Russia, and that alcohol emoji like wine and beer was an issue in Muslim countries. Unicode got around the latter issue by calling them “wine glass” and “beer mug” emoji respectively, which was deemed acceptable. Perhaps savvy to this nuance in language, Hamada and Giller titled their emoji “Pills in a circular case.” But it was still clearly defined as an emoji symbolizing birth control, complete with a lengthy description as to the historical importance of the pill and how relevant it is in today’s society. They also included various cases in which it would be suitable, and how it’s frequently requested in social media. The emoji is that of a circular case because of its iconic imagery, which Hamada and Giller say is generally recognized as synonymous with the pill. Using the standard pill emoji is insufficient, they argue, because that’s often used in reference to illegal drugs and parties. On the other hand, using other emoji like eggplant, hot dog and lipstick to talk about safe sex isn’t right either. There are examples of workarounds like a baby emoji followed by a giant X and then a pill, but that’s a little too complex. Hamada and Giller made their case in a lengthy nine-page application, which they compiled and submitted with the help of Lee and Emojination. Lee also matched them with a designer, who created a mock up of what the emoji might look like. After a few weeks, the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee ― which processes all the emoji applications ― came back asking for some revisions. They wanted a different version of the image ― the first one was tilted to the side, so it wasn’t as obvious as to what it was ― along with some statistics that would compare its use against an already existing emoji. They had the designer create a newer, cleaner emoji, and are now working on including those aforementioned stats. Of course, it’s still early days, and the application process is a fairly lengthy one. Unicode says on its site that it often takes up to two years for an emoji to go from application to approval. And even then, each of the vendors (eg. Apple, Google, Facebook) need time to create their own version for their platform. Hamada remains hopeful. After all, the subcommittee didn’t outright deny it, and seemed to express some interest. In the meantime, Hamada said they were recently interviewed as part of an upcoming yet-to-be-named documentary about emoji. “I find the whole process fascinating,” she said. Plus, she thinks the application is particularly timely during a climate where female reproductive rights might be in danger. “Our rights for birth control are being taken away. In a way, this is a small form of protest against that.” Related Articles: This post was originally published on Engadget.",TECH,TECH

NCAA’s New Sexual Violence Policy Underwhelming At Best,"The NCAA Board of Governors announced on Thursday they adopted a new sexual violence policy. The policy, adopted after a recommendation from the Commission to Combat Campus Sexual Violence, requires college athletes and administrators to annually complete sexual violence education. While the NCAA announced this policy to fanfare, it merely follows what is already required under the federal Jeanne Clery Act (which includes nearly $55,000 per violation fines for colleges that violate the requirement), and more is required for there to be true accountability for violent behavior in collegiate athletics. What it doesn’t contain is enforcement or accountability that approaches penalties reaching the level as the purchase of a hamburger for a student-athlete. The school president or chancellor, athletics director and Title IX coordinator will be required to annually attest that the education was conducted. This provides slightly more accountability than the Clery Act, amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which merely requires that all incoming students and employees receive sexual violence education, and that there be ongoing educational campaigns. It, however, is far short of the types of reforms that both of us, and other advocates, have been seeking for several decades. This policy was approved by the NCAA Board of Governors, representatives from conferences who are either presidents or chancellors. Concerning is whether these Board of Governors, overseeing major national universities, did not know that this policy simply mirrors existing federal policy or they did know and passed it off as groundbreaking because the general population do not know what the Clery Act is. The NCAA was lobbied in 2010 to address sexual assault and domestic violence by emulating the standards in Title IX and adding accountability. When female athletes have become victims of male athletes, then the NCAA should absolutely have a policy as the governing body of all student-athletes. In fact, collegiate athletic conferences have chosen to take steps much more effective than the NCAA, such as a transfer policy and denying entrance to athletes investigated for sexual assault or domestic violence. The NCAA doesn’t have a policy that would have addressed the allegations of violence against Ezekiel Elliott during his time at Ohio State, leaving it to the NFL to act now. But, the NFL is an employer. The NCAA has an unpaid labor force. The NCAA says it cannot be a state actor, a status the NCAA has fought for in NCAA v. Tarkanian all the way to the Supreme Court, but remains debatable given other state athletic association rulings and the NCAA’s own investigations into Penn State and Montana. In fact, the NCAA’s “lack of institutional control” infraction should be cited by the NCAA for a program, like Baylor, who has shown exactly that. They could have used it in the new “policy” as an enforcement measure. They didn’t. At the very least, when a collegiate athlete has been found responsible for or convicted of an act of violence they should lose their privilege to compete on behalf of their institution. Competing, and serving as an ambassador of the institution, is an honor and a privilege that is not deserved by those who commit senseless violence. Of course now if a student athlete leaves one school they can simply transfer to and play for another institution, unless they are one of the institutions or are in one of the conferences that banned transfers or incoming freshmen athletes with a violent history. That’s leadership. S.

"MSNBC Host Hugh Hewitt Suggests 'Trench Coat' Control, Not Gun Control","Conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt has a novel idea to curb school mass shootings: Ban trench coats. Hewitt, an MSNBC host, rejected limits on guns as a response to last week’s school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, where police say a student used his dad’s shotgun and revolver hidden beneath a trench coat to kill 10 people. “To the teachers and administrators out there, the trench coat is kind of a giveaway,” Hewitt said Monday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show” on Salem Radio Network. “You might just say no more trench coats. The creepy people, make a list, check it twice.” Hewitt said he suggested coat control because he can’t see stepping on gun rights. Even universal background checks for gun buyers and a ban on assault-style weapons probably wouldn’t have prevented the Texas shooting, he said. “It is a Second Amendment right, it’s not a Second Amendment suggestion,” Hewitt said. “It’s as fundamental to the republic as free speech and freedom of religion and due process, and the right to be safe and secure in your own home.” Two teen murderers killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999 while wearing trench coats. They were initially incorrectly described as members of a group known as the “Trench Coat Mafia.” The Texas lieutenant governor said the problem in the Santa Fe attack was that there were “too many entrances” to the school. National Rifle Association head Oliver North blamed too many teenagers on Ritalin and a culture of violence. Listen to what else Hewitt had to say in the clip above.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Would The NFL Owners Really Listen To Kaepernick?,"The NFL Commissioner’s office said it wanted former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to attend the second NFL owners meeting. The NFL Players Association said it wanted Kaepernick to attend the meeting. Now whether Kaepernick will attend the meeting or not is anybody’s guess. So far, Kap has done what he has done since the controversy about his anthem protest and his alleged blackballing from the League swirled, and that’s say absolutely nothing publicly about any of this. There are a lot of what ifs then over whether he’ll attend. And if he does, what he would say. However, the bigger ‘what if’ is would the NFL owners really listen and take heed of what he could say to them? NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, presumably speaking on behalf of many, if not most, of owners has talked a good game about the League getting more involved in “social change issues” that impact on poor, minority communities. Goodell has met with some of the more outspoken NFL players about their concerns about combatting police abuse, mass incarceration, and racial injustices. These are the very things that Kap sat, took the knee, tweeted about, spent his own money on, and ultimately got kicked out of the League for addressing. If Kap ever did get an audience with the owners he almost certainly would talk about these causes and press the owners to put their money, time, energy, and behemoth clout, behind support of. The betting odds are that some of the owners would up their efforts to do a few of these things. It wouldn’t take much for NFL teams to pump a few more dollars into education, job training programs, and mentoring programs for at risk youth, and issue a statement here and there about police abuse. These actions are the cheap and easy way for the NFL to show concern. There are two big problems with all this. Goodell strongly hinted at one when he noted more than once that only a handful of NFL players have said or done anything to back Kap. That means something as simple and defiant as raising a clinched fist, sitting on the bench, or taking a knee during the playing of the anthem. Goodell doubled down on his skepticism about the protests when he pointedly noted that the fans don’t like any of this. He has heard the boos that have rained down on the players when they have locked arms during the national anthem. This not just the pique of a few hot-headed fans. Polls and surveys show that most NFL fans demand that the players just play ball and leave the politics out of the game. They are the ones who shell out tens of millions in ticks, for NFL paraphernalia, the fantasy leagues, buy products from NFL corporate sponsors, and boost the TV ratings. Goodell and the owners walk a thin tight line between them and the more vociferous black players who demand that the NFL be a social change agent. The line gets even thinner when Goodell and the owners continually see tweets and hear saber rattling broadsides from Trump screaming for the League to crack down on the protests. The owners get indignant, and issue outraged statements, telling Trump to butt out. But these are the same owners who are rock solid GOP guys, have given millions to the party over the years, and that includes fattening Trump’s campaign coffers. When Trump pops off about the League, they know that he speaks for millions of NFL fans The other problem is owners like Dallas Cowboy’s Owner Jerry Jones, Houston Texans’ owner Robert McNair and Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder. They aren’t just ultra conservative, hard line, outspoken opponents of any compromise with the players. They are the NFL’s Platinum Star owners. They carry a lot of weight in League decision making circles. They’re not likely to budge from their frozen in time, hard-nosed stance on the protests, let along do anything beyond the usual PR, safe cause stuff the League routinely does to allegedly show it cares about issues beyond the playing field. There’s one more ace the owners and Goodell have to stall, and ultimately force the players to get back to business as usual. That’s the game itself. The players are players not activists. They make a lot of money, and they want desperately to get their teams into the playoffs. This is will be the prime focus of the players, coaches and management as the playoff race heats up. So, the owners can play for time, clamp a tight muzzle on Jones and McNair so they won’t say anything dumb that rile up the players. Kap then can say what he wants about police abuse and racial injustice. The owners, including Jones and McNair, will listen politely, tell the media how “productive” this was, and then quickly get back to doing what they want to do more than anything else. That’s just play ball. ―- Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. He is an associate editor of New America Media. His latest book is, The impeachment of President Trump?

Exxon Shareholders Push Company To Be More Transparent About Climate Risks,"WASHINGTON — As news spread that President Donald Trump reportedly plans to remove the U.S. from the historic /www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paris-agreement-signed_us_5717f604e4b0479c59d6ec2f""}}"" data-beacon-parsed=""true"">Paris Agreement on climate change, Exxon Mobil Corp. shareholders voted in favor of a measure calling for the company to disclose the risks that climate change policies pose to its business. Sixty-two percent of shareholders voted in favor of the nonbinding proposal. It requests that Exxon report on the financial impacts of the Paris pact’s goal of cutting carbon emissions in an effort to keep global temperatures from warming an addition 2 degrees Celsius. New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, trustee of the New York Common Retirement Fund, said in a statement that the vote was “an unprecedented victory for investors in the fight to ensure a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy.” The fund holds nearly $1 billion in Exxon shares.  “Climate change is one of the greatest long-term risks we face in our portfolio and has direct impact on the core business of ExxonMobil,” DiNapoli said. “The burden is now on ExxonMobil to respond swiftly and demonstrate that it takes shareholder concerns about climate risk seriously.” Kathy Mulvey, the climate accountability campaign manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, called Wednesday’s vote “groundbreaking.” A similar proposal put forth last year had received support from only 38 percent of Exxon shareholders. “It’s a really strong signal to Exxon Mobil and to other major fossil fuel companies that investors want to see them get serious about a low-carbon future,” she told HuffPost. “It has implications that go beyond Exxon itself, particularly at a time when we’re hearing ongoing waffling by the Trump administration about whether the U.S. will stay in the Paris agreement. It shows that the business and investor community is serious about making the commitment to a low-carbon future.” Exxon had urged investors to vote against the resolution that shareholders approved during their annual meeting in Dallas.  CEO David Wood said Wednesday that the company believes the “risks of climate change are serious and warrant action — thoughtful action.” However, he argued that Exxon has “adequately assessed the potential impacts of future policy developments” and shared those findings with its investors.  Exxon’s board will now consider the climate resolution, Wood said.  The vote indicates that Exxon shareholders “are finally acknowledging what the company still refuses to — that the age of oil of nearly over,” said Naomi Ages, a senior climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace USA.   Exxon has faced mounting legal trouble in recent years, including investigations by multiple state attorneys general looking into whether the company lied to the public and its investors about the risks of climate change. Those probes stem from InsideClimate News and Los Angeles Times reports indicating that Exxon executives were aware of the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions but had funded research to cover up those risks and block solutions. Exxon is also among several oil and gas companies that have warned Trump against withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris agreement, a deal it called an “effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change” and the “first major international accord” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous media outlets reported Wednesday that Trump plans to withdraw from the Paris accord, a move that would put the U.S. in the same category as Syria and Nicaragua.  Woods said Wednesday that the company stands by its position on the Paris climate agreement.  “[Climate change] is a global challenge which requires global participation,” he said. “We think the advantages of the Paris framework is it engages and involves communities all around the world, countries all around the world, irrespective of their economic development.” This story has been updated throughout. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Claire's Is Entering A New Chapter In Life: Bankruptcy,"First Toys R Us, and now Claire’s. Mainstay institutions within malls across America are entering a new chapter in life: bankruptcy.  Cheap jewelry giant Claire’s filed for Chapter 11 on Monday, hoping to rid itself of substantial debt, the company announced. Claire’s maintained that it was approaching the bankruptcy filing from a position of strength, using Chapter 11 to restructure its budget sheet, not its operations. So jewelry fans and ear-piercing enthusiasts, fear not! Claire’s plans to continue its store operations per usual throughout the Chapter 11 process. And the U.S. bankruptcy filing pertains only to Claire’s stores in America, not the company’s international subsidiaries. Still, Claire’s, which says it’s pierced over 100 million ears worldwide, plans to close some underperforming stores and renegotiate leases, according to The New York Times. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2018 with $1.9 billion less in debt.  While mall traffic has been declining over the years with the rise of online shopping, Claire’s says its beloved ear-piercing service is internet-proof since it cannot be replicated on the web. The company says it pierced 3.5 million ears in the U.S. last year. News of Claire’s Chapter 11 filing comes on the heels of reports that fellow mall tenant Toys R Us may close all of its operations in America, which could affect roughly 33,000 U.S. workers.

Researchers See Possible North Korea Link To Global Cyber Attack,"Cyber security researchers have found technical evidence they said could link North Korea with the global WannaCry “ransomware” cyber attack that has infected more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries since Friday. Symantec (SYMC.O) and Kaspersky Lab said on Monday that some code in an earlier version of the WannaCry software had also appeared in programs used by the Lazarus Group, which researchers from many companies have identified as a North Korea-run hacking operation. “This is the best clue we have seen to date as to the origins of WannaCry,” Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner told Reuters. Both firms said it was too early to tell whether North Korea was involved in the attacks, based on the evidence that was published on Twitter by Google security researcher Neel Mehta. The attacks, which slowed on Monday, are among the fastest-spreading extortion campaigns on record. The research will be closely followed by law enforcement agencies around the world, including Washington, where President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser said on Monday that both foreign nations and cyber criminals were possible culprits. The two security firms said they needed to study the code more and asked for others to help with the analysis. Hackers do reuse code from other operations, so even copied lines fall well short of proof. U.S. and European security officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that it was too early to say who might be behind the attacks, but they did not rule out North Korea as a suspect. FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), another large cyber security firm, said it was also investigating a possible link. “The similarities we see between malware linked to that group and WannaCry are not unique enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator,” FireEye researcher John Miller said. The Lazarus hackers, acting for impoverished North Korea, have been more brazen in pursuit of financial gain than others, and have been blamed for the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank, according to some cyber security firms. The North Korean mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment. Regardless of the source of the attack, investors piled into cyber security stocks on Monday, betting that governments and corporations will spend more to upgrade their defenses. SMALL PAYOUT The perpetrators had raised less than $70,000 from users paying to regain access to their computers, according to Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert. “We are not aware if payments have led to any data recovery,” Bossert said, adding that no U.S. federal government systems had been affected. WannaCry demanded ransoms starting at $300, in line with many cyber extortion campaigns, which keep pricing low so more victims will pay. Still, some security experts said they were not sure if the motive of WannaCry was primarily to make money, noting that large cyber extortion campaigns typically generate millions of dollars of revenue. “I believe that this was spread for the purpose of causing as much damage as possible,” said Matthew Hickey, a co-founder of British cyber consulting firm Hacker House. The countries most affected by WannaCry to date are Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and India, according to Czech security firm Avast. The number of infections has fallen dramatically since Friday’s peak when more than 9,000 computers were being hit per hour. Earlier on Monday, Chinese traffic police and schools reported they had been targeted as the attack rolled into Asia for the new work week, but no there were no major disruptions. Authorities in Europe and the United States turned their attention to preventing hackers from spreading new versions of the virus. Shares in firms that provide cyber security services rose sharply, led by Israel’s Cyren Ltd (CYRN.O) and U.S.-based FireEye (FEYE.O). Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) closed up 2.3 percent and was the second-biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as investors focused more on opportunities that the attack presented for technology firms than the risk it posed to corporations. Morgan Stanley, in upgrading the stock, said Cisco should benefit from network spending driven by security needs. POLITICAL TOPIC Beyond the immediate need to shore up computer defenses, the attack turned cyber security into a political topic in Europe and the United States, including discussion of the role national governments play. In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) President Brad Smith confirmed what researchers already widely concluded: The attack made use of a hacking tool built by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that had leaked online in April. He poured fuel on a long-running debate over how government intelligence services should balance their desire to keep software flaws secret - in order to conduct espionage and cyber warfare - against sharing those flaws with technology companies to better secure the internet. On Monday, Bossert sought to distance the NSA from any blame. “This was not a tool developed by the NSA to hold ransom data. This was a tool developed by culpable parties, potentially criminals or foreign nation-states, that were put together in such a way as to deliver phishing emails, put it into embedded documents, and cause infection, encryption and locking,” Bossert said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting the technology’s link to the U.S. spy service, said it should be “discussed immediately on a serious political level.” “Once they’re let out of the lamp, genies of this kind, especially those created by intelligence services, can later do damage to their authors and creators,” he said.

Twitter Inches Forward In Fight Against Abuse,"Twitter trolls be warned: Mute is coming for you.  On Wednesday, the social media company unveiled a series of new measures in its fight against harassment on the site, which ran particularly rampant during the 2016 presidential campaign. The changes include increased automatic screening for abusive tweets, more powerful filtering options for users and greater transparency from Twitter about how it’s dealing with abusive accounts. Of the three, users will likely appreciate the expanded filtering options the most, particularly the powerful new “mute” features. According to Twitter, users will be able to mute specific phrases, keywords and conversations from their timelines. They’ll also be able to choose how long the mute is enforced, whether it’s one day or indefinitely. (So, this would be good when, for example, your whole timeline is tweeting about a show that you don’t watch.) Tweets coming from accounts without profile pictures, verified email addresses and phone numbers can all be screened: The other features announced Wednesday should require less effort on the part of the user. Ideally, users won’t notice them at all ― they’ll just experience less harassment on their timelines. For Twitter, that will mean relying more on algorithms to flag and mute abusive profiles. “We’re working to identify accounts as they’re engaging in abusive behavior, even if this behavior hasn’t been reported to us,” the company said in a release. “We aim to only act on accounts when we’re confident, based on our algorithms, that their behavior is abusive. Since these tools are new we will sometimes make mistakes, but know that we are actively working to improve and iterate on them.” The anti-harassment moves come amid broader turmoil at the company, which is scrambling to increase its user base and engagement rate in a bid to grow revenue and pacify investors.  Twitter’s stock has plunged from a high of $69 per share shortly after its 2013 initial public offering to about $15 a share at present. Though rumors abound of a potential takeover, would-be suitors like Google, Disney and Salesforce (which were all said to be interested at one point) want to see the harassment abate first.",TECH,TECH
"So, Chris Christie Is No Longer A Candidate For This Sought-After Post","This controversial armchair quarterback says he benched himself. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Sunday disputed a report that New York sports radio station WFAN removed him as a candidate to replace iconic host Mike Francesa. The governor, who has filled in at the station and was known to be in line for a possible full-time gig, told outlets in a statement that he was the one who pulled the plug on his jock-talk prospects. “After considering the other options that I have been presented with for post-gubernatorial employment, I declined their request to do additional shows,” Christie said. “I made station executives aware that while I would be happy to continue to fill in ... when available, that they should no longer consider me as a candidate interested in any job at WFAN when I leave the governorship. I made that clear to them prior to leaving for my family vacation two weeks ago.” Citing anonymous sources from WFAN, the New York Daily News on Saturday reported that the station gave Christie the boot from consideration after Francesa is expected to leave in December. The station had earlier indicated interest in the governor. Christie recently made news for a run-in with a fan at a Milwaukee Brewers game. Looks like he’ll be having fewer on-air conflicts with fans such as “Mike from Montclair” as well.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Don’t Blame The Batteries For Every Lithium-Ion Explosion,"By Tim Moynihan for WIRED.  Lithium-ion batteries have been making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The latest marquee moment involved a pair of exploding headphones on a plane. That incendiary incident came hot on the heels of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 (double) recall and major issues with “hoverboard” batteries. You can’t chalk it all up to incompetence, either. Even rocket scientists have trouble keeping lithium-ion batteries in check. By nature, lithium-ion batteries are dangerous. Inside, the main line of defense against short circuiting is a thin and porous slip of polypropylene that keeps the electrodes from touching. If that separator is breached, the electrodes come in contact, and things get very hot very quickly. The batteries are also filled with a flammable electrolyte, one that can combust when it heats up, then really get going once oxygen hits it. Not scary enough? That liquid is mixed with a compound that can burn your skin. RELATED: How Lithium-Ion Batteries Turn Into Skin-Searing Firebombs So why even use them? Lithium-ion batteries are incredibly efficient. They stuff freakish amounts of energy in a tiny package, one that can keep a phone or laptop running all day. Li-ion power cells are also a very mature technology. The first rechargeable lithium-ion batteries were used in Sony’s Handycams more than 25 years ago, and now there are dozens of battery suppliers around the world. If you’re making a camera, car, plane, or fitness tracker, including a Li-ion cell is generally a plug-and-play step in the manufacturing process. But unlike most mature tech, they seem to get more volatile as time goes on. That’s because we demand higher-capacity batteries in slimmer packages at cheaper prices. The symptoms may be the same—they explode—but many factors are contributing to lithium-ion’s unwanted time in the spotlight. Production Flaws With all these exploding batteries, the no-brainer diagnosis is something must be wrong with the ways the battery is built. That is often the case, but as Samsung’s Note 7 saga shows, pinpointing the specific problem isn’t so simple. The initial recall involved phones with batteries made by Samsung itself, ones that didn’t have enough space between the battery’s protective pouch and electrodes inside. That squeeze bent the electrodes in some batteries, causing them to come into contact and short-circuit. But once those phones were recalled, replacement devices with “safer” batteries from another company had separate issues. Many weren’t insulated well, while others had jagged edges inside that damaged the all-important separator. That also caused short circuiting, but for entirely different reasons. Design Flaws  Most modern gadgets are designed to be as slim, light, and sleek as possible. That can wreak havoc on an otherwise well-built battery, especially a high-capacity cell packed into a small body. Pressure from the hardware surrounding the battery can cause damage to the electrodes or the separator and lead to short circuiting. Inadequate venting or thermal management can cause the flammable electrolyte inside the battery to heat up. Once it’s too hot, chemical reactions can cause it to heat up even more and spiral out of control. It’s a situation called thermal runaway that often ends in an explosion or fire—and then a bigger one once oxygen comes into contact with the chaos. User-Supplied Damage Even if a gadget is designed well, dropping it and subjecting it to long-term wear and tear can do damage to its volatile power source. The best way to tell if your battery is damaged is if it looks all puffed up—evidence that the chemicals inside the battery are producing gas in a way that they shouldn’t. That swelling also creates its own pressure with the battery housing, which could lead to a puncture or conflagration. Unfortunately, most phones these days have a sealed-in battery, and taking the device apart to inspect it involves breaking the warranty. If the external case of your phone appears to be pushing apart or feels abnormally hot to the touch, it’s best to be careful and bring it in for inspection. RELATED: Inside the Race to Build the Battery of Tomorrow Problems With the Charger Think twice about picking up a cheap, no-name charging cable if you left yours at home. There’s a reason why some of those cables and wall warts are so cheap: To hit that crazy-low price, the companies that make them often skimp on insulation, shirk safety laws, and skip power-management features. It can lead to electrocution, an exploding charger, or an inferno in your phone. Industry Pressure and Competition If a company can save a few pennies on each battery, that can translate to millions or billions in profit. As a result, many lithium-ion battery manufacturers cut corners in order to price their cells more cheaply. The materials may have imperfections, causing damage in the already-thin separator. Maybe they can save a few bucks by skimping on insulation or quality control. These things were likely a major cause of those hoverboard fires: The first models on the market were expensive, and their popularity bred knockoffs with cheap prices and even cheaper internals. Crowdfunding and affordable components have democratized the consumer-electronics industry, but savings often come at the expense of safety.

Don Blankenship's New Xenophobic Campaign Ad Sparks Twitter Fury,"West Virginia GOP Senate candidate Don Blankenship has amped up the xenophobic rhetoric with his latest campaign ad. In a spot posted online Thursday, the former coal CEO repeated the derogatory term “China people” in a swipe against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people,” Blankenship said in the ad, reportedly set to air on TV in West Virginia starting Friday. “While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich,” continued Blankenship, who served time in prison for safety violations that contributed to the fatal 2010 Upper Big Branch mining disaster. “In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars,” he added. Check out the ad here: What in the world did I just watch pic.twitter.com/4eudpGAxp0 Blankenship, whose own fiancée reportedly was born in China, caught heat earlier this week after suggesting in a radio interview that McConnell may have a conflict of interest when it comes to foreign relations because his father-in-law — shipping company chairman James Chao — “is a wealthy Chinaperson.” Blankenship on Tuesday defended his use of the term, which was used to dehumanize Chinese immigrants arriving in the U.S. in the 19th century. “I don’t see this insinuation by the press that there’s something racist about saying a ‘Chinaperson,’” he said during a primary debate. “Some people are Korean persons, and some of them are African persons. That’s not any slander there.” Stephen Colbert ridiculed Blankenship’s earlier campaign ad, in which he called McConnell “Cocaine Mitch,” on Thursday’s “Late Show.”: People on Twitter ripped Blankenship’s inclusion of the “China people” term in his latest ad: “China-people”... when you want to be gender inclusive, but still racist.

"'Ooho,' Tiny Edible Water Blob, Could Be A Major Solution To Plastic Bottle Waste (VIDEO)","From Mother Nature Network's Bryan Nelson: What's one solution to the growing problem of plastic water bottle waste? A trio of Spanish design students think they have the answer, and it involves creating a ""water bottle"" that you can eat, reports Co.Exist.

Designers Rodrigo García González, Guillaume Couche and Pierre Paslier call their creation ""Ooho,"" a gelatinous blob that is actually a membrane that encapsulates water like a bladder. When you're thirsty, just puncture the membrane and drink. Or, if you also have an appetite, just pop a bite-sized Ooho in your mouth and chomp down for a burst of hydration. The gooey membrane, made from brown algae and calcium chloride, is edible, hygienic and biodegradable.

The Ooho globule is formed through a process called ""spherification,"" a methodology first pioneered in 1946 and still utilized by some chefs in modern cuisine. Water is frozen into ice before being encapsulated to ease the process and prevent the water from mixing with the membrane ingredients. The bag-like containers are also incredibly cheap — each one costs just 2 cents to make, and they could even be concocted at home.

""Anyone can make them in their kitchen, modifying and innovating the recipe,"" said co-designer García. ""It's not DIY but CIY — cook it yourself.""

Similar products have already made it to the market; an edible food delivery system called WikiPearl is available at select Whole Foods markets. Ooho is the first such container designed specifically for replacing water bottles, however.

One immediate use for the Ooho water containers could be for running sports events. Runners often hydrate by grabbing paper cups from spectators as they run, creating a lot of trash. Ooho offers an waste-free alternative; it could even be infused with electrolytes to give competitors an athletic edge.

The design was a winner of the second annual Lexus Design Award and will also be featured during Milan Design Week. You can view users testing out the Ooho water containers in the following video by Fast Company:",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Microsoft And Amazon Have A Plan For Driverless Cars,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Amazon.com and Microsoft are in talks to supply cloud computing to digital mapping business HERE, owned by a group of German carmakers developing self-driving cars, sources familiar with the matter said. Amazon is also considering becoming a shareholder in HERE, two sources said. Last year, carmakers BMW, Audi and Mercedes struck a 2.5 billion euro ($2.85 billion) deal to buy Nokia's HERE maps business. Intelligent mapping systems supply information to control self-driving cars, which are equipped with street-scanning sensors to measure traffic and road conditions. This location data can in turn be shared with other map users. ""Amazon would take a stake as part of a broader deal to lock them in as a provider of cloud computing services,"" one source familiar with the talks said. ""Microsoft is also interested in closer ties to HERE,"" another source familiar with the talks said. Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not respond to requests to comment. Audi, the premium brand owned by Volkswagen, Daimler - the parent company of Mercedes-Benz - and BMW declined to comment on talks with potential new partners. The consortium needs cloud computing providers to manage the mountains of data collected from sensors on thousands of Mercedes, BMW and Audi cars. These digital maps allow cars to avoid traffic jams or hazards such as ice. ""The new owners Audi, Daimler and BMW have said from the start that they are open for new partners to join,"" BMW said in a statement. ""We have noticed that there is lots of interest not only from potential partners from within the automotive industry, but also from other sectors."" The consortium has started negotiations with potential new partners, including both rival carmakers and potential technology suppliers. Having more carmakers on board will spread the cost of investments required to develop the digital mapping business, and could improve the volume of data about traffic information being fed into the map database from vehicles on the road. Renault and automotive supplier Continental have both expressed interest. Continental said on Thursday a decision on whether to buy a stake in HERE would be made within the next few months. Ford is also among the companies interested in taking a stake in the HERE consortium, a third auto industry source said on Thursday. Asked whether Ford was in talks with the group about taking a stake in HERE, a spokesman for the company said: ""We have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects."" He declined further comment. Self-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have estimated.

"Russians Had Ability To Change Voter Data But Didn’t, Report Says","Russian-linked hackers had the ability to alter or delete voter registration information in a handful of states during the 2016 election, but there’s no evidence they did so, according to a Senate report released Tuesday.  The Department of Homeland Security has previously publicly acknowledged that Russians scanned systems in 21 states and were able to “penetrate” a handful. But cybersecurity experts say the report Tuesday from the Senate intelligence committee offers new details on what exactly Russian-backed hackers could have done once they got inside election systems. “In at least six states, the Russian-affiliated cyber actors went beyond scanning and conducted malicious access attempts on voting-related websites. In a small number of states, Russian-affiliated cyber actors were able to gain access to restricted elements of election infrastructure,” the report says. “In a small number of states, these cyber actors were in a position to, at a minimum, alter or delete voter registration data; however, they did not appear to be in a position to manipulate individual votes or aggregate vote totals.” The report, part of the Senate intelligence committee’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, says the committee saw “no evidence” any votes or voter registration information was altered or changed. “The report paints a clearer picture of the overall Russian cyber campaign than I’ve previously seen, leaving no doubt that the voter registration system attacks are just the beginning of what we can expect,” J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, wrote in an email. He added that the report notes the attacks may have been a practice run for more sophisticated attacks in the future. “We knew that there was an actual breach of the Illinois voter registration system (but apparently no success in altering registration data),” Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, noted in an email. “I am not aware of any other state that has acknowledged cyber actors gained access to restricted elements of the election infrastructure.” Altering voter registration could mean a number of things, including potentially removing people from the voter rolls. “If jurisdictions are not prepared for this kind of thing, it could lead to long lines and lost votes,” he said. States can take steps to mitigate confusion, he added, by regularly auditing their rolls, backing up information and having a contingency plan in place on Election Day. The Senate report says that the Russians undertook “a wide variety of intelligence-related activities targeting the U.S. voting process” beginning at least as early as 2014 and continuing to Election Day. Those activities included “operations likely aimed at preparing to discredit the integrity of the U.S. voting process and election results.” The report is based on information self-reported by the states as well as assessments from DHS and the FBI. The committee conceded there were “collection gaps” in its assessment of Russian activity and that there may have been more undetected activity. Halderman said he believes the gaps “very likely” included attacks on vendors who supply vital election infrastructure to the states. A National Security Agency document leaked last year said Russians likely hacked one election vendor. The company denies it was breached. The Senate report expresses concern that the companies that provide actual election equipment to different jurisdictions could be a ripe target for hacking. “State local, territorial, tribal, and federal government authorities have very little insight into the cyber security practices of many of these vendors, and while the Election Assistance Commission issues guidelines for Security, abiding by those guidelines is currently voluntary,” the report says. In the lead-up to Election Day, DHS inadequately responded to the cyberthreat, the report said, and the agency was “not well-positioned” to assist states in responding to a cyberthreat from Russia. While it attempted to contact state information technology officials about the general election security threat, the agency was unable to convey its specificity and severity. The report notes that the agency was caught in a kind of Catch-22 ― it wanted to inform states about a very real threat without creating the impression that U.S. election infrastructure is vulnerable to a breach. The report notes that DHS and the states have made improvements and are working together more effectively now to address election security. Congress also recently approved $380 million for election security in states. The committee also offered a series of recommendations to enhance security, including improving information sharing between states and DHS, conducting risk-limiting audits, installing monitoring sensors on state election systems and requiring that any voting machine purchased in the future have no Wi-Fi capabilities and leave a paper trail. Candice Hoke, a co-founder of the Center for Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection at Ohio’s Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, said Americans should now presume that hostile adversaries know where vulnerabilities are in U.S. election infrastructure. “They may use this info strategically in 2018,” she wrote in an email, “or could test disruptive activities in 2019 in preparation for 2020.”",POLITICS,TECH
"Ronny Jackson Not Returning As Trump's Personal Doctor, Reports Say","Dr. Ronny Jackson, the president’s former personal physician and the short-lived nominee for Veterans Affairs secretary, will not return to his old job, media outlets reported on Sunday. Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, withdrew his name from consideration to lead the VA last week amid a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee investigation into allegations that he created a “hostile work environment” and improperly distributed medication. He was also accused of “excessive drinking on the job” and crashing a government vehicle. On Sunday, Politico reported that Jackson would not return to his old role as President Donald Trump’s personal physician, citing two White House officials. The news was later confirmed by The Washington Post and The New York Times. It’s unclear if Jackson will remain on staff at the White House medical unit or if he’ll depart the administration. Dr. Sean Conley, a veteran of the Navy who took over as Trump’s personal physician as Jackson pursued the VA nomination, will continue in the role. Jackson has been a White House physician since 2006. He has denied the charges first made public by the office of Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), calling them “completely false and fabricated.” “If they had any merit, I would not have been selected, promoted and entrusted to serve in such a sensitive and important role as physician to three presidents over the past 12 years,” Jackson said in a statement last week. But the nomination had already drawn skepticism from some lawmakers who worried that Jackson’s lack of experience would imperil the government’s second-largest federal agency. Tester’s office has yet to release any documents supporting the accusations against the doctor. Last Friday, the Secret Service said it had uncovered no evidence related to a specific charge that agents had intervened when Jackson allegedly tried to bother then-President Barack Obama during a 2015 overseas trip. Trump pounced on that news during a rally on Saturday, warning Tester that he knew “things” about the senator that he “could say, too ... and if I said them, he’d never be elected again.” In a post on Twitter, Trump also called on Tester to resign: Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The..... ....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester! Jackson is still up for a promotion to become a 2-star admiral. Senators will consider the allegations before awarding it, The Times reported.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Donald Trump's New York Modeling Agency To Shut Down,"The president of the United States is getting out of the modeling business: Trump Models is closing down. Revenues at the New York-based modeling agency were expected to take another hit with the defection this month of a key manager who was taking several models to start up a new operation, The Washington Post reported. It’s the most recent loss of management and models that began last year as Trump’s presidential campaign heated up. President Donald Trump has an 85 percent stake in the business launched by the Trump Organization in 1999, according to his personal financial disclosure filings released last year. He reported earning $1.9 million from the operation. “The Trump Organization is choosing to exit the modeling industry,” company president Corinne Nicolas told associates over the weekend in an email obtained by Mother Jones. A Trump Organization representative also told The New York Post that the modeling agency was closing up shop. “While we enjoyed many years of success, we are focused on our core businesses in the real estate and golf industries and the rapid expansion of our hospitality division,” said the spokesperson. Over the years, the agency has represented top models including Jerry Hall, Tatjana Patitz, Yasmin Lebon and Carmen Dell’Orefice, among many others. But it triggered controversy during Trump’s presidential campaign when Mother Jones spoke to three models who weren’t U.S. citizens who revealed they had worked illegally as immigrants when the agency booked jobs for them without obtaining proper work visas. The magazine also found financial and immigration records showing a fourth former model appeared to have worked illegally in the U.S. Canadian model Rachel Blais told the magazine last year that she booked jobs in the U.S. without a work visa, including for appearances on Trump’s “Apprentice” reality TV program. She called the agency “the most crooked I’ve ever worked for.”  The news emerged as Trump was railing on the campaign trail against immigrants working illegally in the U.S. Last September, then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) called for an investigation into Trump’s business following the magazine’s revelations.  #RUNWAY #FW2017Amelia Rami x @marcjacobs...#TrumpModels#AmeliaRami#NYFW#MarcJacobs pic.twitter.com/o9GgcFkOjz",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
A Melting Antarctica Could Sink The World's Coastlines Faster Than Predicted,"A new paper says seas could rise more than six feet by 2100. Many cities, including New York, Boston and Hong Kong, would be partially underwater. The worst effects could be avoided if we slash or stop carbon emissions. A new report nearly doubles previous predictions for sea level rise if global emissions continue unabated, portending a doomsday scenario for many of the world's coastal cities. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, looks toward the ice sheets of Antarctica, which by themselves may contribute more than three feet to sea level rise by 2100. Taken with other melting regions, including Greenland, seas could rise more than six feet, or two meters, by the end of the century. David Pollard of Penn State University and co-author Rob DeConto said the ""dire"" predictions are nearly double those recently used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a worst-case scenario if humanity fails to curb emissions. Dozens of low-lying metropolises, including Hong Kong, New York and Sydney, would be vulnerable to these rising seas. The authors warn that places like Boston could be faced with a sea level rise of more than five feet in the next century alone. Pollard said other potential effects, similar to the damaging storm surge caused by Hurricane Sandy, could contribute to the ballooning estimates for future flood losses. A study published last month found sea levels were rising at the fastest rate since the founding of ancient Rome 2,800 years ago, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels. The authors of that report noted without the impact of humans, seas would be rising less rapidly, or possibly falling. In an interview with The Guardian, DeConto said global warming could force ""retreat"" from cities, rather than the ""engineering of defenses"" to avoid the worst effects of sea level rise. But the new models cited in Pollard and DeConto's study, which use historical data from 130,000 years ago and 3 million years ago, when temperatures were warmer and seas were higher, could make a fight against the tides all for naught. The authors expanded the sea level rise estimates to the year 2500, and found that Antarctica could cause more than 50 feet of sea level rise alone. Despite the doomsday-esque prediction, the planet still holds some hope to address the growing concerns. DeConto noted in a statement that if humans are able to slash emissions, most of the Antarctic would remain frozen. Last year's landmark climate accord forged in Paris could provide the groundwork toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. World leaders have pledged to keep global warming below a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius. But the world isn't there yet, and global temperature records -- including the one set in February, the warmest such month on record -- continue to be broken.",SCIENCE,ENVIRONMENT

Deputy Interior Secretary Keeps Meeting With Lobbyists For Client of His Former Firm,"WASHINGTON — David Bernhardt, the deputy secretary of the Interior Department, met late last year with a trio of lobbyists for MGM Resorts International, the casino-resort giant that his longtime former employer also represents.  The meeting with lobbyists from Ballard Partners, which came two months after Bernhardt met with another lobbyist for MGM Resorts, raises still more ethical concerns involving the former energy lobbyist at a time when Secretary Ryan Zinke and his team are facing mounting criticism over their spending, travel and apparent conflicts of interest. Bernhardt is barred from participating in matters involving his former employer, lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber & Schreck, per the ethics agreement he signed last year. But, according to a newly released calendar, Bernhardt had a Dec. 19 meeting with Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who raised millions of dollars for President Donald Trump’s campaign and was hired by MGM in March 2017 to lobby the Department of the Interior on issues including “Indian Gaming & Expansion Policy.” Joining Ballard at the meeting were Sylvester Lukis and Dan McFaul, who are both partners in the lobbying firm. All three are registered to represent MGM, which paid the firm $350,000 for its services over the last year, according to lobbying disclosure reports. The calendar does not say what their meeting with Bernhardt was about.  Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt worked for eight years prior to being sworn in at the Interior Department in August, has also been representing MGM on this issue since he was with the firm. The meeting with Ballard Partners came two months after Bernhardt met with Gale Norton, another lobbyist for MGM, as HuffPost first reported. The casino hired Norton, the interior secretary under George W. Bush, to lobby the department specifically on MGM’s opposition to a proposed casino partnership between two Connecticut tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot and the Mohegan. MGM, which is prepared to open a casino in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, views the tribes’ casino as competition. Because the tribes’ proposed casino would not be on Indian land, federal approval is required. Larry Jensen, a lawyer at Brownstein Hyatt and former Bernhardt colleague on the firm’s energy, environment and natural resources team, also met and held several phone calls in December 2017 and January 2018 with Bernhardt’s right-hand man, James Cason, the associate deputy secretary. Cason, Jensen, Bernhardt and Norton all worked in the Interior Department in the mid-2000s.  McFaul denies he and his colleagues talked with Bernhardt about MGM. “We’re aware that he’s recused from this matter, and we respect that,” McFaul told HuffPost.  According to McFaul, the meeting was about a different tribal casino that his firm represents, SkyBoat Gaming. Ballard, Lukis and McFaul are each listed as a lobbyist for SkyBoat.  Lobbyists from Ballard Partners met with Bernhardt on two previous occasions, in September and October. The deputy secretary’s calendar specified the meeting topics ― Everglades Agricultural Area and Skyboat Gaming, respectively ― while the December meeting did not state a specific purpose.  Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for the progressive watchdog group Public Citizen, told HuffPost that Bernhardt’s meeting with Ballard lends further evidence to the suspicion that Bernhardt is not complying with his ethics agreements. “Bernhardt’s frequent meetings with lobbyists who are deeply entangled in the turf war between MGM and the tribal casinos, especially the meeting with the MGM lobbyist, gives every appearance that Bernhardt is personally involved in negotiating public policies that directly impact MGM and his former lobby firm,” Holman said. Had Bernhardt met only with Ballard Partners, which lobbies the federal government for numerous clients other than MGM, the Interior Department could put up a credible denial that the parties discussed the casino, Holman said. But his previous meeting with Norton, who solely represents MGM in its fight against the proposed tribal casino, would cast doubt on that argument. “This ‘drain the swamp’ was nothing but campaign rhetoric,” Holman said. Meanwhile, MGM’s lobbying blitz seems to have been successful. In September, the Interior Department refused to make a decision on the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan casino within the required 45 days, a deadline that expired just two weeks after Zinke hosted Ballard and several other lobbyists for a social gathering on his office balcony overlooking the National Mall, Politico reported. The tribes have filed suit against the Interior Department seeking a firm yes or no on the project. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment Wednesday.

How Do You Know You Have A Good Consumer Lawyer? Here Are The Signs,"Diana Winkler suspected she'd found a great lawyer for her consumer case. The telltale signs were there: His genuine concern for justice, his willingness to take her case on a contingency basis, and his attention to detail. ""He made sure all the loose ends were tied up,"" she remembers. Winkler, a musician from Scottsdale, Ariz., had an airtight case, too. She'd been scammed by a timeshare company. That's a slam dunk, or as her attorney might declare in open court, suspendisse cursus velit vel slam. (Actually, I just made that up, but ""slam dunk"" looks so much better when it's translated into Latin, doesn't it?) ""When we finally got our passwords and packets from the timeshare company, we found out there was no availability to book our vacation -- for the next three years,"" she says. ""It was past the period that you could cancel."" Her hunch about the lawyer was accurate. Her lawyer negotiated a release from the contract and she was out only $2,000, a price she was more than willing to pay. ""It was worth every penny to be rid of that timeshare,"" she says. But how do you know when you have a good lawyer, like Winkler? There's no Good Housekeeping seal of approval in the legal profession, beyond belonging to their state bar association. Here are a few signs you've found a great attorney: If they check out with all your sources You can find a good lawyer based on referrals -- a tried-and-true method of finding legal advice -- but that's so 20th century. Matthew Eason, an attorney with the law firm Eason & Tambornini, says consumer reviews are an excellent way of finding competent legal representation. ""Check a consumer referral site such as Yelp or Avvo,"" he says. ""That's the place to start."" Once you narrow your search, find out what that attorney's peers think of him or her. You can do that on sites like SuperLawyers or Martindale. (Note, for some listings, lawyers pay for a higher ranking, so take these services with a grain or two of salt.) ""If the attorney has solid reviews from fellow consumers, as well as his or her peers, then you have likely chosen a good lawyer,"" adds Eason. If the lawyer is a real expert You can get any lawyer to whisper sweet nothings into your ear about your case, but does the attorney really know the subject matter? ""The lawyer needs to know the space,"" says Braden Perry, a former federal enforcement attorney now in private practice. ""They must understand how the differing local, state, and federal consumer protection agencies may be a better avenue and they must provide all available options for a consumer."" As a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission attorney, he recalls many instances of outside lawyers trying to keep the claims “in house” as opposed to leading a consumer to an agency that may be the best result for the client, without causing the client additional legal fees. A real expert knows the regulatory environment and how your case fits into it. If you don't see any warning signs And there are so many of them, you could fill a book. Winkler would have been right to recoil when an attorney started talking money before justice, or promised a big win with hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. David Pressler, who owns a construction company in Davie, Fla., needed to sue the county recently because of an alleged consumer rights violation. He started by contacting the Florida Attorney General, which suggested he hire an attorney. So he hired a law firm, paying it a $6,000 retainer. ""Once the firm got my money it then declared that there is no case,"" he recalls. ""My story stinks."" You can usually get a pretty good read before you send a check. If calls and emails aren't being returned or the lawyer comes off as arrogant or dismissive, you might be dealing with someone who only cares about a check. You need to look elsewhere for representation. There are other ways of determining if the lawyer you're considering is not only incompetent but unethical. For example, Florida releases a list of disciplinary actions. If you see an attorney on that list, you might want to think twice about hiring that person. ""Trust your gut,"" advises Bridget Garrity, an attorney based in Torrington, Conn. ""If you don’t like the lawyer -- run!"" Of course, part of the problem with any legal service is that so much money is at stake. Pressler spent six grand only to find out he didn't have a case. Winkler lost $2,000 -- and she's happy. A prepaid legal service plan or a pro-bono lawyer can help offset or eliminate some of those expenses, but why shouldn't everyone have equal access to the legal system? Now that's a discussion worth having. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems. Contact him with your questions on his advocacy website.

Blue Origin Rocket Sticks Third Landing Test,"Jeff Bezos' space transportation company Blue Origin successfully launched and landed for the third time a suborbital rocket capable of carrying six passengers, taking another step on its path in developing reusable boosters, the company said on Saturday. The New Shepard rocket and capsule blasted off from a launch site in West Texas on Saturday at an undisclosed time, and landed minutes later back at a landing pad, the company said. The capsule, which was flying autonomously, parachuted to a nearby site and was recovered, the company said. ""Perfect booster landing,"" Bezos wrote on Twitter. Blue Origin declined to comment on the test but said on Twitter, ""Congrats Blue team on today's (flight)!"" Saturday's flight marks the third successful launch-and-land for the rocket, with similar missions completed in January and November. Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), said earlier this month that Blue Origin expects to begin crewed test flights of the New Shepard next year and begin flying paying passengers as early as 2018. Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX are among a handful of companies working to develop rockets that can fly themselves back to Earth so they can be refurbished and flown again, potentially slashing launch costs. For now, Blue Origin is flying suborbital rockets, which lack the speed to put spacecraft into orbit around Earth. The New Shepard rose through clear skies to an apogee of 339,138 feet (103,369 meters), the company said. The engine that powers the pocket restarted at 3,635 feet (1,108 meters) above ground level ""and ramped fast for a successful landing,"" the company said.   (Reporting by Eric M.

The Terrible Truth About How Your Gadgets Die,"The sleek, thin electronics of today are gorgeous to behold -- and hell to recycle. Consumer demand for small devices has helped create a system where products are recycled via shredding, which is very much what it sounds like. Gadgets are essentially pulverized down to their smallest bits, after which relevant parts are scavenged for repurposing. It's neither cost-effective nor sustainable, experts recently told The Huffington Post.  But if design priorities don't change, the system isn't likely to, either.  ""This is a really scary thing,"" Jim Puckett, head of the Basel Action Network, told HuffPost in a recent interview. ""It's not a perfect system to shred things and try to separate them. There's so much that's lost, so much that's contaminated."" The Basel Action Network, or BAN, is a non-governmental organization dedicated to eliminating ""toxic trade."" The group recently made headlines for exposing serious faults in American recycling programs. BAN found that, despite assurances to the contrary, electronics recycling companies were exporting waste to other countries -- contaminating environments with harmful toxins, like the mercury from flat screen monitors. This happens for a pretty simple reason: capital. ""If you're a responsible recycler, you're losing money,"" Puckett told HuffPost. So recyclers behave irresponsibly, collecting devices and outsourcing the hard work of dismantling them. Puckett described undocumented workers in places like Hong Kong who smash devices to recover valuable parts -- without safety equipment. ""They have to breathe in this mercury all day long,"" Puckett said. Puckett said his group will soon challenge tech manufacturers to reveal information to the public about where people should have their gadgets recycled. The overall idea is that tech companies need to shoulder more responsibility when it comes to how their gadgets die. But problems start well before the end of a device's life. An insistence on seamless design makes devices difficult to recycle. Kyle Wiens, who created the repair website iFixit, said Apple is a repeat offender on this point. “An example of a product we really don’t like very much is the iPad,” Wiens told HuffPost. ""In order to make the thing thin, they just glue the front panel on.  ... To get the iPad apart, you have to heat up the glass, but not so much that you damage the LCD."" With iPads -- as with all devices -- there's also the issue of the battery. A charged battery can explode, injuring or even killing the person recycling the device, so the battery must be removed before the device is shredded. And you can't get to an iPad's battery without separating the back part from that stubborn screen. Wiens said Apple has a number of products that create problems for recyclers. The Apple Pencil, a $99 stylus for the iPad Pro, has a battery that simply cannot be removed or replaced, which basically makes the unit impossible to recycle responsibly. While the Pencil represents a slim margin of Apple's overall product portfolio, it speaks to an aesthetic that creates sustainability problems. After all, a product that cannot be easily repaired or recycled needs to be replaced entirely when problems arise. ""Apple designs things not to live a very long time in terms of repairing them,"" Puckett told HuffPost. ""The construction is good. But more and more as they squash the size down, they are making them non-repairable."" Apple says its products are built to last. In a 2014 environmental responsibility report, the company touted its ""take back and recycle"" events in local communities. ""Over 90 percent of the products we collect ... and recycle are not our own,"" the company said in the report, suggesting people want to hold onto or re-sell their Apple gadgets instead of recycling them. The company also allows people to bring in their old devices for recycling at Apple Stores or receive a pre-paid shipping label online to send them back. And no one claims that Apple is the only tech company with these problems. Past editions of Microsoft's Surface computers are actually worse in terms of recyclability, and some releases from Google and Amazon are hardly any better. The latest report from BAN nailed Dell for exporting electronics to developing countries.  All of these tech giants have a lot of work ahead in terms of encouraging responsible recycling. But Apple, an industry leader, carries more influence than its competitors. ""Where Apple goes, everyone else follows,"" Wiens said. ""Their 5 percent of the design influences the other 95 percent heavily."" To wit, Chinese phone-maker Huawei's new device apes the iPhone's design down to a proprietary screw that makes the phone difficult to repair and recycle. Apple would not comment on the record when reached by HuffPost. If you're wondering what you can do to recycle old devices responsibly, right now it's difficult to identify which companies are going to do the right thing with your discarded products. ""Beware like never before,"" Puckett said. ""We don't have a law. These so-called recyclers can make a lot more money by shipping [devices] off to substandard recyclers, or just plain dumping in developing countries."" Another idea? If your device is still usable, donate it to someone in need and avoid the recycling issue completely.",TECH,TECH
Protect Your Inbox From Phishing And Other Email Attacks,"DEFENSES UP By David Nield You may have heard about the recent phishing scam that targeted Google Docs users. People received emails with what looked almost exactly like shared Google Docs, tricking them into granting access to a not-particularly-nice piece of software. From there, the attack could spread to other inboxes. It’s far from the first time users have been attacked through their inboxes and it certainly won’t be the last — sending emails is an easy and low-cost way to fool people into letting their guard down. With that in mind, we’re here to make sure your inbox is tightly buttoned up against phishing attempts, malicious attachments, and more. While we can’t guarantee your safety, these precautions will certainly minimize your risk. Gone phishing Your email of choice, whether Gmail’s web portal or a desktop program like Outlook, already comes with a decent set of security tools. For example, it can snag suspicious emails and automatically toss them into your spam folder. To help out your email client, report spam whenever you find it, which will make it easier for the program to spot something untoward next time. Be wary of any email asking you to click a link, especially if it comes out of the blue without any context — and particularly if it comes from someone you don’t know. Phishing emails can appear to come from trusted contacts, but they often arrive from bizarre-sounding email addresses. To double-check the identity of the sender, and pull up the full header information for suspicious emails. To do this in Gmail, for instance, open the drop-down menu for the message then choose Show original. Unfortunately, even a message that comes from a known contact with the correct email address isn’t necessarily safe. As we’ve said, if one of your friends or family members is hit by a phishing attack, then their valid email address can be used to send you a dangerous message. This means that context is key. Were you expecting a message with a link in it? Does the message make sense? If you’re unsure, it’s worth a quick phone call or message over social media to check the email is what it purports to be. Ask the same questions before opening attachments: Were you expecting them? What’s the context? Hackers are getting better with their craft, but spelling errors and awkward layouts are still tell-tale signs of emails you should steer clear of (the spelling errors are often intentionally left in to evade spam detectors). Another check you can do is to hover over any links or attachments, which might bring up a preview, and alert you to potential problems before you click. If you do click on a link, check that the URL in your browser’s address bar is the one you were expecting, and look for the green padlock symbol that shows the site is secure and trusted. If a sign-in page pops up — or if you’re in any doubt — open a new window and directly type in the URL of the site you think you should be going to, rather than following any embedded links. Browser extensions can also help protect you from phishing attacks. Gmail Sender Icons makes it easier to identify where a message has come from, while Google’s own Password Alert warns you if you’re about to enter your Google account password into a site that isn’t made by Google. Both extensions are well worth installing if you have a Gmail account and use the Chrome browser. Not a Gmail or Chrome user? Look for add-ons for your own email client. Take safety beyond your inbox Protecting against shady links and malicious attachments goes beyond your inbox. For example, most modern-day browsers come with built-in security measures designed to thwart phishing attempts. For best results, make sure your browser of choice is kept up to date at all times (thankfully, browsers usually update automatically). Keep your operating system and your antivirus package up to date as well. If you're using an antivirus program on Windows, then it probably features extra security measures to protect against dangerous attachments that want to do your computer harm, as well as fraudulent links that lead your browser somewhere it shouldn't go. You should also take precautions when using public Wi-Fi, because unsecured networks give hackers more elbow room when it comes to spoofing sites and stealing your information. If you want to be as safe as possible when using the web away from home, we'd recommend sticking to sites that don't deal in sensitive information and installing a VPN package to encrypt any data you do send. Remember standard email security measures As we’ve mentioned before, it’s a good idea to regularly check the plug-ins and add-ons connected to your email inbox. This will reveal any third-party programs that have access to your Gmail or Yahoo or Outlook account. This is actually the recommended clean-up method for the phishing attack we referred to at the start of this article — removing the app’s permissions means it will no longer have control of your inbox. The place to find these add-on tools varies depending on your setup. For Gmail, head to your Google account page and click the link labelled Connected apps & sites. After that, select Manage apps and get rid of anything you don’t use regularly or simply don’t recognize. To be clear, many of these add-ons are useful and perfectly safe. But from a security point of view, it’s a good idea to keep the number of these tools to a minimum. Finally, stay informed: Keep an eye on the tech headlines to track the new types of attack that appear on a regular basis. While Google, Microsoft, and other companies usually deal with the latest dangers quite quickly, you’re better off hearing about a dangerous scam before it hits your inbox rather than after.",TECH,TECH
John McCain Urges Senate To Reject Gina Haspel's Nomination For CIA,"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Wednesday urged the U.S. Senate to reject Gina Haspel’s nomination as director of the CIA. McCain released a statement just hours after Haspel went before the Senate Intelligence Committee for her confirmation hearing. In her testimony, Haspel told lawmakers that she would not restart the agency’s defunct torture program if confirmed to head the CIA, but she repeatedly dodged questions about the morality of the program. In his statement, McCain said he understood “the urgency that drove the decision” to resort to torture as a method of interrogation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “But as I have argued many times, the methods we employ to keep our nation safe must be as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world.” He continued: “I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country and has devoted her professional life to its service and defense. However, Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing. Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying. I believe the Senate should exercise its duty of advice and consent and reject this nomination.” McCain is a fierce opponent of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. The senator, who fought in the Vietnam War, was held in solitary confinement and tortured as a prisoner of war in Hanoi for more than five years.  Haspel, a 30-year CIA veteran and current acting director of the agency, headed up a clandestine base in Thailand, where she reportedly oversaw the interrogation of a terrorism suspect that included waterboarding. She also reportedly played a part in helping to destroy recorded tapes of the interrogations in 2005. Despite McCain’s comments, his good friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Thursday that he would back Haspel. Graham said she “has rejected the interrogation policies of the past” and “should be confirmed as soon as possible as we live in a time of continuing threats.” At the time of Haspel’s nomination in March, McCain responded by calling the United States’ use of torture against detainees “one of the darkest chapters in American history.” Haspel’s role in the CIA’s torture program has generated bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill. More than 100 retired and former career and non-career U.S. ambassadors sent a letter to the Senate on Wednesday expressing “serious concern” over her nomination. McCain, 81, was diagnosed with brain cancer last July and has been recovering at his Sedona, Arizona, home after undergoing surgery for an intestinal infection last month. He will likely be absent when the Senate votes on Haspel’s confirmation.

Volkswagen Confirms $4.3 Billion U.S. Settlement Over Diesel Scandal,"DETROIT/BERLIN, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG confirmed on Tuesday it has negotiated a $4.3 billion draft settlement with U.S. regulators to resolve its diesel emissions troubles and plans to plead guilty to criminal misconduct. The guilty plea is part of the civil and criminal deal as the automaker looks to restore its tarnished global brand. Volkswagen said with the addition of the fine, its diesel costs will exceed the nearly 18.2 billion euros ($19.2 billion) it has set aside to handle the problem. VW also said it will face oversight by an independent monitor over the next three years. Reuters reported earlier the company’s supervisory board is set to meet on Wednesday to approve a civil and criminal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over the automaker’s diesel emissions. VW said the supervisory board and the management board would meet Tuesday or possibly Wednesday to approve the deal. VW is expected to plead guilty as part of the settlement as early as Wednesday, a source familiar with matter said. The plea deal will need the approval of a U.S. judge. Evercore ISI said in a research note it believes the “settlement is intended to draw a line under all remaining U.S. related legal risk. This is good news.” VW had raced to get a deal done before President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. A change in administration could have delayed a final settlement for months if not longer. “The most important news is that VW managed to come to an agreement that allows the company to move on from here. It’s a major relief that this doesn’t get dragged into the new U.S. administration,” Evercore ISI said. VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide. On Monday, a VW executive, Oliver Schmidt, the second VW employee charged by U.S. prosecutors, was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States over the company’s emissions cheating and the automaker was accused of concealing the cheating from regulators. The Justice Department settlement with VW will not end the Justice Department’s investigation into individual misconduct and more executives may face charges, sources said. VW still must spend the next two years buying back or fixing dirty U.S. vehicles and faces unresolved lawsuits from U.S. investors and about 20 U.S. states. Volkswagen’s expected guilty plea is in contrast to Justice Department deferred prosecution agreements with Toyota Motor Corp and General Motors Co, which were both accused of misleading regulators or consumers and paid fines of $1.2 billion and $900 million, respectively, but were not required to plead guilty. VW warned in a financial disclosure the impact of the U.S. settlement on 2016 group results cannot be quantified yet, citing “various further factors.” VW said in late October it expected the group operating margin to come in at the upper end of a 5 to 6 percent target range before one-off items, compared with 6 percent in 2015. The carmaker is due to announce 2016 results on March 14. Separately, Porsche SE, the main shareholder of VW, issued a profit warning after the VW news. The settlement on U.S. criminal and civil fines will negatively affect Porsche SE’s results for 2016, the company said, adding it is possible the net result may drop below the previously reported range of 1.4-2.4 billion euros. Volkswagen had previously agreed to spend up to $17.5 billion in the United States to resolve claims by U.S. regulators, owners and dealers and offered to buy back nearly 500,000 polluting vehicles. Much of the company’s senior management departed following the scandal, including chief executive Martin Winterkorn. VW Group said on Tuesday it had record sales in 2016 of 10.3 million vehicles, including a 12 percent increase in December. That figure should put VW ahead of Japanese rival Toyota Motor as the world’s largest car producer by volume for the year. On Monday, VW shares rose 4.2 percent to their highest since September 2015 on optimism about the expected U.S. criminal settlement, topping the German blue-chip DAX index. The shares are still 10 percent below pre-scandal levels. VW shares closed up less than 0.2 percent in trading Tuesday in Frankfurt before the company’s announcement.

Cardinals Outfielder Stephen Piscotty Was Hit 3 Times In 1 Trip Around The Bases,"Cardinals’ outfielder Stephen Piscotty exited the game against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night after he was hit by three baseballs in one trip around the bases.  A video posted to Twitter shows the three instances in which Piscotty was hit ― first at bat, then as he ran to second and again when he ran home.  Unbelievable. Stephen Piscotty gets hit 3 times from his at bat to scoring at home. Each elbow and his head. Looks okay. pic.twitter.com/uVRYbfomq4 Piscotty was hit twice in the elbow, but the last hit to the head caused him to exit the game, USA Today reported. He cleared concussion protocol Wednesday, according to ESPN, and was cleared to play, but Wednesday’s game against the Cubs was postponed due to rain. For the makeup game, the Cardinals will host the Cubs in St. Louis on Thursday.  Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Piscotty said of the final blow, “It just stunned me. It wasn’t like I lost consciousness. I was fine.” In 2015, Piscotty was carted off the field after a violent collision in the outfield with teammate Peter Bourjos left the player unconscious.  “The one in Pittsburgh I came out very, very fortunate,” Piscotty said Wednesday, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “That one could have been very serious. I think the fact that I got hit three times [Tuesday] night makes it more dramatic.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
"Hula Painted Frog, Newly Rediscovered Species In Israel, Reclassified Into 'Extinct' Genus","An extremely rare species of frog has been classified into a genus previously known only through fossils, scientists declared this week.   In 1996, the Hula painted frog became the first amphibian officially considered extinct by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Originally discovered in the Hula Valley in 1943, the last confirmed sighting had been in 1955, more than 40 years before scientists finally decided to label the species as extinct. In 2011, a park ranger named Yoram Malka spotted one of the frogs in the Hula Valley Nature Reserve.  Since then, scientists have discovered up to 14 of the frogs, National Geographic reports. The IUCN has already redefined the frog from being “extinct” to “critically endangered” in 2012, but one detail of its classification remains outdated: The Hula painted frog is no longer considered to be a part of the Discoglossus genus.     Sarig Gafny, a scientist at the Ruppin Academic Center in Michmoret, Israel, conducted a study on the rediscovered species, published this week in Nature Communications journal. In addition to the exciting re-emergence of the frogs, new information came to light in Gafny’s study: The frog is not a member of the Discoglossus genus as previously thought, but instead is the last survivor of Latonia, an extinct amphibian genus previously known only through fossils.  ""Imagine that somewhere in north east Asia someone discovered a local species of elephants that was not known to science, and then, two years later, they present strong evidence that this elephant species is actually a mammoth,"" Professor Gafny explained to the Huffington Post in an email. ""I assume that finding a live mammoth would have been a striking piece of news."" Rebecca Biton, a paleontologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and co-author of the study, explained that the researchers decided to reclassify the frog after analyzing DNA and ancient frog bones. ""The Hula painted frog is not what we thought it was,"" Biton told LiveScience. According to Tablet Magazine, the Hula painted frog is indigenous to a location rich with history. Known as Merom in the Hebrew Bible, the location where Joshua supposedly defeated the Canaanites, the Hula Lake and surrounding marshlands were drained in the 1950s due to malarial concerns. Parts of the valley were flooded again and restored to become the Hula Valley Nature Reserve in the 1990s. ""Scientists tend to err on the side of caution before declaring something extinct, so we were pretty sure this frog was gone,"" said Robin Moore, the creative director of Amphibian Survival Alliance. ""[The re-discovery of the Hula Painted Frog is] a real testament to the resilience of nature.”",ENVIRONMENT,SCIENCE
Zoom Into The Mesmerizing Heart Of Our Own Milky Way Galaxy,"Ever wondered what it would be like to travel to the center of the Milky Way? Now you can find out. Sort of. The Hubble Space Telescope stared deep into the heart of our own galaxy to capture a mesmerizing image of its nuclear star cluster. Scientists then used the detailed picture to produce a stunning video (above), which starts with a broad view of the Milky Way and zooms viewers into its center. The nuclear cluster, containing half a million stars, surrounds the galaxy's central ""supermassive black hole,"" according to a statement on Hubble's website.  ""So packed with stars, it is equivalent to having a million suns crammed into the volume of space between us and our closest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light-years away,” the statement adds. It's almost impossible to spot the cluster, located 27,000 light-years away, with the naked eye. Astronomers used infrared vision to ""pierce through"" the galaxy's dust. They then translated the infrared light into colors we can see. The image from which the video was made (below) spans 50 light-years across and was stitched together from 9 separate photographs taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. The larger blue foreground stars are not part of the cluster.  ""The 'snowstorm' of stars in the image is just the tip of the iceberg: Astronomers estimate that about 10 million stars in this cluster are too faint to be captured in this image,"" the statement says.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
What A Dust Devil Looks Like On Mars,"A dust devil has been photographed swirling on Mars. NASA's Opportunity rover captured the astonishing image in the red planet's Meridiani Planum region. The space agency posted the picture on Facebook on Sunday: ""This is one of the best dust devils that we have seen in Meridiani Planum,"" Opportunity's deputy principal investigator Ray Arvidson told Mashable. ""We are lucky to have captured this one in an image!"" According to NASA, dust devils on Mars form the same way they do in deserts on Earth. They are essentially spinning columns of air which appear on clear days after the ground has soaked up heat from the sun. We can see them because of the dust and dirt they suck up. A Martian dust devil that rose more than half a mile high was caught on camera by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed over the red planet's Amazonis Planitia region in 2012. And in 2005, Opportunity's sister explorer Spirit captured this whirlwind sweeping across the Martian terrain: The golf cart-size Opportunity and Spirit rovers landed on Mars in 2004. Both were tasked with searching for signs of past water activity on the planet. After finding such evidence, they just kept on trundling along.  Spirit was declared ""dead"" in 2011 once communications with Earth ceased. But Opportunity is still going strong, as this sensational image confirms.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Uber Is Still Losing Carloads Of Money,"New CEO, same old problem. Uber lost $4.5 billion in 2017 and posted sales of just under $7.5 billion, the ride-hailing company told investors Tuesday. The loss was 61 percent more than the year before, according to data obtained by CNBC. Despite the eye-popping figures, Uber is making headway on slowing the bleeding. Uber, a private company, doesn’t have to publicly disclose earnings. But The Wall Street Journal, which reviewed the company’s figures, reported Uber increased sales by at least 10 percent every quarter in 2017. In the fourth quarter ― the first three-month period under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ― the company increased the total value of all its fares 60 percent from the prior year, to $11.06 billion. Bloomberg notes Uber ended 2017 with about $6 billion in cash on hand, 13 percent less than the year earlier.  Last month, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. acquired a roughly 15-percent stake in the company, giving it a fresh infusion of cash and becoming Uber’s largest shareholder. Khosrowshahi said previously he wants to take the company public by 2019, which means Uber eventually will have to pull back the curtain on details of its financial performance. Complicating matters, the company has been without a chief financial officer since 2015. Uber’s tumultuous 2017 included the exit of former CEO Travis Kalanick, whose tenure was marked by controversies that included sexual harassment and discrimination, and questionable business practices.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
5 Tricks To Make Your Identity Portfolio More Secure,"I’ve written extensively about the importance of building a credit portfolio. Credit equals buying power, which, when used wisely, can lead to increased net worth. Put simply, bad credit means fewer consumer choices and a staggering number of lost opportunities in the way of deals, car-factory incentives and other credit-based transactions. No matter the purchase type, the lowest interest rates and the biggest loans go to those with the strongest credit portfolios. You can read about building your credit portfolio here. Another portfolio is the one most people neglect, if they even know it exists: the identity portfolio. Your identity portfolio is not something you can buy, trade or sell. It’s not as easy to assign a value to it. You can manage it badly and (most likely) not go bankrupt. In most situations, you won’t even lose any money — though you may not be able to get your hands on whatever was stolen by identity thieves for a while. That said, a poorly managed identity portfolio can cost you big time. First of all, the longer your money is tied up (it can take between six months to almost one year to get a stolen tax refund), the longer it will lie dormant. You can’t invest accounts that are still receivable. Second, you lose something that’s hard to quantify — your peace of mind and your ability to get through your day undistracted. In more concrete terms, while the crime committed against you is getting sorted out, your credit will take a hit. You will lose the chance to take advantage of credit-based purchases while you are resolving the fallout from identity theft. (Not sure if you’ve been the target of identity theft? You can check for signs by viewing two of your credit scores for free on Credit.com.) Here are five things you can do to improve your identity portfolio to make sure that doesn’t happen. 1. Adopt Two-Factor Authentication Increasingly, the websites you visit most — the ones that require authentication — will offer two-factor authentication. Whether the process triggers a code being sent to your phone via SMS or it fires off an email with that information, this simple security precaution makes it more difficult for a hacker to take over your accounts. The reason: They need more than the answers to your security questions or your login credentials. Two-factor authentication works because the scammer needs control of your email or access to your SMS messaging, which in most cases requires actual possession of your phone (and the security code to unlock it). 2. Make Your Login/User ID Complex Hackers and scam artists are very good at cracking the virtual safes where you keep your money, and they know how to slip past the gates protecting your social media activity. Many sites still insist on making people use their email addresses as a user ID. While it’s not as quite as risky as a Social Security number or a name/date of birth combination, your email is personally identifiable information (PII). If you are given the choice to make up a user ID, there is no reason it has to be your name. Get creative or treat it like a password (but don’t get so creative that you are tempted to share your clever inventions with friends and strangers via social media). Always assume the bad guys are watching — they are. 3. Answer Security Questions Creatively Security questions are a real problem. After decades of oversharing on social media, your mother’s maiden name, what high school you attended, the make of your first car and your favorite action movie are all up for grabs. Think you’ve been careful? What about your friends? Are you tagged? Mentioned? Even if you don’t have an account, chances are good that the people closest to you — those sharing biographical information with you — are active on social media. To avoid the possibility of a crook guessing his or her way into your life, your answers to security questions should always be lies. As above, let your spirit fly. But don’t be so creative that you can’t remember your lies. If you’re afraid of losing track, create a cheat sheet and store it on an encrypted thumb drive. 4. Store Your PII on an Encrypted Thumb Drive Losing your most essential personally identifiable information is a real drag. I recommend scanning the most crucial documents, as well as your login information if you don’t use a password manager, encrypting that information, and storing it on an air-gapped device, a category that includes the humble thumb drive. Keep one at home and store the other in a safe deposit box or a safe. This is particularly useful when you’re traveling. 5. Choose Built-in Biometric Authentication Speaking of thumb drives, for a reasonable price you can buy one that requires your fingerprint to access the information stored on it. Whether it’s a new smartphone or a gun safe, there are an increasing number of products that offer biometric security features. Remember, as I discuss at length in my book SWIPED, don’t share too much information with folks you don’t know, whether in person, on the phone or online via social media, and never authenticate yourself to anyone unless you are in control of the interaction. Bear in mind, micro-trends on social media (10 concerts I’ve been to, one is a lie; top 10 favorite movies, important books you’ve never read, etc.) are not only a fun way to get to know your friends better. They offer hackers information that can be used to answer security questions. In fact, you never know the origin of these digital stadium waves. It’s wise to assume they were started by identity thieves looking to harvest useable information. So resist the urge to answer them. It’s also critical to set long and strong passwords and properly secure all computers, smartphones and tablets used by you and your family. As mentioned, use two-factor authentication when possible and shred sensitive documents. Too much to remember? The nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) has created a simple set of protocols called SHRED: Strengthen passwords Handle PII with care Read credit reports annually Empty your purse/wallet Discuss these tips with friends I encourage you to do all of the above and make good privacy and security hygiene a part of your daily life. Change the way you think about identity theft and your personally identifiable information. Over time, you will naturally become more vigilant. You will bear in mind what happens when people overshare on social media. You will be careful about who you tell what and why. You will not let down your guard, and before you know it, your identity portfolio will have a triple-A rating.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Neil deGrasse Tyson Has A Sobering Reminder For You This Earth Day,"Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took a moment on Earth Day to remind those calling for the planet’s “saving” to revise their message. The author, podcast host and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History tweeted the advice on Sunday. The perennial cry to “Save Earth"" is odd. Planet Earth survives massive asteroid strikes -- it'll survive anything we throw at it. But Life on Earth will not. His message is a familiar one (for scientists and George Carlin fans alike). But as science communications guru Aaron Huertas put it, “Save the Planet” has a better ring to it than the reality. Admittedly, ""Preserve the Relatively Stable Biosphere in Which Human Civilization Developed"" doesn't quite have the same ring to it. But that’s a start... https://t.co/ZiOUdSHQ4G Soon after, climate scientist Gavin Schmidt offered a solution: A better (and almost as pithy) slogan would be ""Save our Earth"" - the one with the current coastlines, biosphere, atmospheric composition and inhabitants. @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 https://t.co/PyHhMU3HXt",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

You Can Now Watch Thursday Night Football On Amazon Prime,"Amazon has confirmed a deal with the National Football League to give Prime members streaming access to the league’s Thursday Night Football games when the season starts in September.  It’s costing Amazon $50 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, to air the 10 games. Amazon already offers Prime members the ability to add special subscription packages, such as Showtime and Starz, for an additional price, but the new NFL package will be free for subscribers.  “We’re focused on bringing our customers what they want to watch, Prime members want the NFL,” Amazon Senior Vice President Jeff Blackburn told The Wall Street Journal. Amazon beat out bids from Google, Facebook and Twitter to have the exclusive online streaming rights. This isn’t the first time the NFL has tried to move into the world of streaming. Twitter had a similar deal with the league last year for only $10 million dollars, according to a Bloomberg report.    This might be the right move for the NFL if they want to hold on to younger viewers. Cable subscriptions have been dwindling over the last few years as customers move toward cheaper streaming packages and services. About 25 percent of American households now go without any cable or satellite packages, according to a report by market research company GfK.

CBS Reporter Sparks Uproar By Mistakenly Claiming Kaepernick Wouldn't Kneel,"CBS sports reporter Jason La Canfora sparked outrage on Sunday when he falsely reported that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick would stand for the national anthem if signed to a team. Last year Colin Kaepernick, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback, knelt during the national anthem at a game and created a controversy that has yet to blow over. The act of “taking a knee” was originally intended by Kaepernick to silently protest the systematic racial injustices in the United States, but critics claimed that the act was a disrespect of the American flag and military.  Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the season, and has curiously remained an unsigned free agent. Most believe that his controversial protests are the reason that teams refuse to sign the quarterback. La Confora was originally reporting on Kaepernick’s desire to work with NFL teams to get back in the game when he made an erroneous claim about whether or not the quarterback would continue to protest.   ″He’s not planning on kneeling,” La Canfora said on “The NFL Today” on Sunday. “He’s going to donate all his jersey sales and he’s planning on standing for the anthem if given the opportunity, J.B.” After sitting down with Colin Kaepernick for several hours, @JasonLaCanfora says the QB is still actively trying to play in the NFL. pic.twitter.com/R9qTIZ7EQl The Associated Press also reported the claims, based on La Confora’s supposed interview, and spread the news even further. Nessa Diab, Kaepernick’s girlfriend, tweeted a correction to the piece, calling the report completely false.  “The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone,” Diab wrote on Twitter. Fans of the quarterback on social media were deeply angered by the mistake, calling the report a lie. After tremendous Twitter backlash, La Confora issued a clarification to his statements on air. “Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7,” La Confora tweeted. “When I was asked about his [sic] whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem, standing for Anthem wasn’t something that I spoke to Colin about sat. I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future.”  1) Just got a message from @Kaepernick7, who says he has not discussed with anyone his plans in the event he is signed by an NFL team. ESPN did report, using unnamed sources, that Kaepernick would stand in the 2017 season back in March. However, those claims were never confirmed and La Confora supposedly sat with Kaepernick for hours before Sunday’s segment on the quarterback’s future. Kaepernick seemed to respond to the claims using a fake Winston Churchill quote on Twitter. “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on, Winston S. Churchill,” Kapernick tweeted Sunday. It’s unclear whether Kaepernick intended to misquote the former prime minister of the United Kingdom to further his point or whether it was a mistake. A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.Winston S. Churchill",SPORTS,SPORTS
Super Bowl Ads Are a Great Way to Waste Money," A 30-second spot during Super Bowl 51 will cost $5 million. If advertisers are willing to pay that much, many assume a Super Bowl ad is a good investment - especially since viewers pay more attention to them than typical ads. Here are some of the reasons why Super Bowl ads are so popular. They... With all these positives, why do some think that Super Bowl ads are a waste of money? Estimated costs The cost of producing a Super Bowl ad can vary greatly. If celebrities and top directors are used, they can be very expensive. The Chrysler ad with Eminem in 2011 cost $9 million to produce. At the atypical low end, the Doritos Time Machine commercial, which aired in 2014, reportedly cost $200 to make because it was created by an amateur that won a contest. Whatever it costs to produce, a 30-second Super Bowl TV spot in 2017 will set back advertisers an additional $5 million to air on Fox.  While these costs are significant, good business people do not focus on costs. They are more interested in the return that their investment is likely to produce. When you look at the data, Super Bowl ads are typically not very good investments. Effectiveness Don't get me wrong. I personally like to watch many of the same commercials that viewers vote as their favorites. They are funny, sexy, clever and entertaining. The problem is that, for the cost invested, most of them do not generate a significant blip in sales. Why? Even if viewers can recall the product or brand being advertised, very few spots provide sufficient unique benefits to give buyers good reasons to buy. According to a post by Jack Neff in Ad Age, a study shows that 80 percent of Super Bowl ads don't improve sales. Entering the political fray in 2017 In the politically-charged climate since Trump became President, some have already accused Anheuser-Busch of making a political statement in its immigrant ad even though it was planned nearly a year ago to pay tribute to its founder Adolphus Busch - an immigrant from Germany. The ad from Mexican avocado growers is also likely to cause many to think about Trump's stance on trade with our southern neighbor. What if advertisers invested the cost to air one Super Bowl ad in other media? According to Digiday, if you invested $5 million, you could get the following online: If the Super Bowl ads produced the sales or bona fide brand impressions you want, the above data would be irrelevant. The fact that 80 percent of them don't means that marketers could find better places to invest their advertising dollars. Great opportunity wasted It is true that the Super Bowl affords advertisers the opportunity to reach a huge audience at a time when audiences are fragmented over too many different media. The tragedy is that too many viewers do not remember very much about the brands or products advertised. While many say they like the commercials in the moment, they do not remember the products for very long afterwards, and they certainly do not buy them as a result. If it doesn't sell, it is not creative Rather than exploit this opportunity, too many ""blow it"" by focusing on the entertainment value of the commercials and neglecting what should be the main focus - selling the product, the stock and everything else the company has to sell. They tend to forget that the most important part of the AIDA model (Attention, Interest, Decision, Action) is the second A - not the first. If a commercial is good at getting attention and entertaining the audience, why not take the further step of planting the right message in the brains of viewers to get them to take buying actions? In his book Ogilvy on Advertising, David Ogilvy quotes another agency that claimed, ""if it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."" Too bad David Ogilvy, Rosser Reeves, Bill Bernbach and Shirley Polykoff are still not with us. If they were, Super Bowl commercials would not only be entertaining, they would also greatly increase sales.  Let's hope some of the commercials this year prove me, and other naysayers, wrong. Somehow, I don't think they will. Hope you enjoy the game, and the commercials.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
"Cambridge Analytica Being Investigated By Justice Department, FBI: Report","The FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct data firm involved in a massive data breach in March, The New York Times reported Tuesday. News of the investigation comes roughly two months after the London-based company was accused of secretly harvesting the personal data of at least 87 million Facebook users to better identify individuals that could be targeted and influenced by specific marketing material.  Federal investigators have reportedly questioned potential witnesses, including former employees and banks that conducted business with the company, a U.S. official and other people familiar with the probe told the Times.  The DOJ declined to comment, while the FBI did not immediately respond to a query. The United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency is conducting its own investigation into whether the firm violated the country’s Data Protection Act, the Times reported. The agency is looking into allegations that Cambridge Analytica employees may have sought to bribe foreign officials, tampered with evidence and hacked computers. Cambridge Analytica announced earlier in May that it planned to close all of its operations and file for bankruptcy in the United States, reportedly as a result of rising legal fees and a loss of clients after it was outed for harvesting Facebook users’ data. In a statement on its website, the firm said it has been the subject of “numerous unfounded accusations” and “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.” Shortly after news of the breach surfaced, the firm announced an independent investigation into its practices. The results of that investigation, which were shared on the company’s website, stated that the allegations against the firm were not “borne out by the facts. When asked for comment on the DOJ investigation, a Cambridge Analytica press representative sent HuffPost a copy of the company’s internal probe. Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign hired Cambridge Analytica but the company has denied that it used data acquired through Facebook to assist Trump’s efforts to win the election. Secret recordings of Cambridge Analytica executives appeared to capture them bragging about helping elect Trump by using “unattributable and untraceable” advertising and attack ads, according to an undercover report by British news station Channel 4. Facebook first learned in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica was harvesting users’ data but failed to follow up after the firm allegedly promised to delete the information, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said in April. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has since apologized for not doing more to protect users’ data and vowed to increase privacy and security standards. Zuckerberg also testified before Senate and House committees to answer questions about Facebook users’ data protections.",POLITICS,TECH
Hawaii Stores Selling Dead Baby Sharks As Souvenirs,"Hawaii News Now - KGMB and KHNL When the environmental group Ocean Defender found out a gift shop in Hawaii was selling dead baby sharks as souvenirs, it made it its mission to stop the ""disturbing"" practice.  Nani Aloha Street Store in Waikiki had been marketing the preserved sharks to tourists using ancient Hawaiian mythology. A short description underneath the jars read, in part, ""In Hawaiian mythology, the shark is believed to be an 'Aumakua, or ancestral guardian who watches over and protects a person and their family.""  ""I was horrified,"" Ocean Defender's founder, Oriana Kalama, told Hawaii News Now, ""and I was infuriated at the fact that they had used our cultural traditions, they had used our aumakua, as a way to make more money.""  (The baby sharks in the Waikiki store appear to be Atlantic Sharpnose sharks, which are not endangered and not native to Hawaiian waters. It is not clear if the store was violating state laws that prohibit possession of shark fins.)  Kalama posted an article on Ocean Defender's website calling for public complaints and boycotts, and within days, the outrage had picked up such momentum that the store capitulated. The store's website now features a letter apologizing to customers and noting that they have stopped selling ""the product of issue.""  But the war isn't over for Ocean Defender. Several Facebook commenters noted that they'd seen the same jars sold in other parts of Hawaii, in California, and on EBay. Kalama is now looking to go after the manufacturers.  ""We are very very confident that we will stop this sale of bottled baby sharks very soon,"" Ocean Defender's Facebook page said. ""It is completely unnecessary and promotes thoughtlessness and arrogance and stupidity.""

Watch One Of The World's Largest Lakes Shrink Before Your Eyes,"The Aral Sea used to be the world’s fourth-largest lake, but it has been reduced to two relative puddles. NASA shared a time-lapse video on Thursday that shows the original Aral Sea shrinking, starting in the year 2000. It has become two separate, much smaller bodies of water: the North and South Aral Seas.  The lake has suffered since the 1960s, when the Soviet Union diverted two major rivers that supported the lake — the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya — to irrigate agricultural fields in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The aftermath, as described by NASA, was nothing short of devastating:  As the Aral Sea has dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. In July, Al-Jazeera reported on a small bright spot in the efforts to restore the North Aral Sea. The 2005 Kokaral dam construction project, financed by the World Bank, had led to 15 kinds of fish returning to the waters. A second phase of the dam project is slated to keep restoring the North Aral. ",SCIENCE,ENVIRONMENT

Trump Administration To Divide Immigrant Families To Prosecute Parents For Illegal Entry,"In a sweeping enforcement change, Donald Trump’s administration will increasingly prosecute members of immigrant families who cross the border illegally, even if that means splitting children from their parents and regardless of whether they’re seeking safety in the U.S., Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday. It’s already happening. On April 27, Border Patrol officers picked up a 30-year-old Salvadoran woman, Morena Mendoza Romaldo, with one of her children after she crossed into the U.S. near San Diego. She fled El Salvador because of sexual violence, according to court filings. She clearly told Border Patrol that she was afraid to return there; an arrest narrative filed in court has “credible fear claim” written on it.  Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. But previously the Justice Department rarely targeted family units — as the Border Patrol describes parents who cross with their children — for prosecution. Instead, authorities typically routed migrant families to immigration courts, and they were often released from detention after three weeks because of a court order limiting how long undocumented children may remain locked up. People with credible fear of being returned to their native countries were likewise often sent to immigration court instead of being criminally prosecuted. But now, with the Trump administration looking for ways to crack down on policies its officials deride as “catch and release,” the response has gotten harsher.  Mendoza’s case was one of 11 immigration prosecutions filed against alleged members of a caravan of asylum-seeking Central Americans. At least two others were also separated from their children after facing prosecution for illegal entry.  Sessions and Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting Director Thomas Homan said during a press conference in San Diego that the Department of Homeland Security would refer for prosecution all cases of people crossing illegally, as part of a zero-tolerance policy — regardless of whether they’re fleeing persecution or traveling with children.  “People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border,” Sessions insisted. He later said, “We don’t want to separate families, but we don’t want families to come to the border illegally.” It will be up to individual U.S. attorneys to decide how many of the migrants will face criminal charges. In the past, limits on the number of government attorneys or courtroom capacity led authorities to instead route most people caught at the border through the traditional deportation process without convicting them of a crime first. Last week Sessions announced that the Justice Department hired 35 more assistant U.S. attorneys to help prosecute immigration crimes in the five federal districts that touch the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration prosecutions have taken up roughly half the federal criminal docket since 2008, after policy changes pioneered by George W. Bush, institutionalized under Barack Obama and now enthusiastically embraced by Trump. The zero-tolerance policy won’t apply to those who seek asylum at ports of entry, which is not illegal, although the Trump administration has publicly urged migrants to stay in Mexico instead. At least two of the 11 alleged caravan members facing prosecution for illegal entry — Olga Esmeralda George and Marbel Yaneth Ramirez-Raudales — said they tried to initiate asylum claims at a nearby port of entry but were turned away, according to court filings.  Sessions’ plans are already facing opposition from the San Diego Federal Public Defenders’ Office. Illegal entry prosecutions are often open and shut cases. But attorney Eric Fish has asked the court to dismiss three of the 11 alleged caravan members’ cases, arguing that his clients, including Mendoza, were targeted for political reasons that amount to unconstitutional discrimination. In court filings littered with Trump’s tweets excoriating the caravan, Fish contended that Border Patrol agents arrested the three defendants at the same time as a group of Indian nationals. But the Indians were never prosecuted.   “The government cannot choose its defendants based on their alleged country of citizenship, but that’s exactly what it did here,” he wrote in a court filing. “The Court should not stand for such invidious discrimination, and should dismiss the complaint.” Fish is also disputing the $10,000 bonds set by the court, arguing that his clients present no flight risk and could be instead monitored by GPS and released on their own recognizance.  The cases highlight how much energy Sessions is devoting to some of the pettiest crimes possible. Until he announced his zero-tolerance policy, illegal-entry prosecutions were all but unheard of in San Diego. And in the three contested cases, the government offered to free the defendants on time served if they pleaded guilty.  At least two of the defendants said they intend to seek asylum, which generally exempts people from criminal prosecution for illegally crossing the border. One of them, Yaneth, attempted to turn herself in at a legal port of entry but was turned away, according to court filings. Under U.S. law and international treaty obligations, Customs and Border Protection is required to let in migrants who say they fear persecution in their country of origin. But CBP faces a lawsuit in the Southern District of California alleging that the agency often flouts those rules.  Organizers with the caravan disputed that the migrants facing prosecution were affiliated with their group, though they said it’s possible that some had joined the caravan and later left it. At its peak, the number of migrants traveling with the caravan topped 1,000, but its numbers dwindled to fewer than 300 as some decided to remain in Mexico, were counseled that their asylum claims would be hard to press in U.S. courts or were repelled by the open hostility of top Trump administration officials.  “It’s pretty obvious that they don’t know who is part of the caravan or not,” said Alex Mensing — an organizer with Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which coordinated the caravan — noting that one of the defendants, Eric Alberto López Robles, is a Mexican national and that the caravan did not work with any Mexican adults. “It just doesn’t add up.”  Those crossing with the caravan were instructed to go through a legal port of entry to make their claims and were advised against crossing illegally, according to Nicole Ramos, the director of Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit group that is offering legal services to the caravan’s members. Ramos, who once worked as a federal public defender, said that in legal workshops, she warned about the threat of prosecution.  “After people were given transit visas, perhaps some of them went in other directions, but they were not integrated into the caravan,” she said. “The goal of the caravan was to get to Tijuana and present themselves legally. And as part of the legal orientation we gave, we specifically advised people about criminal prosecutions.” Prosecuting people who are seeking asylum could violate international law, according to human rights advocates. Border Patrol was warned about this at least once, when the DHS Office of the Inspector General issued a report in 2015 saying the agency risked violating U.S. treaties by referring people for prosecution even though they expressed fear of persecution in their native country.  Immigrant rights advocates have been hearing for months from parents who were separated from their children and in some cases aren’t sure how to get in touch with them. The practice “is simply barbaric,” said Eleanor Acer, who leads the refugee protection program at Human Rights First. “If other countries treated people seeking refugee protection in this way,” she said, “the United States would be appalled.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
Delta Air Lines…Did We Not Learn Anything From The United Debacle?,"As an Atlanta resident, I LOVE Delta Airlines. As a corporate trainer however, I cringe at some of their recent leadership missteps. Several weeks ago, they received tons of negative press over a nightmarish spring break travel season fraught with extensive customer delays, thousands of flight cancellations and arguably poor management decisions. As a corporate trainer who advises leaders and teams on a wide range of issues and also one of those unlucky Delta spring break passengers, I felt moved to write an article “I’m Sorry….the Two Tragically Forgotten Words in Customer Service”. The article essentially asserts that to avoid apologizing when a company has clearly dropped the ball, only makes the situation worse. Unfortunately, the article seemed to foreshadow even darker days for the airline industry. Just a few days later, I watched in horror as the United Airlines video surfaced showing a seemingly harmless paying customer being dragged off a flight in order to make room for United flight crew in accordance with their (controversial at best) “policy”. Instead of issuing an immediate apology, top executives’ initial statements seemed to blame the customer and show complete support for United crew who were simply “following policy” according to executives. Hearing the executives’ misguided, defensive response, I tweeted out my article with #United Airlines….”United Executives, please read…” because I felt it was so relevant to their current situation. Arguably, the worldwide media firestorm about the United debacle diverted the attention from Delta’s missteps. My prayer was that Delta would take advantage of the “reprieve” and take copious notes on what not to do as they watched the United drama unfold. Boy, was I wrong! This morning, my jaw dropped to the floor as I watched video of what appeared to be a typical easy going Delta customer being kicked off a plane – not because he made terroristic threats, not because he was violent or belligerent with another passenger or crew member, not because he was intoxicated and causing a disturbance….no, because he decided that he couldn’t hold it anymore during the tarmac delay and decided to quickly run to the restroom (even though he’d asked permission 30 minutes earlier and been denied). Their justification for turning the plane around and forcing everyone to disembark? He did not comply with crew instructions. In ABC News’ recount of the incident, fellow passenger attorney Krista Rosolino (who recorded the video) described the incident as “the most outrageous treatment of a paying customer I’ve ever seen.” She further described her outrage in an open letter to Delta Airlines. As a huge believer in learning from other’s mistakes, I’d like to share three key principles Delta should have learned from the United fiasco: Apply the Common Sense Filter to All Policies It’s amazing to me that these executives in their formal responses cling to their own internal policies absolutely seemingly with little focus on critical analysis of the specific situation. Just as I’m sure virtually everyone would agree that policies are absolutely necessary and expecting passengers to follow crew member instructions is completely reasonable (if not necessary), but virtually any policy must be considered in context (and there are almost always exceptions). In this situation, I can’t help but ask what ifs…..What if a young pregnant woman had asked to use the restroom? What if an elderly person with a medical condition or a young child needed to use the restroom? It’s hard to imagine that those situations would not have (and should not have) played out differently. Certainly there have also been rare instances of crew members being impaired or otherwise making very poor choices (e.g. the American Airlines crew member who just days ago reportedly became quite aggressive with a mother holding a baby). Assuming crew aren’t perfect, there’s always the possibility that they could give an instruction that could jeopardize safety – should those be blindly adhered to as well? Blind allegiance to policy at the expense of basic common sense is a recipe for disaster. Don’t Overreact in a Conflict Situation The United example seems to provide a lesson on the dangers of overreacting in a conflict situation. Instead of deescalating when possible, it seemed that the focus was escalation if not domination and clearly the situation spiraled out of control. The lesson here – accept that there will be policy violations – expect them as a part of doing business and seek the path of de-escalation whenever possible. Always Consider the Worst Case Scenario One technique for avoiding the temptation to overreact is to first think through the worst case result (e.g. the recent United Airlines disaster where the customer was dragged down the aisle). I can’t imagine the backlash that Delta will receive having a video circulating that recounts them not just humiliating this one passenger but also choosing to seriously inconvenience the entire plane full of passengers unnecessarily by making everyone disembark and reboard so they could flex their authority and “force him off the plane”. I just can’t understand how they didn’t weigh the public relations risk either at the flight attendant level (making the initial decision), managerial level (deciding to turn the plane around) or the executive level (issuing a statement blindly citing policy with no apology in sight). Like any other major corporation, Delta can’t control all its employees actions, but their doubling down on this ridiculous series of decisions makes them appear tone deaf at best (and that’s generous). I can’t help but think that if SNL does a skit showing crew members passing out Depend undergarments as they board, they only have themselves to blame.

The Underbelly of Rodeos: Busting the American Myth,"These days YouTube seems to be doing the job of investigative journalism and law enforcement, hopefully in a helpful way. There really is nowhere left to hide and nowhere can it be said to be more useful than in exposing heinous acts of animal cruelty.  Groups like Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK) have used social media to such a great degree that it is hard to refute egregious acts of animal exploitation and abuse. As the 2013 rodeo season gets well under way, we can expect to see yet more evidence that the animals suffer enormously for the jeering crowds.  In 2011 and again in 2012, SHARK's video of horses being given electric shocks to force them to buck at the Reno Rodeo tore across the national media and suddenly, the great American myth of the traditional rodeo where old fashioned cowboys show off their skills, came to a crashing halt. Like many large rodeos, Reno Rodeo is a huge money making event for everyone concerned. It is estimated to bring in around $42 million to the local economy, and that in itself is likely to bring out the worst in people. Power may corrupt, but the love of money sure competes for first place when it comes to people acting the lowest of the low and turning a blind eye to animal abuse in particular. At this year's Reno Rodeo, officials chose to ban all video cameras in what can only be an attempt to curtail any more images of abuses reaching the general public. A general public who are increasingly showing themselves less likely to support blood for sport. Now I have to say, I have come into contact with rodeo people who do hold their animals in the highest regard and have even reached out to animal welfare organizations to help clean up rodeos, so there are good people out there. But what essentially SHARK has revealed, is a huge underbelly of rodeo stock contractors and riders, who will do everything they can to win that prize money. And there's a lot of it at stake.  In Reno, the Xtreme Bulls event alone offers $50,000 in prize money. Both Reno and Cheyenne rodeos have an estimated $1million in total of cash and prizes to be had.  Some of the largest and most controversial rodeos are yet to come. Rodeos like the Calgary Stampede, Cheyenne Frontier Days and Pendleton Round-Up have all come under fire for animal abuse.  At the Calgary Stampede in July 2012, three horses were killed and another was seriously injured during the chuckwagon race. According to Reuters, fifty horses have died in chuckwagon races at Calgary since 1986.  On the first day alone at the 2012 Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo, five animals were so badly injured they had to be taken out of the arena. Another poor steer's leg was broken in the steer-tripping contest, and that I'm sure was the end of him! In 2007 at the Pendleton Round-Up a calf had it's neck broken in the steer-busting event and that is just the tip of the iceberg as injured animals seem to pile up after each rodeo and then quietly dispatched to slaughter or euthanized immediately.  Events such as the Wild Horse Race held at rodeos like Cheyenne must come under more scrutiny for the treatment of the horses. Talk about watching a train wreck waiting to happen, just looking at the footage makes one shudder.  As far as the future for the horses and cattle concerned, well they are two a penny these days so very easily replaced. There is no heavenly retirement pasture for horses and cows that have endured the rodeo circuit; there is only the slaughterhouse if they make it that far. There are also unfortunately, no reliable statistics on the injured animals or what happens to them. I highly doubt any get the expensive treatment commonly associated with veterinary treatment and I cannot see a stock contractor paying for the treatment of an injured calf, can you?  There are other problems too in the rodeo world even where the women only events like the Barrel Racing are concerned. The Women's Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) has recently had to wrestle with an endemic problem of performance enhancing drugs being used on horses. They have recently reinstated a long awaited random drug testing policy to tackle this alarming problem. Drugs like Phenylbutazone (Bute) and Lasix, were apparently being used to mask injury and others were used to enhance performance.  In years gone past one would never have thought that countries like Spain and Mexico would start to ban their very ingrained ""tradition"" of bullfights but they are.  Although some towns in the US like San Francisco do have bans in place against rodeos there are other moves underfoot to ban certain rodeo events. Oregon has introduced a bill that would ban horse tripping at rodeos although the bill has been effectively gutted by the addition of a ""right to rodeo"" clause and with language saying it bans ""intentional"" tripping.  I'm not sure what ""intentional"" tripping is. If you are lassoing a horse with a rope around the legs that is intentional, and if the purpose is to pull the horse over then you have intentionally tripped it. It is nothing short of ridiculous to try and obfuscate language to assuage rodeo people when clearly this is very dangerous for the animal.  On June 3, 2013 the Nevada governor approved a bill to ban horse tripping at rodeos and other entertainment events.  According to the Legislature's online comment system, the Nevada bill was the most popular and had more comments than any other bill introduced. At the Riverdale Rodeo in California the Barnyard Scramble event was cancelled after local authorities received hundreds of complaints from citizens who had seen another SHARK video, the very disturbing footage of children madly trampling small animals for ""fun."" Apparently, the rodeo association and the local SPCA had not realized that offering live animals in competition was a misdemeanor and so, rapped on the wrists by law enforcement, obliged in canceling the event. Animal rescue groups like the Red Barn Rabbit Rescue and Gentle Blessings Animal Rescue, who have taken in numerous animals terribly injured at these events, may find some relief in that decision. It might be difficult for some Neanderthal brains to understand but I believe animals do have at least the most basic of rights. The right not to be transported on double-decker trailers that cause immense stress and injuries, the right not to be drugged, electrocuted, tripped, dragged by ropes, injured and killed for entertainment. The rodeos these days remind me of the gladiator arenas of old where captives were forced to fight to the death to the laughing cheers of the crowd. Healthy sporting competition is one thing, rodeo is most certainly another. Just like Cirque du Soleil out performs animal based circuses so can rodeos switch to more enlightened forms of entertainment that does not include death and mayhem.",ENVIRONMENT,SPORTS
Put ESPN In Charge Of America’s Wars,"The NFL draft is back on ESPN with blanket (read: suffocating) coverage, which always makes me think: What if Americans cared about their wars as much as they cared about the NFL? What if decisions were fact-based and results-oriented? What if everyone was well-informed, highly motivated, and committed to excellence? What if the media provided honest, often outspoken, and comprehensive commentary about our wars, coverage that lasted for months and months, featuring clear-eyed metrics based on relentless analysis? I know ― dream on. If you’re not familiar with NFL football or ESPN coverage of the same, you should be, because it says much about the American moment. The first round of the draft kicks off on Thursday night in prime time, followed by the second and third rounds on Friday night in prime time. The draft concludes on Saturday with rounds four through seven, roughly 250 total picks. Yet this quick summary vastly understates the coverage devoted to the draft. From the end of the Super Bowl early in February to the draft itself at the end of April, coverage of the draft on ESPN is virtually non-stop, with innumerable “mock” drafts for each team and a parade of “experts” speculating about the prospects of each player and team. Exhaustive (and exhausting) is the word to describe this coverage. When Round One finally kicks off, it’s essentially a parade of soon-to-be millionaires. These players, selected from various college football teams, can count on multi-year contracts and signing bonuses in the millions of dollars. ESPN and the NFL stage-manages the selection process, turning it into an extravaganza complete with musicians, cheering (or booing) fans, and plenty of past NFL greats, along with the draftees and their families and friends. Coverage includes shots of the “war rooms” of the various NFL teams as they decide which players to pick, which draft picks to trade, and so on. The war room — isn’t that a telling phrase? Indeed, let’s push that further. Most red-blooded NFL fans would be hard-pressed to find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map, but they can tell you about their team’s draft picks, rattling off statistics such as times in the 40-yard dash, vertical leap, even the size of a player’s hands (considered especially pertinent if he’s a quarterback or wide receiver). What astonishes me is the sheer wealth of detail gathered about each player, the human intelligence (or HUMINT in military terms). Players, especially those projected to go in the first few rounds, are scrutinized from every angle: physical, mental, emotional, you name it. With millions of dollars at stake, such an exhaustive approach is not terribly surprising. Yet even with a wealth of data, each year there are major draft busts (e.g. Ryan Leaf, a quarterback selected #2 overall in the first round and a flop) and major surprises (e.g. Tom Brady, a quarterback selected late in the 6th round as the 199th pick, meaning not much was expected from him, after which he won five Super Bowls). Results from the NFL draft should teach us something about the limits of data-driven “intelligence” in wars, yet our nation’s intelligence agencies (17 of them!) continue to believe they can quantify, predict, and control events in places we and they know little about. But again what wows me is the thoroughness as well as the slickness of ESPN’s coverage of the draft. When a player is selected, ESPN instantly has video of his college highlights, together with his vital statistics (height, weight, performance at the draft combine in various drills, and so on). Video and stats are backed by interviews with a draftee’s previous coaches, who extol his virtues, along with interviews with those “war rooms” again as to why they decided to draft that player and not another. Once the draft is completed, teams are then awarded “grades” by various commentators, even though these players have yet to play a snap in the NFL. (Imagine if your kid received an instant grade in college — before he attended a single class or completed a single assignment — based upon his performance in high school.) You have to hand it to ESPN: their coverage of the draft is an exercise in total information awareness. It’s blanket coverage, an exercise in full-spectrum dominance. It’s slick, professional, and driven by a tireless pursuit of victory by each team (and a relentless pursuit of ratings by ESPN). So, a modest proposal: To win the war on terror, let’s put ESPN in charge of it. I know: It’s a frivolous suggestion to treat war like a sport. But is it? After all, America currently treats the NFL draft with all the seriousness of a life-and-death struggle, even as it treats its wars with comparative frivolity. Small wonder America continues to lose its wars while fielding some winning NFL teams. William J.

More Findings Of CTE In The NFL,"“Look football is great but I ain’t dying for this s―t. Lol”  That’s a tweet by the National Football League’s (NFL) Marcellus Bennett, the Green Bay Packers tight end. He was reacting to comments made the day after an NFL press conference held in July, in which New York Jets rookie Jamal Adams claimed he loves the game so much that if he had “a perfect place to die” it would be on the football field. Thus, an already controversial topic, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among professional football players, became even more contentious. CTE is a condition characterized by brain degeneration and is associated with repeated head trauma. (Encephalopathy is a general term meaning disorder or disease of the brain.) It has led to behavioral and health problems, as well as death, among a number of players in the NFL. Subsequent lawsuits by players have resulted in what are expected to be millions of dollars in payouts by the NFL. The current controversy began with the release of findings from a new study on the topic. A two-page spread in the front section of The New York Times only emphasized the drama. It featured a headshot of each deceased NFL player diagnosed with CTE and images of their brains following an autopsy. The study was originally published on Tuesday, July 25 in The Journal of the American Medical Association. It found that among 202 deceased former football players, whose median age at death was 66 years old, CTE was diagnosed in 177. Most publicized was the deaths of those who were NFL players; it was determined that 110 of 111 of those players, or 99 percent, had various levels of CTE. It should be noted that the NFL players’ brains that were studied were not randomly selected. They were donated by families of those players who probably suffered from symptoms, indicating researchers were more likely to discover they had CTE. The study was conducted by Dr. Ann McKee, a neurobiologist at the Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center. McKee has previously admitted there’s no way to truly know the prevalence of CTE without a means of testing living players. At this stage, determining CTE can only be done posthumously. Media and public perception sometimes fail to give significant attention to the limits of these studies. This study duplicates others that have been done by McKee and her team of researchers at Boston University. They state in this paper, “Estimates of prevalence cannot be concluded or implied from this sample.” Therefore, despite what the public might conclude about the widespread nature of CTE, the study does not determine the number of players in the general NFL population who likely have the disease. In addition, CTE is prevalent in more than just the NFL. In addition to football players, others with evidence of CTE include hockey players, soccer players and soldiers or others exposed to bombings. And even among athletes, CTE is not limited to professionals. It has been found in those who played college and even high school football. What is CTE? In addition to being controversial, CTE is a complex topic. It’s no wonder, considering the key functionality and remarkably intricate structure of the brain. CTE, a progressive degenerative brain disease, is often found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. That trauma can be both symptomatic concussions, as well as subconcussive (asymptomatic) hits to the head. CTE was first recognized in boxers as far back as the 1920s and termed dementia pugilistica. From that derived the term punch drunk. A feature of CTE is that it is triggered by the build-up of tau, naturally-occurring proteins that have become defective, and can be seen as tangles or bundles. This tau build-up leads to brain cell death, a similar phenomenon to Alzheimer’s disease. Uncommonly, but still a feature of CTE, are deposits of beta-amyloid, also a protein and characteristic of Alzheimer’s. Thus, there is evidence of a link between moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries to a higher risk of developing other brain conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Symptoms of CTE include: Aggression Confusion Depression or apathy Impulse control issues Memory loss Movement problems (e.g., tremors and stiffness) Personality changes Progressive dementia Substance abuse Suicidal tendencies The Prognosis Despite increasing evidence clearly linking CTE to head trauma, there is much unknown about the disease. One thing is certain though: there is currently no cure for it. While CTE is most likely to develop following numerous traumatic brain injuries (even without loss of consciousness), and/or a smaller number of severe traumatic brain injuries, there is no evidence that one concussion increases the risk of developing CTE. And even among those with a history of multiple concussions, not every one of them will eventually develop CTE. It appears that regardless of the current findings and the questions surrounding CTE, some NFL players are not waiting to find out what could be in their future. According to NFL reporter Adam Schefter of ESPN, 14 players age 30 or younger have already retired from the NFL during the 2017 preseason. Twenty players retired at the same age during the 2016 season. Increasingly, the stated reason for “hanging up the helmet” is the fear of CTE.",SPORTS,SPORTS
"Elon Musk Says He's Sold 10,000 Flamethrowers Through His Boring Co. Website","Entrepreneur Elon Musk has captured the world’s imagination with his electric cars, space rockets and renewable energy systems, and now the billionaire is looking to corner the market in a slightly less benevolent area: flamethrowers. Musk, the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has recently made headlines with the launch of his company’s Falcon 9 rocket late last year and the impending launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket in February. But besides sending spacecraft into the sky, preparing for the release of the Tesla Semi electric truck and all the other things a genius billionaire businessman does in his day-to-day life, Musk has also launched an actual functional flamethrower for consumers, and he claims he has already sold 10,000 of the $500 weapons. The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party! https://t.co/n2FiZimJia The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false One of Musk’s newest endeavor is The Boring Co., which aims to quickly dig tunnels while “dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more,” according to its website. Tunnels might sound, well, boring, but the company is linked to Musk’s vision for a rapid-transit Hyperloop system that would use tunnels. So far, however, The Boring Co. hasn’t been digging as much as it’s been joking. In late 2017, Musk started selling branded caps through the company’s website, raising $1 million from the sale of 50,000 hats. At the time, he made what was thought to be a joke; now it appears to be very real. After 50k hats, we will start selling The Boring Company flamethrower I know it’s a little off-brand, but kids love it And so it has come to pass. Over the weekend, Musk tweeted about the flamethrower several times, including posting an Instagram video of himself using the gun to produce a flame about 2 feet long. The short flame length keeps it from meeting the federal definition of an illegal flamethrower, Musk claimed. “ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife,” he tweeted. In response to a question posed to them online, the Australian Federal Police advised potential buyers to “check with your local police for local laws.”  A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jan 27, 2018 at 5:29pm PST But it’s nothing but enthusiasm on the Boring Co. site: “World’s safest flamethrower!” the product description reads. “Before shipping, aspiring flamethrower aficionados will be sent a terms and conditions rhyme for review and acceptance. Starts shipping in spring.” In more tongue-in-cheek descriptions, the company advises the flamethrower “may not be used on Boring Company decorative lacquered hay bales or Boring Company dockside munitions warehouses” and “fire extinguisher sold separately (for exorbitant amounts of money).” A $30 “overpriced” fire extinguisher is also available on the website. After tweeting about hitting the 10,000 flamethrower sales mark, Musk added that only 3,000 of its fire extinguishers had been ordered. “You can definitely buy one for less elsewhere, but this one comes with a cool sticker,” the website said. A Californian lawmaker isn’t amused, though. He’s criticized Musk’s incendiary new product and has vowed to push for it to be made illegal in the state.  If this is real, I’m outraged and you should be too. If this is a joke, then it’s a terribly insensitive one given that we’re coming off of the worst wildfire season in history. Either way: NOT FUNNY. NOT GONNA HAPPEN. https://t.co/DCC2xyVsn4 California Assemblyman Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) cited law enforcement and public safety issues. “We don’t allow people to walk in off the street and purchase military-grade tanks or armor-piercing ammunition. I cannot even begin to image the problems a flamethrower would cause firefighters and police officers alike,” he said in a statement tweeted by a Los Angeles Times reporter Monday.",TECH,TECH
Vegas Golden Knights Retire Jersey No. 58 To Honor Victims Of Last Year's Mass Shooting,"The Vegas Golden Knights, the city’s National Hockey League team, honored the 58 victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting before the start of their home game Saturday. A banner hung from the rafters at T-Mobile Arena with the 58 names of those killed nearly six months earlier at a country music festival in Las Vegas when 64-year-old gunman Stephen Paddock fired hundreds of rounds into the crowd from his hotel room. “Tonight, we fly 58 stars in the sky as a reminder that the 58 will always be with us,” the arena’s announcer told the crowd. The team also retired jersey No. 58 as a tribute to the slain individuals. Before the players took to the ice, the victims’ names and the phrase “VEGAS STRONG” were projected onto the rink. “The 58 will always be with us,” the team’s official Twitter account tweeted.

Hurricane Harvey And The Failure Of The Free Market,"Two days ago, libertarian-leaning Forbes blogger Tim Worstall published a post titled “Hurricane Harvey Is When We Need Price Gouging, Not Laws Against It.” I would link to the story, but Forbes seems to have pulled it after the post received tremendous blowback from people who were outraged by Worstall’s pro-price-gauging post. Luckily, because mistakes live forever on the internet, you can read a cache of the article. Worstall explains why he thinks businesses should be able to raise prices on goods and services when disaster strikes. He suggests that when prices go up during a disaster, the people who need the goods and services the most will get them because they’ll be most willing to pay the inflated prices. And the high prices will encourage others to deliver goods and services to the region in the most efficient manner possible, so they can get a cut of those giant profits. He writes: So these images of a Houston Best Buy selling water for exorbitant sums of money is the kind of “efficient” solution Worstall believes the market provides during a disaster: So a @BestBuy in Houston is price gouging water during this rescue. Holy crap, BB, what is WRONG with you? pic.twitter.com/R0spS04wFw What Worstall doesn’t address, though, is what happens when someone simply can’t afford that high price of bottled water? An economics wonk who blogs at the Big Picture under the name Invictus asked Worstall just that question on Twitter: An infant's life is at risk due to gouging on what is usually affordable formula and/or medicine. Should the infant die, Tim? Yes or no. https://t.co/jYa86qmuye Invictus repeatedly asked Worstall the question, and Worstall struggled mightily to parse his way out of it. At one point, he claimed that “We’re not arguing about whether supplies should be provided. We’re arguing about how.” Finally, the Forbes blogger refused to respond: I'm old enough to recognise questions of the have you stopped beating your wife kind. Not playing. In other words, Worstall prefers his arguments to remain academic. This is how libertarians and trickle-downers like their economics: without any real-world consequences. If they keep the situation broadly rhetorical and they refuse to address the real-world consequences of their policies, they can continue to ‘win’ arguments using trickery and pedantry. But here’s the thing: People on the ground in Houston are right now living in the academic thought experiment that Worstall and others are bloviating on about. Prices are being gouged on food and water and gas and hotels. And not everyone can afford those prices. What would Worstall have hungry and thirsty poor people do? He refuses to say. So let’s consider the real-world options that people are left with in Houston right now: These are the options. This is a life-or-death situation, and the free market simply can’t provide solutions for everyone. (As I’ve argued in the past, the free market doesn’t care if you live or die.) But trickle-down pundits like Tim Worstall have devoted their lives to arguing that the free market is a godlike, omniscient force that always provides the best outcomes. So rather than revise their arguments, or acknowledge that sometimes the free market fails, they simply plug their fingers in their ears and ignore the suffering of their fellow human beings. Even in cases like this — when tens of thousands of Americans are rising to the occasion and helping their fellow citizens because they know it is the right thing to do — zealots like Worstall simply can’t refute the profit motive. And yet they also refuse to accept the inhumanity of their own arguments. So they have to do what hundreds of thousands of Texans are doing right now: they hunker down in the dark and wait for the storm to pass.

Dollar General To Create 400 New Jobs In Texas As It Expands In Rural America,"Dollar General, a favorite spot for household staples across the country, is expanding even further.  The company announced plans Wednesday to build a new distribution center in Longview, Texas, that will create 400 jobs at full capacity. The facility, to be located around two hours east of Dallas by car, will serve around 1,000 locations in the southeast U.S. Dollar General’s announcement comes just a few weeks after the company pledged to open 900 new stores in 2018, its second year expanding at such a scale. After those locations open, over 75 percent of Americans will likely live within five miles of a Dollar General, CNN Money noted earlier this month.  The company ― which sells a typical drug store’s array of products from cleaning supplies to breakfast cereals ― has grown in recent years largely thanks to low-income shoppers in rural areas that have been slow to recover from the economic downturn. Reports have indicated Dollar General is competing neck-and-neck with Wal-Mart for shoppers’ loyalty in some communities. “We are putting stores today [in areas] that perhaps five years ago were just on the cusp of probably not being our demographic,” the company’s CEO, Todd Vasos, told the Wall Street Journal in a piece published earlier this month, “and it has now turned to being our demographic.”  The chain is wildly profitable, the Journal noted, reporting that Dollar General “yielded more than double the profit of Macy’s Inc. on less revenue during its most recent fiscal year.” The Longview distribution center will be the company’s 17th and the second in the Lone Star state, following a facility that opened in San Antonio in 2016. It is expected to break ground in early 2018. So far, the Tennessee-based discount retailer operates around 14,300 stores in 44 states. In a statement, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said the state’s “dynamic and booming economy is attracting new businesses every day” and his administration is “honored to welcome Dollar General’s new distribution center to Longview as the latest example.”",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Twitter Helps Confirm X-Shaped Bulge At Center Of Milky Way,"What started out as a map of the galaxy that an astronomer shared on Twitter led to a collaboration that found strong evidence of a huge X-shaped structure formed by stars at the core of the Milky Way, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dustin Lang, an astronomer at the University of Toronto’s Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, tweeted an image from a website he created last year using data obtained by NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer space telescope, or WISE, which surveyed the entire sky in 2010.  The following image shows, at left, the WISE space telescope during its 2009 assembly at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan, Utah. At right, an illustration of the telescope as it surveyed the entire sky in infrared. Lang’s tweet showing an image of the WISE sky was spotted by Melissa Ness of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “Scientists on Twitter often share sneak peeks of interesting results or pretty pictures,” Lang said, according to CNN. When Ness saw Lang’s sky view on Twitter, she noticed something special about a group of stars at the center of the galaxy that form a bulge shape. “It was simply the most fantastic image of the Milky Way bulge that I had seen,” Ness said. “I studied the bulge for my Ph.D. and so was well aware that there are numerous works and data that demonstrate that there is an underlying X-shape in the bulge. But with that image that Dustin had made, we were clearly seeing this X-shape directly in a real image of the inner region of the galaxy for the first time.”  A few weeks after they shared emails about the significance of the X-spot, Lang and Ness met at a conference in the U.S. and embarked on a real study of the X grouping of stars. Their collaborative results are in the July issue of The Astronomical Journal. In order to reveal the actual X shape at the galaxy’s center, the scientists used original WISE imagery “and subtracted a model of how stars would be distributed in a symmetrical bulge,” according to NASA. The remaining X leftovers are seen in the following image: “There was controversy about whether the X-shaped structure existed,” Lang said in a University of Toronto statement. “But our paper gives a good view of the core of our own galaxy. I think it has provided pretty good evidence for the existence of the X-shaped structure.” This central bulge of stars further increases knowledge of the galaxy we call home. “The bulge is a key signature of formation of the Milky Way galaxy,” Ness said in the University of Toronto release. “If we understand the bulge, we will understand the key processes that have formed and shaped our galaxy.”  As treasure hunting goes, X really does mark the spot ― even an astronomical one, right here in our own galactic backyard.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Re-Introducing The Flipside,"Adding value to our users is one of the guiding principles for every product we build at HuffPost. With that goal in mind, right after the 2016 election we were inspired to create the first version of The Flipside as a tool with a very simple premise: to allow readers to explore the diversity of stories trending on Twitter at any given time on a handful of topics. Shortly after the initial launch in April of 2017, our team evaluated  performance along with user feedback, and immediately identified areas of improvement. In addition to some design and functionality issues, we also realized the experience was not ideal for mobile users. Taking in all these lessons learned, we reimagined and rebuilt The Flipside from the ground up.  We’re proud to introduce this new and improved version today.  Some of the most noticeable changes include:   We use Twitter’s Stream API to pull real time tweets that contain a set of editorially chosen terms associated with four topics:  freedom of information, international politics, war on terror, and national security. We then parse the tweets for those that contain links to entries from those news sources we’re interested in, and then we list the most recent tweet and stories.  Regarding the methodology: Ideological rankings come from a 2016 study on the political stances of news outlets by the American Association for Public Opinion Research. Not all of the news organizations featured in The Flipside were ranked in this study, so the tool does not include the toggle for those sources. The Flipside experience is a brand-sponsored initiative which will launch in conjunction with the premiere of the upcoming Hulu Original, ‘The Looming Tower’. It includes promotional ads, quotes and fact cards based on the pulitzer winning book by the same name.   We strongly believe in the value this provides to our users so expect more iterations around this concept in the future! A special thanks Troy Dunham, who redesigned this experience, Michael Dorfman, who built it all, Han Su on the technical side and Honorata Zaklicki who put it all together.  ",TECH,TECH

Elon Musk Sends Electric Car Into Space Aboard World's Most Powerful Rocket,"WASHINGTON — SpaceX made history Tuesday afternoon when it successfully launched its new Falcon Heavy rocket carrying an electric car bound for deep space and returned two of three 15-story boosters back to Earth for perfect vertical landings. The initial test launch of what is now the world’s most powerful operational rocket marks the latest milestone in billionaire Elon Musk’s quest to send humans to Mars and eventually colonize the red planet.  The Falcon Heavy consists of three Falcon 9 rockets, which SpaceX has been using for years to deploy satellites and run resupply missions to the International Space Station. With 27 engines, Falcon Heavy gives off more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff — equivalent to 18 Boeing 747 aircraft — and is capable lifting 140,000 pounds into orbit. That’s equivalent to a fully loaded 737 aircraft.  Liftoff! pic.twitter.com/2ypESsi1sF That Tuesday’s launch at 3:45 p.m. from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida went off without a hitch is remarkable.  “This is a test mission,” Musk told The New York Times ahead of liftoff. “There is so much that can go wrong.” In an interview with CNN, Musk warned that spectators could expect either “a great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they’ve ever seen.” The payload on the inaugural test flight was, rather appropriately, a product of Musk’s other brainchild, Tesla. The electric car, a red convertible Roadster, is slated to be deployed six hours after liftoff. If all goes well, it and a dummy driver named “Starman” will be sent into orbit around the sun. They will reach a speed of 7 miles per second and travel approximately 250 million miles from Earth, eventually passing close by the red planet. View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth. pic.twitter.com/QljN2VnL1O The car could remain in orbit for a billion years. And there’s an “extremely tiny” chance that it could crash into Mars, Musk told The New York Times.  “That was awesome,” a SpaceX commentator said roughly five minutes into the launch. “That’s all I can really say.”  A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 4, 2018 at 9:50pm PST Along with a successful maiden launch, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, managed to recover two of its boosters. Both were used during previous flights in 2016 and landed simultaneously on land at Cape Canaveral. Falcon Heavy side cores have landed at SpaceX’s Landing Zones 1 and 2. pic.twitter.com/oMBqizqnpI A third booster was expected to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic. But instead of capturing a successful landing, the onboard camera appeared to show smoke before cutting out entirely. More than 45 minutes after the launch, SpaceX had not provided an update on the fate of the center booster.  Flight profile #FalconHeavy #SpaceX pic.twitter.com/LlfWXqUaLP In late 2015, the company sent shockwaves through the space community when it landed a booster back on Earth — the first ever successful attempt to recover a rocket from an orbital flight. At the time a SpaceX commentator compared the feat to “launching a pencil over the Empire State Building, having it reverse, come back down, and land on a shoebox on the ground during a windstorm.”  Less than a year later, after four failed attempts to land a Falcon 9 on floating platforms in the Atlantic, SpaceX nailed a seemingly impossible at-sea landing aboard a drone ship named “Of Course I Still Love You.”  SpaceX is developing rockets that can be reused in an effort to make space flight cheaper and easier. While it costs between $200,000 to $300,000 to refill the rocket, the rocket itself costs $60 million, Musk has said.  The effort has come with many setbacks. In September 2016, for example, a Falcon 9 burst into flames on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Musk called it “the most difficult and complex failure” the company has had in its 14-year history.  In 2016, Musk unveiled plans to make humans a “multi-planet species.” He hopes to eventually build a self-sustainable Martian colony of 1 million people by building a massive “Interplanetary Transport System.” Like something out of a science fiction film, giant spaceships would shuttle upward of 100 people ― perhaps many more in the future ― plus luggage and other cargo to and from the red planet. To help pay for it, the billionaire business magnate and tech entrepreneur has proposed launching a network of 4,425 satellites ― each the size of a car ― to provide the entire globe with high-speed internet. Tuesday’s launch by SpaceX comes just a few days after BuzzFeed News published an exposé on workers’ injuries at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California. Tesla operates the only nonunion U.S.-owned vehicle plant in the nation.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Aly Raisman To Olympic Committee: Investigate USA Gymnastics Before They Elect New Leaders,"Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman on Friday called on the U.S. Olympic Committee to first complete a full independent investigation into USA Gymnastics before the sport’s governing body elects new leaders. Raisman tweeted her statement to the USOC in response to their letter to USAG on Thursday, in which they called for the entire board of directors to resign or else the sport’s governing body would lose their certification. On Friday, USAG said it would comply with the USOC’s request to have all members of the board’s remaining 18 members resign. USAG chairman Paul Parilla, vice chairman Jay Binder and treasurer Bitsy Kelley resigned Monday. In the Thursday letter, USOC CEO Scott Blackmun gave the USAG a list of steps it must take to reform the organization, including electing an interim board by the end of next month and cooperating in an independent investigation. Raisman, however, believes that the investigation should be completed ― and all the people who enabled Larry Nassar’s abuse ousted ― before new members are elected to the board. “I feel very strongly that unless and until an independent investigation is competed, we cannot be sure (1) we know the full extent of the problem, (2) that all the people who contributed to the problem have been removed and replaced, and (3) that the changes will effectively address the problem,” Raisman said in the statement. The gymnast insisted that Nassar had more victims who haven’t yet spoken out and said that it was necessary to uncover any USAG staff or board members who may have “fostered” Nassar’s actions. “What possible reason could there be for not making it a priority to know these things,” Raisman asked. “If we don’t investigate, it’s possible an individual who enabled Nassar could be appointed to the board OR the board could have the difficult task of overseeing staff that enabled Nassar.” My response to the USOC & Scott Blackmun pic.twitter.com/6Z5l6JrzCm Raisman offered the USOC her own set of requirements, asking Blackmun to ensure the investigation operates “with complete independence” and requesting that the investigation’s findings be made public at the same time it’s delivered to the USOC and USAG. Raisman, who was one of more than a hundred women who were molested by Nassar, has become one of the most vocal proponents to demand public accountability from the individuals and organizations who enabled Nassar’s rampant abuse. During an interview with the “Today” show on Thursday, Raisman criticized USAG and the USOC for prioritizing winning over athletes’ safety. Nassar “did not have a medical license in Texas, which is where we went to the ranch and trained,” Raisman said on the show. “It’s a national team training center and the Olympic training center ... so what does that say about USA Gymnastics and United States Olympic Committee? Whether they knew or didn’t know, that’s a big problem and we need to investigate how this happened.” “For so long they put medals, reputation and money over the safety of athletes,” Raisman added. “Even now, you see the United States Olympic Committee ― they just spoke out Monday for the first time. They just released a statement for the first time. They have been quiet this whole time.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
"6 Consumer Mistakes You Absolutely, Positively Must Avoid This Summer","You've probably already heard a lot of advice about what you should do do this summer -- buy this, vacation there, see that movie. But what shouldn't you do? As it turns out, summer is a time when customers make a lot of mistakes. A whole lot of mistakes. It could be the warm weather or just having a surplus of free time, or a combination of the two. But believe me, there's no shortage of stupid things we do during the warm months. ""Summer means warm weather and sunshine, which usually puts people in a good mood,"" says Vassilis Dalakas, a marketing professor at Cal State University San Marcos. ""The challenge is that consumer research has found that when we are in a good mood, we are more likely to overspend without thinking."" No one conducts surveys on the seasonality of consumer intelligence, but if they did, it would show summer as a low point. And I'm right there with you, my friends. I've been scammed, have overspent and made all kinds of unwise purchasing decisions. The worst? I paid a contractor for a new fence. He took the money and ran. More on contractors in a moment. But you don't have to become another statistic. Here are the biggest consumer mistakes you can avoid: Impulse shopping
 ""Hurried purchases are one of the main causes of buyer's remorse,"" says Krista Fabregas, who founded her own online business and now works for FitSmallBusiness.com. ""That's especially true during busy shopping seasons like summer and the holidays."" Her advice? Slow down. In many cases, the mobile apps that make online shopping easier can contribute to this problem. So get offline and review each purchase, asking yourself: ""Do I really need this?"" (Answer: Probably not.) Shopping under the influence
 You know what I'm talking about, don't you? A recent survey by Finder.com says almost almost half of Americans who regularly drink alcohol each week admit to shopping under the influence. Among the top items purchased: shoes and clothes. ""For many Americans, summer means BBQs, picnics and balmy evenings outside,"" says Finder.com's Jennifer McDermott. ""Many of these occasions are often celebrated with alcohol, which could mean a higher risk of drinking and clicking."" So keep those devices locked down when you're loaded. Buying a car
 ""Although it might seem fancy to get out in that convertible, May and June is actually when prices peak,"" says Ted Jenkin, a financial planner with Atlanta-based oXYGen Financial. Instead, wait until the end of the year, when auto prices drop. Otherwise you could be driving an overpriced convertible this summer. Buying the wrong clothes
 Specifically, the wrong swimsuit. That's the biggest summer mistake Dawn Qi sees. She runs the fashion advice site Ladyqs.com. ""It's buying an unrealistic swimsuit based on how big or small you think you will be after one more month of dieting,"" she says. ""Solution? Bring along that unapologetic friend or family member who will tell you exactly what she thinks."" If you're a guy, here's an unsolicited observation from another guy: I don't think she's talking about you. Buying something you'll only need once
 Camping gear. A barbecue. Lawn chairs. Ken Kanara calls these ""one-time use items"" and they can really drain your bank account, not to mention sit in your garage for the rest of the year and collect dust. ""The solution is to rent or to borrow from a friend,"" says Kanara, who leads the private equity practice for the Ex-Consultants Agency. (That's especially true for a boat.) Hiring the wrong contractor
 Shoddy work done by a contractor is one of the most complained-about problems, according to a recent recent survey by the Consumer Federation of America and the North American Consumer Protection Investigators. Many of these charlatans don't take the time needed to do the job right, don't listen to you or fail to even show up. And summer is peak time for substandard work. ""You have to interview the contractors and check out at least three services before deciding which to use,"" says Steve Griggs, CEO of Steve Griggs Design. Most of these problems can easily be avoided by doing your due diligence and practicing budget discipline, say experts. In other words, read the fine print and don't overspend. ""Take a page from your utilities companies’ book and budget the same amount throughout the whole year so that you can still do the things you want without putting you in a tough spot,"" says Mike Windle, retirement planning specialist at C. Curtis Financial in Plymouth, Mich. Christopher Elliott specializes in solving unsolvable consumer problems. Contact him with your questions on his advocacy website.

"LeBron Doubles Down, Says He 'Will Not Just Shut Up And Dribble'","LeBron James made it clear on Saturday that he has no intention of keeping his mouth shut and dribbling a basketball. The Cleveland Cavaliers star said after Saturday’s NBA All-Star Game practice in Los Angeles that he will “talk about what’s really important” when it comes to the state of race relations in America. Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized James earlier this week for expressing his opinions, including the quickly infamous “shut up and dribble” comment. “I will not just shut up and dribble,” James said during his media session. .”.. So, thank you, whatever her name is. ... I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids.” James has used his platform and ability to reach people. He has criticized President Donald Trump and did so again in January when he and Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant sat down with ESPN and both issued strong comments condemning the leadership in the White House. Ingraham’s comments — they included telling James to “keep the political commentary to yourself” — were in reference to the James/Durant interview. James initially put a #wewillnotshutupanddribble hashtag on his Instagram account after hearing Ingraham’s remarks. “It lets me know that everything I’ve been saying is correct for her to have that type of reaction,” James said Saturday of Ingraham. “But we will definitely not shut up and dribble. I will definitely not do that. “I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don’t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they’re in.” Durant echoed James’ comment with some of his own on Saturday. “I feel like everybody has a voice, especially with our own platforms, we can use our voices for good,” Durant said. “It’s not just me. I feel like everybody in this room has a voice and it’s getting louder and louder every day, so we’ve got to speak what we believe in, we’ve got to speak our truths, and we’ve got to keep it real out here.” Ingraham released a statement Saturday defending her comments. “In 2003, I wrote a New York Times bestseller called ‘Shut Up & Sing,’ in which I criticized celebrities like the Dixie Chicks and Barbra Streisand, who were trashing then-President George W. Bush. I have used a variation of that title for more than 15 years to respond to performers who sound off on politics,” Ingraham said. .”.. If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they’re called out for insulting politicians. There was no racial intent in my remarks ― false, defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
Trump To Announce Whether U.S. Will Break The Iran Nuclear Deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will announce on Tuesday whether he will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal or stay in and work with European allies who have struggled to persuade him that it has successfully halted Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump has consistently threatened to pull out of the 2015 agreement because it does not address Iran’s ballistic missile program or its role in wars in Syria and Yemen, and does not permanently prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. European leaders have warned that a U.S. withdrawal would undo years of work that led to and sustained a landmark deal that has kept nuclear weapons out of Iran’s hands. It could also ratchet up tensions in a region riven with interrelated conflicts, including the multi-layered conflict in Syria where Iran’s presence has brought it into conflict with Israel. It will also impact oil markets due to Iran’s role as a major exporter. “This deal ... is a factor of peace and stabilization in a very eruptive region,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly told RTL radio. Trump, in a tweet on Monday, said he would make the announcement at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday. Iran suggested its economy would not be hurt whatever happened, but its rial was near record lows against the dollar in the free market as Iranians tried to buy hard currency, fearing financial turmoil if Trump quits the deal. “We are prepared for all scenarios. If America pulls out of the deal, our economy will not be impacted,” central bank chief Valiollah Seif said on state television. “One man in one country might create some problems for us for a few months, but we will overcome those problems,” President Hassan Rouhani said in televised remarks. “If we are under sanctions or not, we should stand on our own feet. This is very important for the development of our country,” Rouhani said. A senior U.S. official close to the process said France, Germany and Britain had moved significantly to address Trump’s concerns over the ballistic missile program, the terms under which international inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites and “sunset” clauses under which some terms of the deal expire. But it was not clear whether those last-ditch efforts had made enough progress to persuade Trump to stay in the pact. A senior French official appeared unconvinced about a possible meeting of minds between Trump and the Europeans. “I think in Washington it was quite clear the president was convinced that Trump was heading to a negative decision so we have been preparing more aggressively the hypotheses of a partial or total pullout”, the official said. The Iran deal, negotiated during the administration of Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. Trump has called it the “worst deal ever negotiated” and he wants Britain, France and Germany - which also signed the pact along with Russia and China - to toughen up the terms. In the past few weeks, the Republican president has consulted either in person or by telephone with leaders of all three countries. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson made the rounds in Washington on Monday, including talks with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Still, European diplomats privately said they expected Trump to withdraw from the agreement. Two White House officials and a source familiar with the debate inside the administration said last week Trump had all but decided to pull out. Under the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States committed to ease a series of U.S. sanctions on Iran and it has done so under “waivers” that effectively suspend them. Trump has until Saturday to decide whether to extend the waivers or withdraw and reintroduce sanctions related to Iran’s central bank and Iranian oil exports. That would dissuade foreign companies from doing business with Iran because they could be subject to U.S. penalties. Iran has said it will not renegotiate the accord and threatened to retaliate if the United States pulls out, although it has not said how. Diplomats and military experts say Tehran could seek to resume its nuclear arms program or step up its military involvement in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.   The Kremlin said on Tuesday the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal would have harmful consequences. Rouhani suggested on Monday that Iran might remain in the nuclear deal even if Trump abandons it and imposes sanctions. But he also warned that Tehran would fiercely resist U.S. efforts to limit its influence in the Middle East. Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, although it neither confirms nor denies possessing atomic weapons. Financial markets are also watching Trump’s decision closely. On Tuesday, oil retreated from 3-1/2 year highs as investors waited for Trump’s statement. Economists inside and outside Iran said the rial was being driven down by heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who feared a U.S. pullout from the agreement would lead to the resumption of U.S. sanctions against Tehran, deterring other nations in Europe and Asia from developing business ties.",POLITICS,POLITICS
NFL Bans Kneeling During The National Anthem,"The NFL on Wednesday approved a new policy to intercept national anthem protests before they happen, according to the league. The measure mandates that players who are on the field must stand for the national anthem but can remain in the locker room if they choose. Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s initial kneeling protest in 2016 earned nationwide attention. The fining or punishment of players and other personnel would be dictated by the individual teams. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement Wednesday that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.” “This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,” he said. “Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.” The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter. “Our union will review the new ‘policy’ and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,” the union said. On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated reported on a different, apparently scrapped, proposal in which teams could be penalized on the field for players kneeling. In that scenario, the home team would decide whether both teams would come out of the locker room for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” And if the teams do emerge and players kneel, officials could assess a 15-yard penalty, the outlet wrote, citing unnamed sources. “As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told HuffPost in an email early Wednesday. “The clubs explore every option and idea on any policy, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach. We will continue the conversation this morning.” The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump. Kaepernick, who was not signed by an NFL team in 2017 after he became a free agent, and former teammate Eric Reid, who also protested, have filed grievances against the league for allegedly conspiring to keep them off NFL rosters because of the demonstrations.

Adorable Tiger Cubs Turn Into Fearsome Big Cats Over Course Of 1 Year,"My, how they've grown! Yorkshire Wildlife Park marked a trio of Amur tigers' first birthday in style in northern England on Tuesday. The park celebrated Hector, Harley and Hope's landmark occasion with the release of adorable video showing how much they've grown over the past 12 months: The footage shows their transformation from helpless newborns entirely dependent on their mom, Tschuna, into fearsome, big cats, who prowl and play fight as if they're going in for the kill. The park posted the video to YouTube and Facebook on Tuesday with the message, ""Happy 1st birthday to our very special (not so little anymore) tiger cubs, Harley, Hector and Hope!"" The tigers have since been a great hit with visitors since their March 2015 birth, as ""they are always up to mischief,"" the park said on its website.  The cubs live at the park with their mom and dad, Vladimir, and another tiger called Sayan. It's believed there are only around 540 of the endangered big cats, also known as Siberian tigers, living in the wild in their native forests of the Russian Far East. They are at risk from poachers, the illegal wildlife trade and loss of habitat from illegal logging, according to the conservation nonprofit World Wildlife Fund for Nature. ",SCIENCE,ENVIRONMENT
This Tiny Robot Stingray Made From Gold And Rat Hearts Can Also Swim,"Scientists have unveiled a miniature robotic stingray the size of a toenail that sails smoothly through water, guided by pulses of light. The bio-inspired robot is a made of a mixture of living rat heart cells and artificial material. It is only 16 millimeters long ― less than two-thirds of an inch ― and weighs just 10 grams, or a third of an ounce. Just like stingrays and their Batoid relatives, the robot moves its flat body smoothly through water by flapping its fins in a wave-like motion. The movement of the fins is controlled by light pulses delivered to the heart muscles that line the surface of the fins. The development of the robot ray is described in the journal Science on Thursday. Kevin Kit Parker, an applied physicist at Harvard University who led the team of researchers, said the robot ray could interest scientists in a variety of fields ― from the cardiac physiologist interested in how the muscular architecture of the heart creates its unique pumping function, to the robotics engineer looking to use cells as a living engineering material. Parker himself specializes in developing tiny human organs that can be used to test drug safety and efficacy. But he took a detour into robotics after a visit to an aquarium with his daughter a couple of years ago. “The ‘eureka’ moment for the project came when my daughter Caroline and I were at the New England Aquarium,” Parker told The Huffington Post. “She was trying to pet a stingray. She put her hand in the water and the stingray quickly moved away from her hand in a very elegant way,” Parker said.   He realized he could build a system with musculature similar to cell layers of the heart. “It struck me like a thunderbolt.”  Parker and his colleagues created the robot ray out of a gold skeleton in the shape of a stingray, covered with a thin layer of flexible polymer.  Next came the brain and muscle of the ray: an orderly lined sheath of approximately 200,000 heart muscle cells, grown from a rat embryo and put on top of the robot. To control the cells, the team turned to optogenetics, a method often used in neuroscience studies as a way to switch neurons on and off with light. Neurons or heart muscles don’t naturally respond to light. But in optogenetics, the cells are upgraded with a chunk of DNA. This special DNA codes for a protein that responds to light, rendering the cells light-sensitive.  Now, with a burst of light, the modified cells contract, sending a downward wave through the fins. When the cells relax, the robot’s skeleton pushes the fins back up. The result is a swimming robot ray that follows the light source. Parker notes that in this design the cells are both the sensors and actuators, which comes with benefits and disadvantages: While living muscle cells are much more energy-efficient than synthetic actuators, they are also vulnerable. And to stay alive, they need to be immersed in a warm solution with salt and sugar.  “Cells as a building material have a vote in whether or not I am going to have a good day in the lab,” Parker said. “They like to be wet, they are both robust and vulnerable, and they die.” Applying a source of light to each fin allowed the researchers to stimulate the right or left fin and steer the robot in either direction. Different frequencies of light control how fast the fins, and hence the robot, move about. Adam Summers, director of the Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics Lab at the University of Washington, called the robot “a technical tour de force combining tissue engineering, robotics, organismal biology and biomechanics to yield a functional device.” “That they got it to flap is wonderful. That they were able to steer it is nothing short of amazing,” he said. Parker’s interest in aquatic creatures overlaps with his interest in understanding how the heart and various aspects of the anatomy help move blood in the body. And pumping and moving fluids is something marine life forms are very good at, he said. “The idea is to get a better insight into the human heart and heart disease by reverse engineering other forms of muscular pumps that we see in nature,” he said.

"Google Doodle Honors Fred Korematsu, Activist Who Fought Japanese Internment","Monday’s Google Doodle celebrated the birthday of Fred Korematsu, a Japanese-American who defied government orders to relocate to an internment camp during World War II.  Fred Korematsu's 98th Birthday - #GoogleDoodle in  United States. #FredKorematsu pic.twitter.com/CfZdeKVMRQ In 1942, Korematsu was one of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent who were forced to leave their homes and most of their worldly possessions under Executive Order No. 9066. The order, signed by then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) in response to Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor, gave the U.S. Army the green light to round up Japanese-Americans and place them in designated military zones. The effort was later considered a low point in U.S. history, a moment where fear overwhelmed tolerance.  Korematsu refused to comply with the order and fled from his home in San Leandro, California to Oakland. Korematsu was soon captured and convicted, but he appealed the decision. The Supreme Court ruled against him 6-3, though the conviction was vacated in 1983. In the original Supreme Court ruling, dissenting Justice Robert Jackson said that the only crime Korematsu committed was “being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born and where all his life he has lived.” Justice Frank Murphy called the executive order “legalization of racism.”  “It is the case of convicting a citizen as a punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States,” they wrote. “If this be a correct statement of the facts disclosed by this record, and facts of which we take judicial notice, I need hardly labor the conclusion that Constitutional rights have been violated.” Seventy-five years later, the statement bears resemblance to comments made by activists across the country over the weekend in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning people from majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In New York, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the federal government as travelers coming from the seven countries named in the order were detained and interrogated at airports across the U.S.  In response, a federal judge blocked part of the executive order and said that “the petitioners have a strong likelihood of success in establishing that the removal of the petitioners and others similarly situated violates the rights to Due Process and Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution.” Judges in Seattle, Massachusetts and Virginia made similar rulings. CORRECTION: This story previously stated that the ruling convicting Fred Korematsu was overturned. The conviction was vacated, but the ruling was not overturned.",TECH,TECH
Congress Does Wall Street A Favor As Banks Post Record Profits,"WASHINGTON ― Congress sent a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk Tuesday intended to roll back regulations adopted after the 2008 financial crisis, weakening consumer protection and modestly increasing the risk of another banking collapse. The bill’s passage marks the second major legislative victory for both Trump and the financial sector, following last year’s tax cut. The package will benefit banks both large and small, limit consumer remedies against credit reporting agencies including the scandal-plagued Equifax, curb the government’s ability to collect data on racial discrimination in the housing market, and allow large regional banks to rely on more risky debt to finance their operations. Tuesday’s 258-159 House vote came as banks are posting record profits thanks to a stronger economy and lower tax rates. The U.S. banking industry posted a combined $56 billion profit in the first quarter of 2018, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, its best three-month stint in history. Community banks ― smaller institutions in rural parts of the country that proponents of the bill claimed were in need of particular aid ― also posted billions in net profits. Nevertheless, banks still need deregulation, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said. “Big banks keep getting bigger,” Cole told HuffPost on Tuesday. “Small banks are being regulated out of existence.” With Republicans in control of the House, the bill’s eventual approval was a fait accompli after 17 Senate Democrats voted for it in March.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law included a host of consumer protections and risk management rules that apply to all banks. But it applied tougher rules to the largest banks, since the failure of a large firm can have dire consequences for the broader economy. Banks with at least $50 billion in assets have to undergo frequent stress-testing by the Federal Reserve to determine whether they could withstand an unexpected financial shock. They must finance their operations with more capital and less borrowed money, and they have to keep more cash on hand.  The bill approved Tuesday would change the definition of what constitutes the biggest banks, freeing banks with up to $250 billion in assets from these tougher rules. Huge regional players like BB&T and SunTrust would be exempted, as would foreign conglomerates with trillions of dollars in global assets ― like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and UBS ― that keep less than $250 billion of their assets in the United States. “Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial system,” former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker wrote in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who voted against the legislation. Volcker in particular highlighted the risks posed by curtailing oversight of “several large foreign banks,” suggesting that a $100 billion threshold would be more appropriate. When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the legislation in March, it concluded that while the risk of another banking crash in any specific year was small, the odds “would be slightly greater under the legislation.” The risk would be worth making it easier for small and intermediate-sized banks to provide credit, Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House financial services committee, said Tuesday. “Everything in life is a balancing act.” Banking analysts also expect large regional banks to acquire more small community lenders as a result of the bill, since they will not be penalized with tougher regulations for growing past the $50 billion mark. The subprime mortgage crisis revealed that banks had systematically steered families of color into expensive, predatory loans. Dodd-Frank sought to address this in part by requiring lenders to report a host of data to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition to basic facts about loan approval or denial, lenders had to report a borrower’s age and credit score, as well as the property value of the home being purchased, the interest rate, loan terms, and other pricing features of each mortgage. The CFPB could use all of this data to determine whether families of color were being improperly overcharged or pushed into bad loans.  The bill approved Tuesday would exempt 85 percent of banks from those new anti-discrimination reporting requirements, in an effort to save paperwork costs. A host of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, have all assailed the provision. The bill also contains several provisions that are supposed to benefit consumers, such as by requiring credit monitoring firms to let people freeze their credit reports, which contain personal financial information that companies like Equifax, Experian and TransUnion collect without prior consent. Equifax proved a poor custodian of that information last year when the company announced hackers had stolen personal data relating to more than 140 million Americans. Consumer advocates say the supposed benefits are actually a mixed bag, because some provisions would preempt more generous state laws and others could prevent consumers from joining class-action lawsuits.  One provision is a straightforward giveaway to Equifax and its ilk, since it would force government-backed mortgage companies to consider using their credit-scoring algorithm as part of the home lending process. Liberal and conservative groups alike, as well as other housing finance stakeholders, oppose the provision.  Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), another member of the House financial services committee, dismissed concerns about restricting consumers from being able to join class-action lawsuits, noting that they can still settle disputes by arbitration. “You’re choosing to focus on one of the credit rating agencies,” he told HuffPost when asked how the bill would affect Equifax. “I think that goes far beyond the very narrow focus that you’re taking on it. Consumers should always have remedies for bad actors, always.”",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Why Most States Are Struggling To Regulate Airbnb,"By Elaine S. Povich   Jeannette Belliveau lives with her dog and two cats in a 19th century house in the Upper Fells Point section of Baltimore, not far from Johns Hopkins Hospital, and rents out a couple of rooms for short-term stays to make a living. In other parts of the city, Al Hallivis, a real estate investor and single dad, owns a half-dozen houses that he also rents by the night. A few miles toward the city’s picturesque harbor, a variety of hotels offer traditional overnight stays. All three models cater to Baltimore visitors, but that’s where the similarity ends. Belliveau, Hallivis, and hotels have different business models, different perspectives and different agendas. These competing constituencies help account for the difficulty states have had in regulating and taxing the short-term rental industry, even as some cities have taken action to regulate short-term rentals.   “One-size-fits-all state regulation may not always be the most appropriate policy response, and states may therefore choose to allow local governments to regulate,” said Kellen Zale, a law professor at the University of Houston who has done research on the short-term rental market. Some big cities, such as New York, saw the short-term rentals as a threat to the rental market based on long-term leases, as well as to traditional hotels. New York last year allocated extra funding to enforce a state law restricting rentals for fewer than 30 days unless the host is present and there are no more than two guests. Other cities saw the short-term rentals as a potential source of income and sought to expand tourist or hotel taxes to the new schemes, with varying success.   San Francisco this year began limiting the number of nights a year absentee owners can rent their properties through Airbnb or similar platforms. Owners who live in their residence can rent it out without limit. Owners also must pay a $250 registration fee to the city. Short-term rentals in San Francisco dropped by 55 percent after the limitations took effect, according to the San Francisco Chronicle and Host Compliance, a company that helps cities keep track of short-term rentals. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., regulations go into effect in July that will limit the short-term rentals to the homeowner’s primary residence. Rentals where the homeowner is not present will be limited to 120 nights in a calendar year. Were Baltimore County to adopt that type of rule, Hallivis said it would kill his business model. Montgomery County also is collecting hotel taxes on the short-term rental properties. That model, Belliveau said, would make her profit margin, already slim, even tighter. “I’m opposed to taxing rooms in my house. I’m just Mrs. Murphy,” Belliveau said, referring to the hypothetical elderly widow who has converted a portion of her home into a rental apartment. Under federal housing law, the “Mrs. Murphy’s exemption” provides that if a dwelling has four or fewer units and the owner lives in one of them, that home is exempt from the Fair Housing Act. Troy Flanagan, vice president of government affairs and industry relations for the American Hotel and Lodging Association, said his group doesn’t oppose “true home sharing” like Belliveau’s — it objects to people who have rental property that they use exclusively for short stays. The industry group has mounted a coordinated attack against those multi-dwelling short-term rental owners.   “Increasingly what’s taking place on those platforms is hosts that have dozens of units that are available every day of the year, and that’s a hotel,” Flanagan said. “Home sharing is sharing your home, not sharing your second, third or fourth home.” Hallivis insists that his houses are not hotels, and that he helps neighborhoods by fixing up vacant houses and turning them into nice-looking properties. By bringing in people with money to spend, he said, he also gives a boost to neighborhood restaurants, mom-and-pop stores and taverns. Private residences generally are not held to the same safety standards, such as requirements for sprinkler systems or handicapped access, as commercial rentals. Hotels in general must have those, as well as emergency exit directions, emergency lighting and fire doors. Hallivis said his homes have fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. He noted that in fiscal 2017, about $17 billion was spent in Maryland on hotels and the rest of the tourism industry, and $42 million was spent on short-term rentals from Airbnb. “We don’t hurt the hotel industry at all,” he said. “They want a monopoly.” In addition to Maryland, about 15 states debated bills to regulate the short-term rental industry this year. Only one, Indiana’s, was signed into law. Nebraska’s governor vetoed a bill approved by that state’s Legislature. A bill to regulate the industry also died in Hawaii. The Indiana bill protects the ability of homeowners to offer short-term rentals, and prohibits cities from banning rentals of a primary residence, while allowing them to impose fees or taxes. The bill vetoed in Nebraska was similar. In New Albany, Indiana, just across the Ohio River from Louisville, Ruth Ann Floyd rents out one room in her 1880s-era house. Reached just days before the Kentucky Derby, she said she’s booked solid for Derby week. A 69-year-old retiree from General Electric’s refrigerator manufacturing plant, Floyd is pleased that the state protected her little rental business but concerned about the fees that the city might impose. “Every bit of money I take in I put back into the house,” she said as grandchildren shrieked in the background. “If the city comes up with a big fee, I’m not going to keep doing it.” New Albany’s city council president, Al Knable, said he is not in favor of large fees, but collecting the current 4 percent tourist tax — now just assessed on a couple of hotels in the county — might be appropriate. He’d like to see Airbnb and the other platforms collect and remit the tax, not the local homeowners. The proposal that passed the Indiana Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb in March would not restrict owner-occupied rentals. But it would limit how many days absentee owners can rent their properties and allow for rules on which amenities, such as parking, they must provide. The law also allows for local permitting and taxing. Maryland state Sen. John Astle, who authored the bill to regulate and tax short-term rentals in his state, said there was stiff resistance to a statewide bill, particularly the part about collecting hotel taxes. Astle is ready to concede that regulations should be left to local jurisdictions. But the tax issue is dependent on the state Legislature. The Anne Arundel County Democrat said he plans to meet with city officials in his hometown of Annapolis to press his case for local regulation. He said short-term rentals have detracted from his city’s neighborhood feel, and that “if you are going to rent something, you ought to have the health and safety issues that are required in any kind of commercial rental.” But Matt Kiessling, a vice president at the Travel Technology Association, which represents online platforms, says the travel industry is big enough for a variety of accommodations. “Hotels are ripping and roaring from a business standpoint, with the highest occupancy rate ever,” he said. “Short-term rentals are exploding. … One isn’t taking away from the other; the pie is just getting bigger. All the internet has done is make that market more efficient by allowing travelers to find a home and homeowners to rent a home.”   Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research ",POLITICS,BUSINESS
16 Senators Back U.S. Women's Hockey Team's Fair Pay Boycott,"The U.S. women’s national hockey team’s ongoing boycott of the upcoming women’s world championship gained new supporters on Monday, when 16 members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to the sport’s American governing body demanding fair treatment for female players. The boycott began on March 15, when members of the team announced they would not play in the International Ice Hockey Federation Women’s World Championship ― which begins March 31 ― without “significant progress” in negotiations with USA Hockey over fair pay and other forms of financial support. “We urge you to resolve this dispute quickly to ensure that the USA Women’s National Hockey Team receives equitable resources,” the senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), wrote in the letter addressed to USA Hockey Executive Director Dave Ogrean. “These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics.” Warren was joined by 13 of her colleagues, all Democrats: Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.). Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) also signed the letter but were not listed on the original copy.  In launching the boycott, members of the U.S. women’s team said they wanted better compensation from USA Hockey, which provides them with monthly stipends during a six-month Olympic training period, but does not pay them for the other three and a half years of each Olympic cycle. They also said other forms of financial support ― for marketing, travel and youth development, among other things ― pales in comparison to what the federation provides men’s teams. In their letter, the senators cited the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, a federal law that applies to governing bodies like USA Hockey. Under that law, the senators wrote,  USA Hockey is “legally required to provide equitable support and encouragement for participation by women.” .@usahockey should step up & treat all our national athletes the same. This will send a powerful message around the globe. #BeBoldForChange Players and USA Hockey officials met last Monday to resume negotiations, and the players emerged from more than eight hours of meetings confident that they were close to a deal that would allow them to return to the ice for the tournament. But negotiations fell apart later in the week, and USA Hockey resumed its efforts to field a replacement team at the world championship. Those efforts have been largely unsuccessful, with some collegiate and even high school women’s players posting on Twitter that they have turned down USA Hockey’s requests. The senators joined a growing list of supporters of the team’s boycott. Members of the U.S. women’s soccer team ― which is battling its own federation over equal pay issues ― spoke out almost immediately, as did former members of the women’s hockey team. The NFL and Major League Baseball players’ unions have also supported the team. Reports emerged Sunday that members of the U.S. men’s hockey team were considering joining the women’s boycott of the world championship. USA Hockey’s board was scheduled to meet Monday afternoon to vote on a potential deal that could end the boycott. The women’s team members still want to play in the tournament. On Friday, forward Monique Lamoureux told The Huffington Post that players “will show up the day before the game if we have to” ― as long as they reach a deal with USA Hockey first.  Read the full letter below. March 27, 2017Dave OgreanExecutive DirectorUSA Hockey 1775 Bob Johnson Drive Colorado Springs, CO 80906 Dear Mr. Ogrean, As Senators committed to gender equity in all realms of American life, we write to express our serious concern with allegations raised by members of the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team regarding USA Hockey’s inequitable allocation of resources to the women’s hockey program and unjust treatment of national team members. As you know, the women’s team has chosen to boycott the upcoming International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championship games, citing faltering negotiations with USA Hockey regarding equitable pay and resources. Among other issues, the women note that USA Hockey expects female players to “train full time and compete throughout the year,” yet pays them only $6,000 every four years, an amount that would put them far below the poverty line. The women’s team is in the process of negotiating a four-year contract with USA Hockey that includes “appropriate compensation.” As the National Governing Body for ice hockey in the United States, USA Hockey is required by the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act to “develop interest and participation throughout the United States” in ice hockey and “be responsible to the persons and amateur sports organizations it represents.” USA Hockey is also legally required to “provide equitable support and encouragement for participation by women where separate programs for male and female athletes are conducted on a national basis.” We are disturbed by reports from the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team suggesting that USA Hockey is not providing “equitable support” to female athletes. While USA Hockey provides its male athletes with a “seemingly endless” supply of hockey equipment, for example, female players are often expected to “buy their own.” This “inequitable support for equipment, staff, meals, travel expenses, transportation, and publicity” is apparent at younger levels of the sport as well: while USA Hockey spends $3.5 million to support male youth athletes in its National Team Development Program, there is no parallel development program for women. The U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team has medaled in every Olympics since 1998, when Women’s Hockey was first added as an Olympic Sport. The team has won gold medals at the IIHF World Championships for the past three years in a row. As Megan Duggan, team captain, announced last week, the women’s team has “represented our country with dignity and deserves to be treated with fairness and respect.” We urge you to resolve this dispute quickly to ensure that the USA Women’s National Hockey Team receives equitable resources. These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics.

Facebook Gives Pathetic Excuse For Its Diversity Problems,"Facebook says it’s having trouble hiring people of color because public schools are failing to educate them properly. The company is 52 percent white, 38 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic and 2 percent black, according to diversity numbers released Thursday. Sixty-seven percent of Facebook employees are male overall. In a blog post about the data, Maxine Williams, Facebook’s global head of diversity, offered an excuse that belies the social network’s status as one of the most valuable and resource-rich companies in the entire world. “It has become clear that at the most fundamental level, appropriate representation in technology or any other industry will depend upon more people having the opportunity to gain necessary skills through the public education system,” Williams wrote. The so-called “pipeline” problem is a familiar argument, and it’s valid to an extent. It’s true that computer science isn’t a requirement in many public high schools, which theoretically means the populations most dependent on public education are less well-equipped to pursue engineering in college. Facebook’s blog post explains that minorities and females were less likely to take the College Board’s Advanced Placement exam in Computer Science, for example. “In 2015, seven states had fewer than 10 girls take the Advanced Placement Computer Science exam and no girls took the exam in three states,” Williams wrote. “No Black people took the exam in nine states including Mississippi where about 50% of high school graduates are Black, and 18 states had fewer than 10 Hispanics take the exam with another five states having no Hispanic AP Computer Science (CS) test takers,” she added. Then again, Facebook isn’t hiring high school students. And it also has a whole lot of jobs that have nothing to do with computer science. Those roles are also mostly occupied by white people, though the genders are close to balanced. Leslie Miley, director of engineering at Slack and an outspoken advocate of diversity in Silicon Valley, said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday that Facebook’s statement was a “fucking insult.” “You can quote me on that,” he added. Facebook has pledged to do better. Black representation in non-tech roles grew from 3 percent last year to 5 percent now. And the company is promising $15 million (or .004 percent of the company’s $336 billion market value today) to the nonprofit Code.org for computer science education over the next five years. Code.org has supplied training and resources to public schools for years, but it also offers unconventional online courses that anyone can access if, say, they aren’t in a position to take an AP test. “Are you going to make a commitment to hire from these programs?” Miley said.  In response to Miley’s criticisms, a Facebook spokeswoman told HuffPost that the company aggressively markets its Facebook University program to colleges across the United States as a means to serve “underrepresented communities.” Facebook University is a sort of pre-internship program for students to enroll in after their freshman year of college, and it’s open to people without strong computer science backgrounds. It’s paid, with housing and meals provided by Facebook. The spokeswoman would not say how many students from Facebook University or the company’s other internship programs are ultimately hired full-time by the social network. But she said Facebook University has grown from 30 students to 170 in recent years. Still, Miley told HuffPost that the bottom line is that Facebook could easily find more people of color to hire if it wanted to ― it would just have to adjust how it recruits and values candidates. Facebook is free to hire whom it wants, but if diversity is a priority, as the company states, then it needs to change its formula. “Facebook is looking for people who are already like them, looking for students that they can turn into Facebook employees, and really denying the individuality that students of color can bring to the table,” Miley said.

Climate Change Through Sound: Video Shows Rising Temperatures With Cello Music,"A Song of Our Warming Planet from Ensia on Vimeo. This summer has been a tumultuous one so far, weather-wise. Heat waves, wildfires and floods have plagued the nation. Climate change has been at the forefront of the conversation, attracting the attention of President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and even the former CEO of two power companies. While scientists and activists have tried a number of ways to relay the magnitude of the climate situation, charts and statistics don't necessarily resonate with everyone. That is why Daniel Crawford, a student at the University of Minnesota, has come up with a new way to visualize our warming planet: by utilizing sound as a measure of temperature.

NFL Investigating Jameis Winston After Uber Driver Says The Quarterback Groped Her,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston allegedly groped a female Uber drive in March 2016, according to a report from BuzzFeed published Friday.  The Uber driver, referred to as “Kate” throughout the BuzzFeed article, said she had been working as a driver for two years when she picked up Winston in downtown Scottsdale, Arizona, around 2 a.m. on March 13, 2016. According to Kate, Winston was the only passenger and his friends put him in the front seat of her car.  Winston immediately began behaving inappropriately and shouting homophobic slurs at people on the sidewalk, Kate told BuzzFeed. Winston then asked to stop to get food. While waiting in a drive-thru line, Kate said Winston “reached over and he just grabbed [her] crotch.” She said he held his hand there for three to five seconds until she looked at him and said, “What’s up with that?” “I wasn’t just creeped out. I was frozen,” Kate said. “I mean he’s an NFL quarterback and I’m 5-foot-6. I’m not prepared for that. So I completely froze.”  Kate, who no longer works for Uber, filed a complaint with the company right after the incident happened. Uber responded to the allegations in a statement to BuzzFeed: “The behavior the driver reported is disturbing and wrong. The rider was permanently removed from the app shortly after we learned of the incident.” (The account holder who ordered the Uber has been removed from the ride-sharing service, but it’s not clear if that account is Winston’s.)  Winston tweeted a statement on Friday afternoon responding to the groping allegations, calling them “false.” “I believe the driver was confused as to the number of passengers in the car and who was sitting next to her,” the statement read. “The accusation is false, and given the nature of the allegation and increased awareness and consideration of these types of matters, I am addressing this false report immediately. At the time of the alleged incident, I denied the allegations to Uber, yet they still decided to suspend my account.”  “I am supportive of the national movement to raise awareness and develop better responses to the concerns of parties who find themselves in these types of situations, but this accusation is false,” it continued. “While I am certain that I did not make any inappropriate contact, I don’t want to engage in a battle with the driver and I regret if my demeanor or presence made her uncomfortable in any way.” According to a letter obtained by BuzzFeed that was sent to Kate from Lisa Friel, the NFL’s special counsel for investigations, the NFL is looking into the accusations.  Winston has been in the headlines for allegations of sexual misconduct before. Winston was accused of raping a fellow student in 2012 while attending and playing football at Florida State University. In a 2015 civil complaint, the woman sued Winston for “sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising out of forcible rape.” Winston denied the allegations, claiming the two had consensual sex.  Although Winston was never formally charged for the alleged rape, FSU paid the woman $950,000 in January 2016 as a settlement for a lawsuit she filed against the university that said the school had mishandled her case.  Kate told BuzzFeed that she came forward with her story to ensure what she says happened to her doesn’t happen to other women.  “I have been empowered by my sisters who have forged this path by speaking up, and I must do my part to make it a little more well traveled,” she said. “If I’m silent, I fear that further harm will come to other women, if it hasn’t already. He sexually assaulted me, and I have every right to tell the damn truth about it.” ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Ingenious Hack Turns Amazon Dash Button Into Trump-Fighting Machine,"Ordering Doritos on demand is pretty great, but this is such a better use of your Amazon Dash button. Programmer Nathan Pryor heard his friend wish for a device that would let her donate to the American Civil Liberties Union with the push of a button in response to reading news about President Donald Trump and his administration’s problematic new policies.  “Her language was sliiiiightly more colorful than that, but it got me thinking: why reserve that instant gratification for physical goods?” Pryor wrote in a post on Medium. “Why not push a button and do some real good?” For the uninitiated, Amazon created dash buttons as a one-stop-shop for ordering common household items. They provide the little devices that you can stick anywhere. Customers link the button to their credit cards and specific products on Amazon, like toilet paper or snacks, and place them in convenient locations around the house. The company released a customizable version for creative programmers like Pryor. He ordered one, wrote a program, tested it out, et voila: the Trump-fighting machine you never knew you needed. “I built an Amazon Dash button that donates $5 to the ACLU every time I click it, allowing an immediate, physical response when I read news of further assaults on our civil liberties,” Pryor wrote on the caption of the video he uploaded to YouTube.  “I doubt there will be any shortage of reason to push [the button] in the coming days, unfortunately,” he told The Huffington Post via email. Pryor’s invention made headlines quickly, with folks on Twitter asking the programmer if he could make similar versions for other organizations, like Planned Parenthood. GEEKS: somebody make one of these for @PPFA. https://t.co/se3566SLQO “I’d love to see these become a real product with different organizations available, but it would need to be done with Amazon’s help since the Dash is their product and they’re a gatekeeper to the service,” Pryor added. Donations to the ACLU, which sees itself as a leading charge against the Trump administration, skyrocketed since the president signed the executive order banning refugees and citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The ACLU said it raised more than $24 million in online donations in the few days after the travel ban was signed.",TECH,TECH
Football Fans Lose Faith In Humanity As Patriots Head To Another Super Bowl,"Football fans were utterly distressed Sunday night as the New England Patriots secured a spot in yet another Super Bowl. The Patriots scored in the last quarter of the AFC championship against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 20-24 win. Jacksonville was leading for the majority of the game and was up by 3 points in the fourth quarter when Patriots receiver Danny Amendola scored with less than 3 minutes left in the game. This marks the eighth Super Bowl appearance for the team since 2000, and while Patriots fans are rejoicing, quite a few football fans are tired of the team’s repeated arrival to the biggest game in the NFL.  Twitter was overrun with disapproval and despair. “Who are: the New England Patriots?”#JeopardySports #JAXvsNE pic.twitter.com/Z90XLus0P9 Ugh, I'd rather eat a tide pod than watch another Patriots Superbowl. wife: how do the patriots keep doing this?Me: because we live in a fallen world where evil must exist to facilitate an appreciation of joy. this too shall passWife: ...ok take it easy on the bourbon champ Anooooother patriots super bowl.

Cruise Ship Workers Appear To Throw Bags Of Garbage Right Into The Ocean (VIDEO),"Newly released undercover videos appear to show a cruise ship employee casually tossing bags of garbage straight into the ocean.  The videos (see below) were purportedly filmed aboard the Magnifica, a cruise ship owned by the Geneva-based company MSC Cruises.  The footage was allegedly filmed covertly by a former Magnifica crewman, who sent them to blogger and maritime lawyer Jim Walker. Walker posted them to his blog, Cruise Law News, on March 4.  Throwing garbage into the ocean is not only an environmental hazard, it's a violation of international law.  Watch: (Story continues below) WATCH: In an emailed statement to HuffPost, MSC Cruises said that these videos are merely another angle of an incident reported last year in Brazilian media (and also covered by Jim Walker). In that incident, video filmed by a passenger above deck appeared to show bags of trash being flung off the ship and right into the ocean.  HuffPost was unable to confirm that the latest videos are of the same incident.  MSC Cruises says ""a full investigation is being conducted into the issue"" and that ""new stringent procedures have been enacted ... to further discipline crew members for breaches of the company's stringent anti-pollution policies.""

Whole Foods' Yom Kippur Cake Doesn't Seem To Get The Holiday,"A shopper in Whole Foods came across the most puzzling of cakes for sale ― a sheet cake celebrating Yom Kippur. According to The Forward, a shopper at a Whole Foods in Rockville, Maryland came across a cake emblazoned with “Yom Kippur!” on it, accompanied by pomegranates, apples, a fish, a menorah and a honey pot. Now, cakes are great, but probably not the best idea for a holiday that involves fasting. Also, pomegranates, apples, and honey are all symbols usually associated with Rosh Hashanah ― which is an entirely different Jewish holiday that happened last week.  “I’m sure the baker had good intentions,” wrote The Forward’s Jen Simon. “They were probably trying to help their customers celebrate what they knew was an important holiday. But, if I may, a suggestion for the next time to the baker or any other well-intentioned person bent on inclusion – don’t.” A Whole Foods spokesperson told HuffPost that the “cake was intended as dessert for the breaking of the fast dinner and a customer purchased it yesterday afternoon for that purpose.” Though, that doesn’t explain some of the symbols that seem haphazardly thrown on the cake.  Anyway, we happen to agree with Simon’s sentiments in The Forward: Stop trying to make Yom Kippur cakes happen, Whole Foods. Cakes aren’t meant to be educational; they’re meant to be delicious. And while I bet this one is, I don’t think we’ll be eating it on Yom Kippur.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
ESPN President John Skipper Resigns Unexpectedly,"ESPN President and Disney Media Networks Co-Chairman John Skipper resigned Monday, citing a struggle with addiction. “Today I have resigned from my duties as President of ESPN,” Skipper said in a statement. “I have struggled for many years with a substance addiction,” he added. “I have decided that the most important thing I can do right now is to take care of my problem. “I come to this public disclosure with embarrassment, trepidation and a feeling of having let others I care about down. “To my colleagues at ESPN, it has been a privilege. I take great pride in your accomplishments and have complete confidence in your collective ability to continue ESPN’s success.” The move seems to have caught ESPN employees off guard. “Nobody knows anything,” an unidentified ESPN staffer told Sports Illustrated reporter Richard Deitsch. “There is a lot of reckless speculation out there.” Skipper had held the position since 2012 and earlier this year signed an extension to stay with the network through 2021. The network has struggled financially of late. In April, it laid off 100 employees, many of whom were well-known names among ESPN’s on-air talent. It’s also struggled to navigate the increasingly more political aspects of sports, taking on criticism in October when it temporarily suspended “SportsCenter” host Jemele Hill after she shared her political opinions on social media. Hill took to Twitter Monday to express her admiration for Skipper and thank him for his support. This story has been updated with additional details about the network.",BUSINESS,SPORTS
Cambridge Analytica Is Shutting Down After Facebook Controversy,"Embattled political research firm Cambridge Analytica is closing all of its operations with plans to file for bankruptcy in the U.S., it announced on Wednesday. The London-based company, which was hired by President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, was outed in March as having harvested personal data on millions of Facebook users, without their knowledge, for marketing and political purposes. In a statement on its website, the firm said it has been the subject of “numerous unfounded accusations” and “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.” The decision to close up shop followed rising legal fees and a loss of clients over the investigation into their work and use of Facebook data, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the situation. Shortly after the scandal broke, the firm announced an independent investigation into its practices. The results of that investigation, which were shared on the company’s website this week, stated that the allegations against the firm were not “borne out by the facts.” The firm also suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, in March after he was recorded bragging about Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, influencing more than 200 elections around the world with unethical practices. Those methods included bribery, entrapment and the use of sex workers and inaccurate information. Nix had said that he was lying when he said that.  Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The founders and funders of Cambridge Analytica registered a new company in London last August called Emerdata Limited, according to business filings reported on in March. Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer ― whose billionaire father Robert Mercer funded Cambridge Analytica as well as SCL Group and Trump’s election campaign ― were listed as directors of the company. Nix and SCL Group Chairman Julian Wheatland were named among Emerdata’s directors.

"Drone Captures Unbelievable Video, Adds Entirely New Dimension To Whale Watching","Fin whales -- the second-largest whale species and also one of the most elusive -- are longer than the average school bus.  Given their size and deep-diving behavior, encountering one of these behemoths in the wild is quite the treat for any scientist, tourist or kayaker. But one California-based whale watching company, Dana Wharf Whale Watching, is adding an entirely new dimension to their tour: drones. The Dana Wharf Copter Cam captured this breathtaking aerial footage of a fin whale gliding through the Pacific Ocean, and it gives an entirely new perspective on what being larger than a school bus really means.  Because fin whales are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and are also protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, many are questioning whether drones pose a risk to whales. NOAA requires that boats to stay 100 yards from whales, and that airplanes and helicopters stay at least 1,000 feet above whales, but there it's unclear as to whether these restrictions apply to drones, according to the International Business Times. The National Marine Fisheries Service will be discussing drone use around marine mammals in upcoming meetings, according to GrindTV.  Fin whales are the second-largest whale species and the most common ones to be hit by vessels, according to NOAA. They inhabit all of the world's oceans in deep, offshore areas and live for 80 to 90 years. ",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT

Disney And Oil Industry Team Up For 'Rocking In Ohio' Event [UPDATED],"Radio Disney, ""home of the hottest kids' music,"" is teaming up with Ohio's oil and gas industry to teach school kids that pipelines are awesome.  ""Rocking In Ohio"" is an interactive, game show-like presentation entirely funded by the Ohio Oil and Gas Association and presented jointly with Radio Disney. This ""special partnership,"" as they call it, ""highlights the importance of Ohio’s oil and gas industry, and why science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) are crucial in developing energy resources in Ohio,"" according to the association. Hosted by a master of ceremonies and three staffers from Cleveland's Radio Disney affiliate WWMK, the hour-long event challenges kids, families and dads to head-to-head games that explain the science behind resource extraction and tout the benefits of products made from fossil fuels. Children run, dance and answer questions, and are given prizes from Disney movies and the Radio Disney brand. Radio Disney broadcasts online and in more than 35 markets and positions itself as ""the unrivaled broadcast radio network for kids and families."" Nielsen ranks Cleveland as the nation's 31st-largest radio market. Disney representatives did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication. The traveling show is part of an industry-funded outreach program called the Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program (OOGEEP), which partners industry representatives with science teachers in the state. ""Rocking In Ohio"" was performed at the Ohio State Fair in August, and since then the show has made at least 26 stops at county fairs, science centers and schools. The show features a pipeline-building competition for children. At a stop at the Wayne County Fair in September, Radio Disney emcee ""Jag"" told kids they would be ""literally creating our own pipeline,"" to show ""how we get oil and gas to your home,"" reported the Wooster Daily Record. ""Cheer these guys on like crazy,"" Jag said, as students pushed pingpong balls through their pipelines. “We want kids to get excited about science,” OOGEEEP executive director Rhonda Reda told the Newark Advocate. “It allows science to be fun. Who better to help than Radio Disney?”  Reda said that if this fall's pilot program is successful, it will be rolled out throughout Ohio in 2014. Environmental activists are less enthusiastic about the partnership. ""Disney should be warm and fuzzy and dreamland, not promoting oil and gas. That’s just wrong,"" Teresa Mills, an activist and staffer at the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, recently told the Akron Beacon Journal. ""It's about brainwashing our children."" Among the show's stops was a visit to Youngstown's OH WOW!, a children's science and technology center that opened in 2011. Youngstown previously saw a whole year of ""rocking in Ohio"" as the city was struck by 167 earthquakes between January 2011 and February 2012. A recent study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research concluded the quakes were linked to an injection well that was used for disposing of the wastewater from oil and gas operations. No earthquakes had been recorded in Youngstown between the late 18th century and 2010, and the tremors have stopped since the well was shut down. Below, the ""Rocking in Ohio"" crew performing at the Ohio State Fair in Columbus on Aug. 2, 2013: UPDATE Jan. 9: Following a petition from activist organization Climate Parents that has garnered over 80,000 signatures and a #DisneyFracked Twitter campaign from the Sierra Club, Disney has announced it is ending its partnership with Ohio's oil and gas industry.  ""The sole intent of the collaboration between Radio Disney and the nonprofit Rocking in Ohio educational initiative was to foster kids’ interest in science and technology,"" a Radio Disney spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Huffington Post. ""Having been inadvertently drawn into a debate that has no connection with this goal, Radio Disney has decided to withdraw from the few remaining installments of the program.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT

Move The Starting Line: COO Knows Diverse Teams Yield Creativity,"Yes, she knows it sounds odd coming from someone with an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and a masters degree from Harvard Business School. But, Peggy Yu, COO of  Startup Institute, says sometimes the best employees are non-traditional ones. “There is no way to get the most creative ideas and the best solutions from people with the same backgrounds,” says Yu, who after 10 years in transportation, logistics, media and software, moved into her current work she calls “transformational.” Startup Institute, a Boston-based program with 1,400 alumni, offers four tracks “to help you leverage your passions and build the technical skills, culture skills, and network that will launch you into the innovation industry in the areas of Web Development, Web Design, Digital Marketing, or Sales and Business Development,” according to the website. Full time eight-week programs, and part-time 12-week programs are accessible through scholarships. According to Yu, Startup Institute students are trained with skills that can be used to start companies or be part of innovation teams at existing companies. While startup ventures are sprinkled throughout the country, nine out of 10 start-ups backed by venture capitalists are in California, according to PitchBook. “This lack of geographic diversity isn't surprising, but it does mean the other 40-plus states and regions don't get a lot of attention from the tech community,” Dana Olsen writes. The overall picture of the U.S. startup landscape is healthy, according to TechCrunch, as the third quarter of 2017 demonstrates, with new results just released. “Data shows a rise in late-stage funding and a stabilizing early-stage funding environment. At the late stage, U.S. venture investment hit its highest level in five quarters by both round count and total dollars invested. Total investment at the early stage was also at the highest point in the past year,” writes Joanna Glasner. In the third quarter of 2017, there were 791 early-stage startups launched, backed by $8.26 billion in investments, according to Tech Crunch. A total of 225 late stage startups received $11.61 billion in funding. “Overall, venture funding for Q3 of 2017 totaled $21.75 billion, according to Crunchbase projections,” Olsen writes. With this robust landscape for innovation funding, lowering the barriers to entry for everyone is essential. There is enough to go around for everyone. “We want to give people the opportunity to have access,” Yu says, to the innovation dollars and opportunities. Because the playing field is not level and the starting line keeps moving for those who are not well-connected to networks. “The upskilling of labor is a big problem,” she says. “Those who are fortunate to have access to resources can move around.” Others, however, cannot. To fix that accessibility gap, Yu says, “Startup makes it accessible, and gives technical skills, soft skills, a network and an ecosystem of companies.”  And that accessibility is then available for non-traditional tech employees, including women, veterans, non-college grads and many more. Yu’s own route to leading Startup Institute began in a traditional way, but diverged because “I realized if I was going to work that hard, I wanted skin in the game. I knew more of what I don’t want than what I want,” Yu says. After graduating from Northwestern in 2002, Yu worked in sales management for a year, moved to operations, then moved into logistics for a Boston-based transportation company. She traveled and worked internationally in Singapore, Hong Kong and throughout China. Deciding to move out of transportation, Yu went to Harvard Business School starting in 2005, finishing in 2007. “It was a humbling experience, as I was one of the youngest there. And it was very transformational,” Yu says. One of her professors introduced her to a later stage startup after graduation and while there, she says she “realized my love for B2B, and went to San Francisco in 2008, working at a large company with pockets of innovation building out alternative business models.” While at that company, she was an advocate for hiring employees with nontraditional backgrounds, specifically candidates who did not have her brand of educational pedigree, or a degree at all. “A lot of companies want to see if you graduated from college,” Yu says. “But I care about how hungry and curious they are. I want to know that you are willing to learn.” Yu says she had to strongly fight for a candidate who was not a college graduate, and got pushback from human resources. “I had one candidate who was fantastic, she was a star, and she had the personality and the perspective.” Yu hired her and she became a stellar employee. In 2012, Yu returned to Harvard for her five-year reunion, and after conversations with her former professors, began working at the Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship at HBS. She left that position in August 2015 to try and decide her next career move. Now back in the Boston area, she became a volunteer mentor for students, then worked as a mentor in residence. And now is Yu is COO. With sights set on the future with diversity in the startup universe, Yu says her goal is to have “companies to sponsor a sales track, for instance, and give opportunities to students and pay for trainings.” Yu acknowledges that is is “hard to build trust on diverse teams,” but says ultimately it is worth it—for the best ideas, the best workplace cultures, and of course, for fairness. Stagnation on diversity in innovation is unnecessary, she says. And what does Yu think about a company culture that does not provide access to all? “That drives me bananas.” This post originally ran in Take The Lead. ",BUSINESS,TECH

Your Birthday May Play A Role In Whether You Suffer From Allergies,"Scientists have long noticed a strange correlation between when we're born and how likely it is that we'll experience certain health problems, including allergies.   Thanks to an international team of researchers, we now can at least partly explain how this happens: The season you were born in can leave certain ""markers"" on your DNA that may influence your health, said Dr. John Holloway, professor of allergy and respiratory genetics at the University of Southampton in England and a co-author of the new study. ""If we can go on to identify what it is about season of birth that causes these changes, this could potentially be modifiable, allowing the development of preventative strategies for allergies,"" he told The Huffington Post. For the study, which was published in the journal Allergy on Tuesday, researchers scanned DNA samples from 367 18-year-olds who were born on the Isle of Wight in England. They analyzed specific markers, called DNA methylation, in the samples, and examined whether different markers could be associated with what time of year a person was born and whether they suffer from any allergic diseases, including asthma and eczema. The researchers then measured how susceptible each person was to developing such allergies and noted which participants reported suffering from hay fever, asthma or eczema when they were 1, 4, 10, and 18 years old, Live Science reported. It turns out that we carry certain DNA markers into adulthood -- and that some are both associated with the season we're born in and whether it's likely we'll develop certain allergies.  For example, the researchers linked being born in the fall with an increased risk of eczema. Children born in autumn or winter may have a higher chance of developing asthma, The Telegraph reported. Similar findings emerged when the researchers looked at markers found in a group of 8-year-olds. However, the researchers didn't see the markers when they tested their findings in a group of newborn babies -- which suggests that DNA methylation changes might be a result of a person's environment and not occur while in the womb. ""It might sound like a horoscope by the seasons, but now we have scientific evidence for how that horoscope could work,"" Dr. Gabrielle Lockett, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southampton and first author of the study, said in a statement. ""Because season of birth influences so many things, the epigenetic marks discovered in this study could also potentially be the mechanism for other seasonally influenced diseases and traits too, not just allergy."" Last year, for instance, data scientists at Columbia University Medical Center in New York discovered an odd correlation between the month a person was born and their risk of developing not only allergies but also health problems including heart disease, viral infections and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous studies have also linked season of birth with the risk of some food allergies. More research is needed to explore these associations, as Holloway said it's unclear why they exist. ""It could be, for example, sunlight levels affecting maternal vitamin D levels either when the baby is in utero or in breastmilk after birth. It could be a postnatal effect determined by season of birth -- such as, does the child encounter it’s first winter cold season shortly after birth or after nine months when its immune system is more mature,"" he said. ""Is it something to do with mother’s diet as the nutrient content of our diets have been shown to vary with the season? ... We don’t know, but this is what we hope to go on to find out.""",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"Pluto May Have Underground Ocean, Evidence Suggests","HOUSTON - Scientists have found evidence that tiny, distant Pluto harbors a hidden ocean beneath the frozen surface of its heart-shaped central plain containing as much water as all of Earth’s seas. The finding, reported on Wednesday in two research papers published in the journal Nature, adds Pluto to a growing list of worlds in the solar system beyond Earth believed to have underground oceans, some of which potentially could be habitats for life. Pluto’s ocean, which is likely slushy with ice, lies 93 to 124 miles (150 to 200 km) beneath the dwarf planet’s icy surface and is about 62 miles (100 km) deep, planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California, Santa Cruz said in an interview. With its ocean covered by so much ice, Pluto is not a prime candidate for life, added Massachusetts Institute of Technology planetary scientist Richard Binzel, another of the researchers. But Binzel added that “one is careful to never say the word impossible.” Liquid water is considered one of the essential ingredients for life. The discovery was made through an analysis of images and data collected by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto and its entourage of moons in July 2015. “It shows that nature is more creative than we are able to imagine, which is why we go and explore,” Binzel said. “We see what nature is capable of doing.” Despite being about 40 times farther from the sun than Earth, Pluto has enough radioactive heat left over from its formation 4.6 billion years ago to keep water liquid. “Pluto has enough rock that there’s quite a lot of heat being generated, and an ice shell a few hundred kilometers thick is quite a good insulator,” Nimmo said. “So a deep subsurface ocean is not too surprising, especially if the ocean contains ammonia, which acts like an antifreeze.” Scientists made the discovery as they were trying to figure out why a 621-mile (1,000-km) wide impact basin known as Sputnik Planitia, which contains the curious heart-shaped region, was located in its present position near Pluto’s equator. Computer models showed the basin likely filled with ice, which caused Pluto to roll over, cracking its crust. That could happen only if Pluto possessed a subsurface ocean, the analysis found. New Horizons is on its way to another frozen world in the Kuiper Belt region of the solar system about 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km) past Pluto. A flyby of the object, known as 2014 MU69, is scheduled on Jan. 1, 2019. (Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Will Dunham)",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"Bear Breaks Into Home In Russia, Eats Borscht Soup Before Residents Call Police (PHOTOS)","Who knew bears like borscht?  Apparently, that's what one hungry intruder was in the mood for early Saturday when the bear broke into a house in Russia to enjoy some freshly made beetroot soup. Residents of the home, who were resting in the outdoor sauna at the time, called for help when they heard loud noises and saw the animal rifling around the covered porch. As RIA Novosti notes, the couple called the manager of the community who then notified police around 1 a.m.  Local authorities in the Irkutsk Oblast region arrived at the house and scared the bear off by firing a shot into the air. The animal reportedly scampered off into the woods, but not before it had inflicted a fair amount of damage to the property.  The borscht-eating bear most likely smelled the soup, which was cooling on the kitchen stovetop, from the woods and broke a window to enter the home.   According to a statement released by Ust-Ilimsk police, which included photos of the scene, this is not the first time a bear has ventured onto properties in the area in search of food. Police recommend that residents be cautious with storage of their food supplies.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Farmer John and the Cow-Flop,"John Boehner, it's fair to say, have never been a major player in California water policy, or even in its hyper-political expression, California's water wars. He's served on the House Agriculture Committee, and boasts of the agricultural richness of his Ohio Congressional District. But he was perfectly willing, at the end of  2013, to let the House go home without passing the Farm Bill: ""The Speaker was adamant that the House would not stay in session past Dec. 13 to finish work on the legislation. 'I've made it clear that the House is going to leave next Friday,' Boehner said. 'You all know me pretty well: I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.'"" And there's nothing on his Congressional website to indicate a profound interest in the welfare of the San Joaquin Delta. So it might have seemed perplexing that he suddenly popped up in Bakersfield a few weeks ago to announce his personal support for legislation to reignite California's water wars by declaring that in a looming drought catastrophe, whether you got water ought to depend on whom your district voted for.  Boehner didn't say as much -- and he might not even admit it -- but the bill he endorsed basically says that Californians who need water to manufacture computers, entice tourists, provide apartment dwellers with showers, catch salmon or grow high value crops like asparagus should get much less in a crisis, and Californians who grow cotton or alfalfa, and live in heavily Republican Congressional districts, should be bailed out.  California is suffering October in January.  The standard greeting this month when you meet a friend is ""Do you like the (70 degrees and sunny) weather?"" ""No, it petrifies me."" 2013 was the driest year since water records began. Governor Brown reluctantly declared a state emergency, calling the obvious drought -- a drought.  Already the damage is mounting.  Ski resorts have close to zero snow. Crops are blossoming too early, vulnerable to frosts. Reservoirs are bathtub rings.  Along the California coast, the Coho Salmon have gathered, waiting for the pulse of winter rains that leads them up their home streams to spawn. Without rains, biologists suspect that 
the entire species south of the Golden Gate may go extinct --  hundreds of fish runs wiped out in a single year. You don't need to fall back on global warming as an explanation -- the tree-ring records strongly suggest that the twentieth century climate of California was a wetter than normal anomaly.  Brown did the right thing declaring a drought.  But his ongoing water proposals do far too little to deal with the state's three water truths:  California depletes more groundwater than it restores, has allocated more water than it will have, and wastes more than its economy can withstand. Instead of solving these problems, Brown has focused on refighting a battle he lost in his first tenure in Sacramento: to resolve the gnarly problem of how to best transport water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for delivery further South.  Brown's solution -- tunnels -- are expensive and unpopular. Just like his 1970's foray, the Peripheral Canal, the Governor's new proposal fails to recognize that California has a water allocation and a water waste problem that must be solved before it can rationally plan water distribution.  There is no agreement on how much water his tunnels should carry or where it should end up -- which makes it impossible to achieve consensus on how they should be designed or operated.  The drought could give him a chance to be bolder, and potentially more successful. One of the things you look for in a drought is a way to bring people together to share, and overcome, the reality that there is not enough water for anyone's historic expectations. That's what makes Farmer John's Boehner's intervention -- now embodied in House legislation -- so unhelpful. Boehner's speech had not a single word of concern for California's fishing communities, or for the vegetable growers of the Delta, the electronics manufacturers in Silicon Valley, the ski operators of the Sierra Nevada or the cattlemen of the northern coastal valleys. By over-promising deliveries to water wasting agriculture, Boehner's proposal even threatens the remaining Republican suburban base in Southern California with more severe rationing. Boehner has no doubt been told this, but he chose to inject himself in Bakersfield like a city slicker in fancy shoes crossing a cow pasture.  Here's a reason that makes logic of this -- if a peculiar DC style of logic.  Boehner intends to be more cooperative in resolving issues like the Debt Ceiling and the Farm Bill than Tea Party members of his caucus like. Rural Representatives like Devin Nunes are his potential allies in this fight.  Boehner knows that his all-the-water-for-cotton bill is not going to end up on the President's desk -- it's a message, not a serious legislative ploy. Efforts by California Republicans to insert their provisions into the Farm Bill were rebuffed even in the House. So without really doing anything, he can show he's a hard liner on an issue that rural Californians in his caucus care intensely about. As Congressman George Miller, who has led the Northern California team at  water negotiating tables for decades, commented, Boehner's proposal "" has little or nothing to do with water policy in the state"" and everything to do with the politics of the Republican caucus.  (Miller is retiring.)  Miller fears that the effort will ""pull the pin on the grenade"" and make it impossible for the state to come together to deal with both the immediate drought and the longer term water challenge -- let's hope that Boehner merely messes up his Don Draper pants and shoes with the classic risk from venturing into unknown pastures -- the cow flop.

Cowabunga! Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa Breaks World Record Surfing 80-Foot Wave,"Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa has broken a world record by riding the biggest wave ever surfed, according to the World Surf League. Koxa mastered the monster 80-footer off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal, in November. His record-breaking feat only became official Saturday, when it was recognized with the Quiksilver XXL Biggest Wave Award at a World Surf League ceremony in Los Angeles. “The award goes to the surfer who, by any means available, catches the biggest wave of the year,” the league said in a statement. “Not only did Koxa win this year’s honor, but he now holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest wave surfed.” New Guinness World Record: Biggest Wave Ever Surfed (80 Feet) Rodrigo Koxa @ Nazaré, Portugal https://t.co/9zzcRsXnPm pic.twitter.com/A58c7PxYcJ The previous record was set in 2011 by Garrett McNamara, who rode a 78-foot wave, also at Nazaré, authenticated by the Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards judging committee, and confirmed by Guinness. Here’s his ride: Other surfers — including McNamara — have claimed they broke the 2011 record, but Koxa’s ride is the only one that has been confirmed by the WSL and Guinness records. “I got a present from God,” Koxa told The Inertia online surf news site after the awards ceremony. “It was the best present I’ve ever had.” Koxa said he almost was killed in 2014 at Nazaré, where many of the world’s biggest surfing waves are.  “For months later, I had bad dreams, I didn’t travel, I got scared, and my wife helped me psychologically,” he said. “Now, I’m just so happy.” Among other honors handed out Saturday, the award for Wipeout of the Year went to British surfer Andrew Cotton, who broke his back in a horrific fall at Nazaré. He’s still recovering and plans to return soon to surfing, the WSL statement said. Congratulations @andrew_cotton, #BigWaveAwards Wipeout of the Year winner!

Twitter Pledges To Fix Its Most Annoying Features,"Big changes are coming to Twitter. Many basic features on the popular social media service will be completely overhauled in the coming months, the company announced in a blog post Tuesday. The changes will make Twitter easier to use but potentially ratchet up noise levels on the already cacophonous platform. Twitter, which famously enforces a 140-character limit on tweets, will ease up on various restrictions. User handles and visual media like photos, videos and GIFs will no longer count toward the character count. People will now be able to retweet themselves, in case they want a message to get more visibility down the line. And, if your tweet starts with another user's handle, it will be broadcast to everyone who follows you -- like any other tweet. Currently, starting a tweet with another user's name means that tweet will only appear to people who follow you and the other person -- as a workaround, people append a period to the start of user names if they want everyone to see it. The move marks some of the biggest changes made by CEO Jack Dorsey since he returned in October to the company he co-founded. He arrived at a particularly tumultuous time. By the end of last year, the social network failed to add any new users, who are key to charging higher rates for advertising on the platform.  The company rolled out some swift changes, such as a new section called Moments, meant to make consuming news easier for users who may find the platform difficult to navigate. That, coupled with its first serious advertising campaign, may have somewhat reversed its fortunes. During its first-quarter earnings call last month, Twitter reported better-than-expected user growth -- but revenue missed estimates, and the stock price, already on a precipitous decline over the last year, plummeted 12 percent.  It's difficult to say what impact the updates will have. In a sense, they'll make Twitter a more intuitive platform for newcomers: The strange arcana that go into determining character counts will be washed away, after all, leaving individuals with a full 140 keystrokes to say whatever they want. But the expansion of retweets and elimination of targeted ""@"" replies will make the platform noisier -- unless it more fully embraces an algorithm that shows users content that Twitter automatically determines to be relevant. A noisier Twitter will no doubt continue to enable harassment, a major problem on the social network. The company said this is just the start, and that more changes will be coming. ""We’re exploring ways to make existing uses easier and enable new ones, all without compromising the unique brevity and speed that make Twitter the best place for live commentary, connections, and conversations,"" Todd Sherman, Twitter's senior project manager, wrote in the blog post announcing the update.",TECH,TECH

Farmer John Doubles Down,"I don't usually do sequels to blogs, but events have moved rapidly since my first blog on Speaker John Boehner's injecting himself into California water policy. For one thing, it's raining here, so the worst drought in the state's history may become just a severe drought. And Californians are behaving like rural villagers in India, welcoming rain not as bad weather but as a blessing, and gray as the color not of tears but of happiness. But that hasn't stopped Boehner from summoning his caucus to pass the astonishingly bold-faced water grab by San Joaquin Valley Republicans which would massively redistribute the state's water in the favor of Republican farming districts to the disadvantage of the (largely Democratic) rest of the state. The House passed the bill Wednesday on a party line vote, 229-191. In theory of course, House Republicans want to keep the federal government from intruding into the proper realm of states -- that's their core guiding principal, we are told. But this bill, which is opposed by a wide swathe of Western governors, overrides state law in a number of critical areas, and undoes the historic understandings of which water users are entitled to priority in a drought.  It's about as big a federal power grab as you can conceive of -- and has been scathingly denounced by House Democrats from agricultural districts that would lose water, like John Garamendi as ""a theft of water from someone to give to somebody else, plain and simple."" Imagine that in their final terms in Congress, Henry Waxman and George Miller were to introduce federal legislation pre-empting California water law and requiring the state to end the overdraft of groundwater reserves, on the valid grounds that is seriously threatening the long term viability of the entire U.S. economy -- because California is such a large part of what drives prosperity for the whole country. ""A yell to rend the firmament"" would explode from conservative circles in Washington at this egregious Congressional water-theft and power grab. This bill is not going to pass -- the House put it through once before, and it died in the Senate. The White House has already threatened a veto.  But the question it raises is why is no one in the media calling Boehner on his hypocrisy? Here is a Speaker who dithered for three years to get a national farm bill on the House calendar, now says he won't be able to get immigration reform done in 2014, but he can ramrod through a piece of legislation that violates every principal he and his caucus stand for -- except partisan payoffs. It certainly looks like the national political media have internalized the fact that the House Republicans play by their own set of rules, and therefore shouldn't -- unlike Chris Christie, or the Democrats -- be held accountable for blatant thuggery.   Boehner thinks this move will help his caucus in San Joaquin Valley districts in 2014, and he may well be right.  But longer term, he is driving even more deeply into the California political landscape the identification of the Republican party with a narrow set of economic interests -- the least fertile, most heavily subsidy dependent farmers and the oil industry.

Some Prosecutors Are Erasing Old Weed Convictions. Why Isn't Yours?,"LOS ANGELES ― Millions of Americans have marijuana-related convictions on their criminal records — marks that can impair their ability to obtain jobs, housing and loans. But most Americans now believe pot should be legal, and about a quarter of Americans live in jurisdictions where it is. In some legal-weed states, legislators are passing bold new laws to address those past pot crimes. And some prosecutors are finally taking notice — and are looking to roll back outdated convictions.  In California, prosecutors in San Francisco and San Diego counties announced earlier this year they will review, recall, resentence and potentially dismiss and seal thousands of misdemeanor and felony marijuana convictions. The movement is spreading. On Friday, Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes became the latest top prosecutor to join, asking a city court to vacate all convictions and dismiss all charges for misdemeanor marijuana possession that were prosecuted in the city before the state legalized marijuana for recreational purposes in 2012.  Now prosecutors in Denver and Burlington, Vt., are mulling similar measures, their representatives told HuffPost this week. In Denver, where prosecution of low-level pot offenses has been a low priority for a decade, Ken Lane, a spokesman for newly elected DA Beth McCann, said that while McCann hasn’t retroactively applied Colorado’s laws for post-conviction relief, “she has asked staff to research the matter... in response to what DAs in California are doing.” And in Vermont, which recently became the first state in the nation to legalize marijuana via legislature rather than ballot measure, another prosecutor is making moves. Justin Jiron, deputy state’s attorney in Chittenden County, Vermont, which contains Burlington, told HuffPost that his office is weeks away from announcing a new policy that will allow individuals to apply to have their past marijuana possession records expunged or sealed regardless of when the conviction took place. It’s not as immediate of a review as San Franciscans and San Diegans can expect, but it’s a meaningful step. “I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.”  Prosecutors in pot-friendly jurisdictions have enormous power to offer relief for people previously convicted of marijuana offenses in their jurisdiction, but many aren’t using it. California’s marijuana law requires individuals to apply for relief for previous marijuana-related crimes — a process that can be costly and time-consuming. Prosecutors there could greatly speed up the process by following San Francisco’s automatic process, which makes relief more immediate. Prosecutors in other legal-weed jurisdictions could potentially follow Seattle prosecutor Holmes’ lead and leverage their own state’s laws to move for post-conviction relief for past marijuana offenses. Those state laws, however, are complex and vary tremendously by jurisdiction ― this includes expungement, which does not have a standard definition across jurisdictions, as well as sealing and dismissal. Some states don’t address retroactive relief for past criminal convictions. Some require a governor’s pardon to vacate a conviction. Others allow post-conviction relief but require years-long wait periods, or limit which kinds of convictions can be removed from a person’s record.   But few prosecutors are making moves like Holmes’ — either because they don’t want to, or because state legislatures haven’t passed laws that allow relief for now-legal acts. People convicted of state pot crimes in the past in Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Alaska, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine — all places where the drug is now legal for recreational purposes — may still have violations on their record. And even in California, where the legal marijuana industry is already valued at $7 billion, according to one estimate. In Los Angeles County, California’s largest by population, District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced in February that individuals will have to continue to apply for relief themselves, “rather than wait for [her] office to go through tens of thousands of case files.” Lacey estimated there were 40,000 felony convictions involving marijuana since 1993 in Los Angeles County. When reached by HuffPost, her office did not have any updates on this decision. Prosecutors’ and legislators’ failure to wipe now-legal pot crimes from Americans’ records has real consequences, especially for people of color. Drug convictions, even for a misdemeanor offense like possession of marijuana, can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed. The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. “Laws and public opinion are evolving, but past convictions for marijuana-related offenses can still haunt someone,” said Mason Tvert, who works with VS Strategies, a Denver-based communications and government relations firm focused on marijuana policy. “It is great to see officials in some of the states that have legalized marijuana are proactively working to clear people’s records,” said the activist who was instrumental in the passage of Colorado’s recreational marijuana ballot measure. “But it does beg the question of why it is only occurring in some jurisdictions. Hopefully, we will see more local officials following the examples that are being set by the leaders in San Francisco and Seattle.” The exact extent to which prosecutors can retroactively apply their state marijuana laws or seek to vacate past convictions is a point of debate, and it depends on many complicated factors. This includes a prosecutors’ individual preferences, resources, a state’s laws regarding retroactivity and post-conviction relief, said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a former prosecutor who is now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. “There’s no one right answer to this,” Eisen said. “But what’s happening with marijuana in states like California and Colorado, which have built in some of this retroactivity, it does open the door absolutely for a little bit more pushing the envelope by DAs.” Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.  “There’s an argument to be made that a defendant should get the benefit of that doubt,” she said. “Today, many prosecutors are working to repair damage from the war on drugs ... But more can be done.”  Rodney Holcombe, staff attorney at the Drug Policy Alliance echoed this sentiment, saying it is not enough to simply legalize marijuana because prohibition ravaged many communities. “Tens of thousands of people across the country – especially persons of color – continue to suffer from the consequences of prohibition,” he said. “We cannot in good conscience legalize without repairing the harms wrought by the failed drug war. We can only truly claim victory when we center our efforts on the persons most harmed by prohibition.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Electric Car Charger Company, ECOtality, Goes Bankrupt, Stranding 13,000 Docking Stations","From Mother Nature Network's Jim Motavalli: Now here’s a fine mess, as Laurel and Hardy used to say. One of the biggest electric vehicle charging companies, Arizona-based ECOtality (a Nissan Leaf partner), went bankrupt, stranding about 13,000 commercial and residential stations. We all have a stake in this, because American tax dollars supported these installations through the so-called EV Project. In the early rounds, only one bidder emerged, an unknown company called Tellus Power, which proposed acquiring ECOtality's assets for just $3 million. Consider that the federal grants totaled almost $115 million (of which almost $100 million was spent) and you begin to see the issue here. There are clear parallels to what happened to the U.S. investment in Fisker Automotive, which went bankrupt after spending $192 million of a $529 million loan (the feds then seized $21 million in assets). But just as I was writing this, the Florida-based Car Charging Group said that it had won the prize, price unspecified. ""We believe this will solidify our position as the leader in the electric vehicle charging industry,"" said Michael Farkas, the CEO. CCG has been aggressively expansionist, and owns pay-to-charge stations in such places as the parking garages of New York City. He's right; this makes the company a big player. One of the issues with ECOtality's bankruptcy was making sure its network remains active, so users can swipe cards and get billed for the electricity. The worst possible outcome would have been to have ECOtality’s 3,300 public chargers (the rest are residential) inoperable because nobody could turn on their billing and operating systems. Nissan was so concerned about the network that it lent ECOtality $1.25 million to get through the auction, spokesman Brian Brockman confirmed. Come to think of it, if those home units didn’t work, that would have been horrible, too. If you see parallels to the big and still-evolving government shutdown, you’re paying attention. It’s not quite veterans unable to get into war memorials, but it’s along the same lines. Brett Hauser, president of Greenlots (which develops open-standard solutions) and a board member of the Open Charge Alliance, was watching the ECOtality debacle. He thinks it’s a clear argument applying open-source standards to all new installed chargers. That would prevent the embarrassing situation in Hawaii, where proprietary chargers installed by the bankrupt Better Place became “orphaned” because its new owners, OpConnect, couldn’t find the RFID cards to run them. California, on National Plug-In Day, enacted a law requiring all new chargers to be accessible to credit cards — you shouldn’t have to join a network to use them. Forrest North, chief operating officer of Recargo, which runs very popular station locator apps (Recargo and PlugShare), points out, “We’re used to buying things from places like Amazon with just a credit card. These private networks and membership cards have led to nightmarish problems for people who couldn’t get a charge when they needed one.” Recargo actually has its own solution to this, the newly launched Pay With Plugshare (above), which lets you use the iPhone (and Android later this year) app and your credit card to pay for a charge at any participating public station. So far, it has SemaConnect, one of the larger providers, on board. “Our focus is on the driver, trying to make it as easy and seamless as possible,” said North. The Open Charge Alliance, meanwhile, is recruiting internationally (including in Holland, which is very EV-friendly) to get all the EV players give up the idea of proprietary networks. Back to ECOtality. I think Car Charging Group should be a good steward for the company's assets. Internationally, there are much worse scenarios. The aforementioned Better Place left a lot of stranded assets, and so far no credible buyer has emerged for it (though Iceland’s Northern Lights Energy is interested). Tellus Power is a big question mark. The company is based in California, but very low profile there—it’s a subsidiary of a Chinese company called Tusai Holding. A division, Asola, made solar modules for the Fisker Karma, but that didn’t work out so well. Tellus has a website here, but it’s content-free so far. The U.S. government closely scrutinized some potential sales of Fisker (also to Chinese interests), but I didn't see any similar uproar here. Hauser says his Greenlots company has “taken a look at the ECOtality operation. We want to make sure those stations stay up and are used.” He added, “Our perspective is that, whoever wins, they should continue to have connected stations and make them open source. It’s the only way for the electric car adoption to thrive and prosper.” Here's some pre-bankruptcy video that gives you a fuller ECOtality picture:",ENVIRONMENT,BUSINESS
Longtime Trump Lawyer Slams Giuliani As 'Polarizing Figure' Who Shouldn't Deal With Mueller,"Jay Goldberg, the attorney who represented President Donald Trump for almost two decades, doesn’t think Rudy Giuliani is fit to be handling the legal team tasked with handling special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Not only is Giuliani not sufficiently experienced, Goldberg said, but he also may be in it for his own gain.   “I think he’s a polarizing figure,” Goldberg said of the former New York City mayor on MSNBC’s “The Beat With Ari Melber” on Tuesday. “There are those people who think he was a wonderful prosecutor but he has no record managing a defense of someone who’s accused of wrongdoing. I told him that I didn’t think that Giuliani was the right person for him to select. I thought there were much better people that he could use in terms of negotiating with Mueller.” Giuliani is misguided if he thinks he can scare Mueller into winding down the investigation, Goldberg added.

Uber Fires 20 After Harassment Probe,"Uber has fired 20 employees as part of a larger inquiry into harassment claims, the company confirmed to HuffPost. The firings came after an independent law firm completed an investigation into 215 human resources claims, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Of the 215 claims, 100 resulted in no action; 31 required employees to receive additional training; seven prompted written warnings; and 57 are still being investigated. Uber announced the firings at an all-hands on Tuesday, according to The New York Times. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a separate investigation into sexual harassment and discrimination claims at company. Uber board member Arianna Huffington, the former editor-in-chief of HuffPost, is helping oversee Holder’s probe. That investigation has concluded, but has yet to be publicly addressed. In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler detailed her experiences at the company in a revealing blog post, describing what she says was a nightmarish, sexist work environment. Fowler wrote that her superior propositioned her for sex. When she reported the incident to Uber HR, Fowler says her claims were dismissed and she was instructed to either find another team to work for or accept negative performance reviews in the future. The post prompted Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to call for an internal investigation. On Monday, Uber human resources chief Liane Hornsey told USA Today the greatest sources of internal dissatisfaction at the company are pay and pride, not sexual harassment. “[Fowler’s] blog shocked me,” Hornsey said. “But, what did surprise me, was when I did the listening sessions, this didn’t come up as an issue. It wasn’t one of our big themes. Other things came up that are in that area, that our values are masculine and a little aggressive, but the harassment issue, I just didn’t find that at all.” Fowler criticized Hornsey’s findings on Twitter as “more of the same old gaslighting from Uber HR.” The former Uber engineer also used Tuesday’s firings to cast doubt on the company’s ability to scrutinize itself. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Colony Collapse Disorder: It Won't Be Solved With The Banning Of A Single Pesticide,"From TakePart's Willy Blackmore:  Late last month 25,000 bumblebees fell out of the linden trees planted around a Target parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon, all dead. Pesticides were immediately blamed. Despite printed warnings on neonicotinoid-type bug killers stating that they should not be sprayed when bees are present, the flowering lindens were doused with Safari Insecticide, causing what The Xerces Society calls the largest mass death of bumblebees ever recorded in the United States. Just over a month before the bees died in Oregon, the European Union passed a continent-wide ban on neonicotinoids—legislation that environmental groups praised as a significant move to curb Colony Collapse Disorder, the somewhat misleadingly distinct name given to the little-understood deaths of some 10 million hives’ worth of bees in the last six years. Oregon issued a temporary ban on the pesticides too, but nothing as broad as the European law is being considered nationally—and that may not be such a bad thing, because a new study published today in the journal PLOS ONE suggests that CCD is by no means a one-chemical problem. “The pesticide issue in itself is much more complex than we have [been] led to believe,” the study’s lead author, Dennis vanEngelsdorp, tells Quartz. “It’s a lot more complicated than just one product, which means of course the solution does not lie in just banning one class of product.” The research conducted by scientists at the University of Maryland and the USDA looked at the pollen honey bees brought back after pollinating a diverse group of crops: almonds, apples, blueberries, cranberries, cucumber, watermelon and pumpkins. While neonicotinoids were detected in the study, they only showed up in the pollen collected from the apple orchard. But that’s not to say that agirucltural chemicals weren’t making their way back to the hive: “We detected 35 different pesticides in the sampled pollen, and found high fungicide loads,” the study reads. It has previously been believed that fungicides did not pose a risk to honey bees—Quartz notes that they do not bear the same warming labels about spraying them around pollinators as insecticides do—but the Maryland and USDA scientists “found an increased probability” of bees being infected by the gut pathogen Nosema ceranae when exposed to high levels of fungicides. The fungal disease can “adversely affect honey bee colony health, and can result in complete colony collapse.” If the U.S. had banned neonicotinoids along with the E.U., there might be 25,000 more bumblebees in Oregon. But outlawing a single class of pesticides won’t solve CCD. The PLUS ONE study hasn’t identified any smoking gun either, but by offering proof that the problem is exceedingly complex, it may help engender a more nuanced, effective solution.",ENVIRONMENT,SCIENCE
Volcanic Ash And Ancient Poop Reveal Penguins' Tragic History,"By Kendra Pierre-Louis It should be said that Stephen Roberts, a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey, and his colleagues from several European universities — Germany’s Bremen University, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and Cardiff University, among others — did not set out to solve a mystery. Or at least, not one about the largest colonies of Gentoo penguins in Antarctica. But a new study released today in the journal Nature Communications suggests that they stumbled upon a real caper. Roberts and company went to Antarctica to collect lake bed sediments, which give us regional insights into the historical impacts of climate change. “We know the broader scale picture of past climate change, say the last 10 or 12,000 years on a global basis, based on a lot of the ice core records,” said Roberts. “But a lot of the impacts that might happen in certain places are kind of regional changes. Because we have a lot more lakes than ice sheets in a lot of areas, we’re able to reconstruct the temperatures from a lot more places with techniques such as this.” While analyzing lake sediments from Antarctica’s Ardley Island, they stumbled upon an unexpected bounty: penguin bones. “The original purpose of the study wasn’t to go there to find the history of the penguin colony on Ardley Island, it was for relative sea level change,” said Roberts. “But having found the bones and having found some very disparate patterns of geochemistry in the core sample, we thought it’d be an interesting thing to investigate a bit further.” cientists had known for a while that Gentoo penguins, which have lived on Ardley Island for 6,700 years, have periodically experienced sharp population declines. Gentoo penguins, which currently number around 5,000 pairs on Ardley Island, are identifiable from other penguins by a white patch on their black feathers that begins behind their eye and wraps around, connecting behind the crown. Similarly, while other Antarctic penguins like the Adélie spend much of their time on frozen pieces of Antarctic sea ice, the Gentoo penguins—which are the northernmost Antarctic penguins—spend much of their time on dry land. Historical records show that the Gentoo population has declined precipitously five times over the past 6,700 years. But not all of the declines were correlated with climate changes and broader environmental effects. The lake sediment provided a much-needed clue. Roughly 62 miles southeast of Ardley Island lies the ominously-named Deception Island — so called because from the outside it looks like a normal island, but slip through a passageway into its interior and you’ll discover that it’s actually a ring. The inner waterway is in fact the flooded caldera of a large, active volcano. The researcher’s geochemical analyses of the lake sediment sample, which included a new kind of biological marking technique to reconstruct the changes through time — and which looked at the varying concentration of guano or penguin poop and volcanic ash — helped uncover a tragic truth: each time Deception Island’s volcano had a sizable eruption, the resulting fallout was enough to almost completely wipe out Ardley Island’s penguin population. “This study reveals the severe impact volcanic eruptions can have on penguins, and just how difficult it can be for a colony to fully recover,” Claire Waluda, a penguin ecologist for the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement. “An eruption can bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash, and whilst the adults can swim away, the chicks may be too young to survive in the freezing waters. Suitable nesting sites can also be buried, and may remain uninhabitable for hundreds of years.” Exactly how the ash disrupts their population, what happens to the penguins, and why it takes between 400 and 800 years for their numbers to rebound are subjects for future research. But the study is a sobering reminder of how seemingly distant events can have catastrophic effects that linger for centuries. And this unfortunate past might not stay buried: the penguin populations wiped out by historical eruptions were about the same size as the one that exists today, and the volcano is still active.

Kushner Family Reportedly Close To Getting Bailout For Flagship Tower,"White House adviser Jared Kushner’s family business has been looking to get out from under the burden of its financially troubled flagship skyscraper for at least as long as most Americans have heard of Kushner. Multiple news reports indicate that help is on the way. Brookfield Properties, a Canada-based real estate company, is reportedly in talks with Kushner Companies to acquire a major stake in the 666 Fifth Avenue property, two real estate executives briefed on the pending deal told The New York Times. Kushner Companies is run by Charles Kushner, who purchased the midtown Manhattan building over a decade ago with his son Jared. In January 2017, Jared Kushner resigned as chief executive of the family business to become an adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald Trump. He has, however, retained a significant stake in the company. Roughly a year, two potential deals involving 666 Fifth Avenue fell through ― with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company, and with Qatari billionaire Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani ― over concerns about Jared Kushner’s possible conflict of interest between advancing the family business and protecting U.S. interests. Kushner, who advises the president on Middle East policy among other issues, has reportedly been under scrutiny by special counsel Robert Mueller over his alleged efforts to boost the family company with investors in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Russia and China. One of Brookfield’s major investors is the state-owned Qatar Investment Authority, according to the Times. But both Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority denied that the Qatari government was involved in any such transaction with Kushner Companies. “No Qatar-linked entity has any involvement in, investment in or even knowledge of this potential transaction. They are in no way involved,” a Brookfield spokesperson told HuffPost on Thursday. A press representative for the Qatar Investment Authority similarly told HuffPost that it has “no involvement whatsoever in this deal.” The Kushner Companies declined to comment for this story. The Kushners purchased 666 Fifth Avenue at the beginning of 2007, right before the economy crashed, for a whopping $1.8 billion. That price amounted to nearly twice as much, per square foot, as a building in Manhattan had ever sold for, according to The Daily Beast. Within a year, the Kushners were $1.4 billion in debt. The 41-story building has continued to struggle financially, generating only half its annual mortgage payment and remaining roughly 30 percent vacant. If the deal goes through as reported, Brookfield would take over leasing and operations at the skyscraper and embark on major renovations. ",POLITICS,BUSINESS
The Friendship Clause,"Who has experienced a moment in their lives where something happened that forever changed the course of their career?  Like many of you today, I really like to travel. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to travel to most of the continents, many countries and even more cities. But there was one flight in particular that made a significant difference in my journey which transformed my life forever. It all started on an American Airlines flight in 1995. I was traveling with a friend and read an advertisement in the American Way magazine entitled ""Do you want to start your own business?"" My friend and I talked about it for a little bit and asked ourselves what we might do to make a difference in the lives of others. We both had already been employed in the human services field working with the intellectually and developmentally disabled. We agreed that our own communities in Brooklyn, New York were severely underserved when it came to meeting the needs of people with disabilities, especially when those disabled persons were persons of color. So wasting no time right there on the plane, I completed a short application from the magazine, chose a name for our new organization and identified our new mission. I mailed it as soon as I landed at JFK airport in New York.   I was excited that we could start our own “business” and do meaningful work in the world, but I was especially excited about working closely with my dear friend and business partner.  Even though he was 10 years older, we shared a common belief and interest around family, faith, education, careers and making a difference in the community.    In just a matter of months after submitting that application, we began serving the intellectually and developmentally disabled right in our own community. We got off to a terrific start. Apparently, we were right! There was a big need for support services for the disabled within the underserved communities of Brooklyn.  Today, the Not-for-Profit Corporation we founded twenty years ago is known as The Thrive Network and it provides programs and services to over 1,200 individuals and their families with disabilites and employs over 600 people in New York City. Two years into this new enterprise, I served as the Director of Operations while my co-founder served as the Executive Director. We enhanced the quality of life for those with disabilities giving them the opportunity to live with dignity, respect and independence while employing more and more people, developing programs rapidly and influencing the community in ways we never anticipated. Despite my hectic schedule, things were very positive . I tirelessly worked days and went to Brooklyn Law School at night. I graduated from Law School in 2001 and left my job at the agency I founded to become a Kings County Assistant District Attorney. From there, I left that role a short while after to become a lobbyist for the disabled community and the nonprofits who support them. Little did I know, that I would soon face a decision that would force me to choose between my friendship and the “business” my friend and I had started together. It was a predicament that I wouldn’t wish upon anyone.   And then it happened. In 2007, the Board of Directors decided to change the leadership of the organization. We will get to those reason shortly but for now, what matters is that I was recommended to replace my friend, a beloved executive and leader of the organization. A leader that also received success throughout his tenure in the small knit world of executives running organizations and providing services to predominantly minority communities. Without all of the facts to permit me to understand the reasons why my friend was asked to leave, I was guided by a simple objective in deciding what to do.  I was convinced that we could not disappoint those who depend on us for these vital services. If the Board thought I could help and lead the team, I should act accordingly. I was determined to succeed and meet the challenge presented, but with great reservation. My mind raced, filled with anxiety. What would I do? How would I lead the organization? Would I have the support that I needed? How would this ultimately affect our friendship? Is that really even a question? Is being a good leader and being a good friend mutually exclusive and can this co-exist? At first, I didn't even give that question due consideration. I thought nothing could jeopardize so many years of friendship. All I could focus on at the time was the thought that people would be depending on me and I had to do whatever in my power to make sure that the organization would survive, without even taking into account  what that might mean to our friendship.   Here's where my story is the least bit anecdotal. As you are aware, leadership transitions at the executive level occur frequently, even more than we would like to acknowledge. However, when you add the complicating factor of friendship to the mix, such management transitions can become quite problematic instantaneously. At the end of the day, I had to keep in mind that it's a business, not a sensitivity group. Therefore, I have to run it like a business.  How often do leaders get to a point in managing a business that they get momentarily stuck on the issue of people’s feelings, especially when those in question are the founders of the organization? Allow me to offer some advice: Be Comfortable with the Uncomfortable! And more importantly, mind your business and stick to your guns otherwise, no one will take you seriously. When I was first confronted with the choice of trying to protect my friendship or protect the business, I was surprised at how little thought I had given it previously. Like many of you, I had heard some of the stories of famous partings like Steve Jobs from Apple and Michael Ovitz from Disney, but I never contemplated what would happen when it was my friend and my organization. As such,  I had to search the internet to refresh my recollection of valuable lessons I might've missed from Apple or Disney.    You may recall that in 1985, just one year after introducing the Macintosh PC, Steve Jobs was asked to leave Apple by the Board of Directors, by the  CEO he had hand-picked, but with whom he argued with over direction and culture.  He had been forced out of the very company he had built. The Board took a position that the well-being of the business trumps an overall relationship with a founder. Then, in one of corporate history's greatest twists of fate, twelve years later, the Apple Board used the same criteria to bring him back to take advantage of his vision and creative expertise even if it meant there would be no change in his personal style. And as we all know, the rest is history.   Less than a decade later,   Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, hired his friend Michael Ovitz to help him run the company. It took Eisner a little more than a year to decide that his friend simply didn't work out as planned at which point he paid him $140 million to leave, only to be sued by shareholders. In consequence, the Board alleged he had breached his fiduciary duties. Once again, the Board of Directors and Executive Leadership had to focus on business and looked beyond personality conflicts. In each case, the Board of Directors had to recognize that the governance of large organizations sometimes gets messy and even though lines may blur. When it comes to doing business with friends, the bottom line is that the company needs to be run like a business. Period!   In business, we consider several types of clauses but perhaps we are overlooking the most important clause – The Friendship Clause. My own story differs considerably from these now famous stories of terminated executives. For one thing, I did not terminate my friend nor was I responsible for his termination.    Despite many years of doing a lot of good things for so many people, his personal shortcomings and the loss of trust, compromised his ability to lead the organization he loved so dearly.    Unfortunately for me, I was never free to discuss the circumstances that warranted his separation from the organization. Whether my silence or discretion in that regard was perceived as disloyal to him or indifferent, was and still is beyond my control. I was never at liberty to address his issues and had a duty of loyalty to the organization I was trying to stabilize.    Such discretion on my part was not without cost. My perceived indifference cost me my relationships with friends, my own family, our vendors and staff that were largely unaware of what had gone wrong but deeply wounded by the loss of their leader.   I had to make a choice to choose the greater good and honor my duty of loyalty to the organization. In the nine years since I was asked to lead, I have come to realize my co-founder was the best friend I never really knew. I have not reached out to him since I accepted the call to lead. In the first few years after he left, I used to wonder which I missed more, my friend or my own naïveté about how these things work. Sometimes the most important lessons learned, are the most painful ones. Despite these unfortunate events, I learned to overcome these obstacles and above all, how to position myself as a leader of an organization. As much as I enjoy friendships and consider myself a good friend to all, I know that once I undertake a duty of loyalty and performance to an organization, business will always come first. And for what it's worth, a true friend will respect that in the long run and let you focus on the job at hand. As we become leaders, there are no manuals, criteria, or books that teaches us about The Friendship Clause of Business. We do not learn about supervising, training or managing the close relationships within our business until we are fully entrenched in it. It is my guess because such a clause is not essential to business leadership. Rather, it is our job to motivate our team towards a vision and build consensus through participation. These specific moments help guide us on our journey as leaders. It molds us into who we are today: the good, the bad and the ugly. But it is how we internalize those moments and apply them into our successes and even failures that matter most. So what advice can I share with you today? 1. Focus on the purpose at hand; mission, vision and values of your business. Did we ultimately deliver on the promise? 2. Understand that people matter. It’s not about any one individual nor just the executive. It's about the collective; 3. Do the right thing. If you know something is the right thing, that's what you should be doing. You should not be trying to find a way around it or second guess yourself to accommodate your friends at the sake of the collective; 4. Stop avoiding the difficult conversations. Effective leaders oftentimes make difficult decisions. Attack it head on and fix the necessary issues at had before they fester and get even worse; 5. Get things done: Forget about the friendship and worry about the business and; 6. In the end, Lose A Friend because there is no Friendship Clause in Business. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
"Forget 'Pokemon Go' And Try Geocaching, A Worldwide Scavenger Hunt","Bryan Campbell was on his first tour of Iraq, walking through the desert, when he noticed something shiny hidden deep inside an underground well in Talil. The U.S. Army Reserves chief warrant officer had used his GPS to find his prize, but he didn’t pull up his phone to catch a Sandshrew or a Magikarp. He wasn’t worried about Pokemon at all. It was 2003, just when the war in Iraq began, and “Pokemon Go” hadn’t yet been released to the masses. Campbell was geocaching ― participating in a worldwide, outdoor scavenger hunt of sorts that allows you to use GPS coordinates to find a cache of knickknacks left by a real human being before you. Geocaching has been around since 2000 and is essentially the same thing as “Pokemon Go.” But instead of catching Pokemon on your phone, spending your money on in-app purchases or getting robbed at a Pokestop, you’re trading real-world objects and stories with other hikers and adventurers from across the globe. On that day in 2003, Campbell used coordinates to find a tin container dropped down a well, and he knew there was treasure inside. (Full disclosure: Campbell is my dad, and our resident military guy who regularly chimes in on nonmilitary things with The Huffington Post.) “Somebody put an Altoids tin down a well with a note in it in Talil, Iraq,” he said. “The well had bars over it so I had to get a 20-foot pole and put a magnet on it to get it out.” He added: “The cool thing about geocaching is that you get outside and see things and go to crazy places. Some people leave some pretty neat things behind and there’s a story behind every cache.” Campbell took the note from his tin and replaced it with a military patch, signed his name on the ledger inside and dropped it back down the well. This is a way better use of your adventure time than sitting around waiting for a Charmander to show up. With an iPhone ― or, on remote adventures like a hike on a mountain, with a super-accurate GPS location device ― and the geocaching site, you can grab up coordinates near you, read hints about a cache’s location, and then trade a trinket of equal value for the next person who finds that cache. We get it, “Pokemon Go” is really fun. Even the folks at Geocaching.com are excited about it. “Geocaching is all about adventure and exploration. People seem to be having a great time getting outside with ‘Pokemon Go,’ so that’s a good thing,” Chris Ronan, a spokesman at the site, told The Huffington Post. “It’s also caused a lot of folks to learn about geocaching, so that’s a good thing, too!” But the real-world implications here trump the Pokedex ― we all already caught the 151 back in the day, anyway. With geocaching, you’ll find yourself solving riddles in Manhattan, summiting Mount Rainier for a hidden cache, or finding cool new places in your hometown on any number of geocaching sites. With more than 2.8 million geocaches worldwide, we doubt you’ll be able to catch ‘em all. More stories like this:",TECH,TECH
Venus Williams Entered Intersection Legally Moments Before Fatal Crash: Police,"Florida police released new video on Friday proving that tennis star Venus Williams legally entered an intersection moments before she was involved in a deadly car crash near her neighborhood in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Authorities initially alleged that Williams was “at fault” in the fatal crash that occurred on the afternoon of June 9. A police report released in late June claimed the athlete was traveling around 5 miles per hour when she failed to yield the right of way to another driver when entering an intersection, and was subsequently hit. Witnesses told police that the other driver, 68-year-old Linda Barson, entered the intersection on a green light when she hit Williams’ vehicle, according to the earlier police report.  The Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said on Friday that the new video evidence shows that Williams “lawfully entered the intersection on a circular green traffic signal,” according to a statement released with the video and obtained by HuffPost. Police said in the new statement that Williams was traveling north through the intersection when a Nissan Altima cut her off and made a left turn in front of Williams’ vehicle. The Altima caused Williams to “stop advancing through the intersection to avoid a collision,” the statement read. Once the Altima passed Williams, she continued lawfully through the intersection. Around the same time, Barson’s light had just turned green and Barson’s vehicle entered the intersection, where it collided with Williams’ vehicle. Jerome Barson, Barson’s 78-year-old husband and a passenger in the car, suffered a head injury during the accident and died two weeks after the crash.  The Barson family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Williams, who was not injured in the accident, claiming that Jerome Barson’s death was caused “as a result of the negligence of Williams,” the Palm Beach Post reported last week.  Michael Steinger, the Barson family’s attorney, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Friday’s video still shows that Williams caused the accident and violated “the Barsons’ right of way.” “There is nothing that disputes Ms. Williams was in the intersection on a red light, and the witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection,” Steinger said. Police said on Friday that the crash is still under investigation and that officers are still working to identify the driver of the Altima, according to the Palm Beach Post. Williams, who is currently in London at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships, has not been cited or charged for her role in the crash. During a news conference following her first-round win on Monday, she broke down in tears when a reporter asked her about the car crash. “There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and ― yeah. I’m completely speechless,” Williams said to the crowd of reporters, before stepping away from the conference in tears. She later returned, saying she would only answer questions about tennis.

America's Housing Crisis Is Spreading To Smaller Cities,"“Have you considered the racket and the lights and the crowds and the traffic, and everything that’s going to happen to those of us who live here?” It is a familiar sight in America: the public meeting, the angry residents, the housing developer trying to explain himself over the boos. “Take the money you’ve got and get out of here,” one person shouts. A chant begins: “Oppose! Oppose! Oppose!” Except this is not San Francisco or L.A. or Boston. It is Boise, Idaho. And it is a preview of the next chapter in the housing crisis. Rising rents, displacement and, yes, NIMBYism are spreading from America’s biggest cities to those in its middle tier. Last year, according to an Apartment List survey, the fastest-rising rents in the country were in Orlando, Florida; Reno, Nevada; and Sacramento, California. Another survey, by RentCafe, found exactly one city with a population greater than 500,000 ― Las Vegas ― in the top 25. Small cities are starting to face the same challenges as larger ones. Renting a two-bedroom apartment in Jacksonville, Florida, requires earning at least $18.63 per hour ― $10.53 more than the state minimum wage. In Tacoma, Washington (pop. 211,000), a property management company is evicting low-income residents so it can flip their building into luxury units. Boise, where downtown condos are going for $400,000, was the seventh most unequal city in America in 2016, a jump from 79th place just five years earlier. And it’s only going to get worse. As the poor get pushed inward from the coasts and as young workers seek out the few affordable places left, they will arrive in America’s smaller cities ― which may not be ready to take them. Boise is, by some measures, the fastest-growing city in America. It added 3 percent to its population last year and Idaho is projected to add another 200,000 people by 2025. This should be good news. The city’s growth is driven by a booming, diversified economy and an influx of skilled, educated young people. But Boise isn’t adding homes fast enough to keep up. According to an analysis from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there’s a demand for more than 10 times as many homes as the city is building. Without anything new available, incoming residents are scooping up what’s already there, bidding up costs and pricing out current residents. The impact is devastating. Nearly half of Boise’s renters are living in apartments that eat up over 30 percent of their income. Since 2005, as living costs have exploded, Boise’s median income has fallen and the number of homeless children has more than doubled. Last month, a 5-year-old died when the car her family was sleeping in caught fire in a Walmart parking lot. And yet, even as the city’s needs have grown, its ability to meet them has diminished. According to Deanna Watson, the executive director of the Boise City/Ada County Housing Authority, Boise provides rental vouchers to around 2,500 low-income residents. If they can only afford, say, $300 per month, and their rent is $800, the vouchers make up the difference. With rents booming, though, the assistance isn’t keeping up. HUD recalculates the value of the vouchers every year. But some Boise landlords are raising rents every 60 days. “I’ve been doing this for 21 years and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Watson says. One voucher recipient lives in an old hotel converted into apartments. He uses a motorized wheelchair and needs live-in care. His rent has gone up $275 in the last 18 months, and he’s falling behind. “We’ve got people spending 80 to 90 percent of their income on rent, even with a rental assistance voucher,” Watson says. “And if they get evicted, or leave on their own, there’s no place for them to move.” The perverse incentives don’t end there. Boise’s federal voucher allotment is determined each year by the previous year’s spending. With the apartment vacancy rate at 1 percent, and landlords refusing to rent to Boiseans who receive housing assistance (which is legal under Idaho law), it can take months for low-income residents to find anywhere that will take them. To federal administrators, though, every unused rental voucher looks like unspent funding. Watson says it’s nearly impossible for the local housing authority to predict how many of the vouchers will actually get used. If the agency underspends, HUD will cut its budget. If it overspends, the city will have to make up the difference. Boise’s 2015 Housing Needs Assessment notes that since 2010, as the need for subsidized housing has increased, the use of rental vouchers has fallen. “When the need goes up,” Watson says, “the funding goes down.” The same vulnerabilities are showing up in small cities across the country. In Orlando, where rents rose by almost 8 percent last year, the median rent already takes up 71 percent of the median income. According to Apartment List, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest per capita eviction rate in the country between 2015 and 2017. Montana has seen a 33 percent rise in homelessness in the last decade. Smaller cities have lower rents, but they also have lower wages, less diverse economies and fewer social services. Everything that makes it easier to get onto the housing ladder in places like Boise also makes it easier to fall off. It’s tempting to look at the housing crisis in Boise as just a miniature version of what’s already happened in the Bay Area and the Pacific Northwest and the Northeastern corridor. But in the last 10 years, the American economy has transformed in ways that are going to make it even harder for smaller cities to respond to growth. In 2007, the city of Boise was issuing more than twice as many building permits as it is now. Despite having 125,000 more residents, Boise’s metro area built fewer homes in 2016 than it did in 2004. The reason, says Gary Hanes, a retired HUD administrator based in Boise, is that the recession wiped out the city’s construction sector. Between 2008 and 2012, Boise home prices fell by 40 percent. With homebuilding stalled, thousands of construction workers took other jobs or left for North Dakota or Alaska. By 2012, once all the low-cost and foreclosed homes had been scooped up and the city needed new housing again, there was no one left to build it. This isn’t just a Boise problem. Construction workers, even in high-paid jobs and booming cities, are in short supply. Plus, thanks to increasing international demand, prices for timber, steel and concrete are going up nationwide. Banks have gotten more risk-averse since the recession, preferring to finance “sure bets” ― such as McMansions in the suburbs ― over “riskier” projects like urban apartment blocks or affordable housing. The higher costs of materials, financing and labor, combined with the years-long lag in homebuilding, have made construction unbearably expensive. Fred Cornforth, the CEO of the CDI/Idaho Development and Housing Organization, builds affordable housing in 17 states. He tells me that his last project in Boise cost around $155,000 per apartment ― cheaper than Seattle, where he also develops properties, but not by as much as you’d think. This, Cornforth says, is the fundamental challenge of the housing crisis in Boise and everywhere else: The only way make prices fall is to overbuild. You need vacancy rates of 8 percent or more before rents start to come down. But the backlog is so great, and the costs of building are so high, that it’s impossible even to meet the current demand. Every year, he says, as the backlog grows, the costs go up and the challenge of meeting the need gets worse.  Then there are all the challenges of being located in a red state. Not that California and Massachusetts are exactly exemplars of equitable growth, but nearly all of Boise’s problems are exacerbated by neglect or outright sabotage from state lawmakers.  The city is barred, for example, from forcing developers to reserve a percentage of their units for affordable housing. The state’s Housing Trust Fund, which was created in 1992 and could help alleviate some of the pressure on the vouchers, has never seen a dime of state funding. Plus, Idaho law prevents Boise from taxing itself to provide better city services. Even carpool lanes are forbidden by state law.  “We’ve got a campaign for governor going on right now and there hasn’t been a minute of airtime about how to grow,” says Jerry Brady, a former politician and the founder of Compassionate Boise, a nongovernmental organization that advocates for equitable growth. “It’s all freedom, abortion and who can cut spending the most. There’s never a moment’s conversation about traffic or how to prevent us from becoming the next California.” This makes no financial sense, of course. The Boise area generates 47 percent of Idaho’s gross domestic product. State funding to build more homes, expand public transit or prepare the city’s water and sewer systems for more residents would, in the long run, save money and attract more growth.  And yet, here we are. Many of the cities now experiencing galloping rises in living costs are in rural, Republican-dominated states ― places where increasing funding to low-income renters and investing in public housing are politically impossible. At the federal level, too, help is decidedly not on the way. Last year’s Republican tax plan removed a subsidy for affordable housing developers. Just last week, HUD Secretary Ben Carson announced that his department was shrinking federal housing subsidies. That has implications far beyond Boise. In a survey of 156 mayors earlier this year, 72 percent reported that affordable housing was becoming a problem. Even in small towns, housing costs were the No. 2 concern that mayors reported hearing from their constituents. It’s a nationwide problem ― 87 percent of the country’s 250 biggest cities reported rent rises last year ― but one that cities are still expected to solve by themselves.  Ultimately, the housing crisis is not about housing. It is about the inability of American cities to grow. “It’s hard to acknowledge change,” says Mike Kazmierski, the president of the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada. He’s been watching Reno, another medium-size boomtown, play out the same debates as Boise for over six years now. “If you say your city is going to grow, that means you need another fire station, more schools, more staff. Cities don’t have the budgets for that, and asking for it means raising taxes. The pushback is, ‘We don’t want to pay for that growth. Let them pay for it when they get here.’” This is where Boise starts to look depressingly familiar. In the last few years, as the city’s growth has become more visible, NIMBY groups have taken over the political conversation. Of the 21 speakers at a town hall meeting last month, only two said they welcomed more growth. Signs reading “OVERCROWDING IS NOT SUSTAINABLE” are showing up in front yards. Some local residents, taking a page from the San Francisco playbook, are trying to get their neighborhood classified as a “conservation district” to block new buildings from going in. Some of the complaints have merit ― it’s hard not to be sympathetic to residents asking for sidewalks on their streets or more frequent bus service ― but many are simply pleas for the growth itself to stop. A comment on the Facebook page for Vanishing Boise, one of the local anti-development groups, is emblematic of the argument: “Why are they coming in the first place?????” As in other cities, this dynamic reveals a fundamental weakness in the American political system: Opposition to growth comes from homeowners and voters, entrenched interests who already have the ear of local politicians. Supporters of growth, the beneficiaries of all the new development, haven’t even moved here yet. This means, says Zoe Olsen, the executive director of the Intermountain Fair Housing Council, that local opposition is often focused on preventing growth rather than managing it. “Everyone wants to preserve the farmland around us,” she says. “But these neighborhood groups are fighting for things like, ‘Let’s have one home per acre.’ The only way we’re going to preserve our parks and our beautiful pastoral feeling is by building upwards.” But there is no political constituency for this argument. Boise’s homeownership rate is 68 percent ― 25 points higher than San Francisco’s. Despite a Boise State University study showing that the city will lose twice as much of its farmland if it continues to expand through sprawl rather than density, most local advocacy groups are making the same argument San Francisco homeowners have made for decades: If we don’t build it, they won’t come. It’s the same in other midsize, housing-crunched cities: Thanks to the highways and homeowners already there, it’s almost impossible to form the critical mass to make hard decisions about how to grow. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, spent years debating whether to build a single low-income housing complex. Franklin, Tennessee, changed its zoning to allow less density after a developer put 20 houses on a 24-acre plot. In Boise, residents resisted a city plan to base the F-35 fighter jet nearby ― along with the high-paying, secure military jobs that accompany it ― because they didn’t want the noise. But there are shoots of hope, too. Hanes, the retired HUD administrator, points out that Boise is building dedicated housing for its chronically homeless population. Of the 1,000 housing units under construction downtown, more than 250 are reserved for low-income residents. Hanes started a group, Love Your Neighbor, that shows up at City Council meetings and argues for more growth. And Hanes, who lived in San Francisco during its early boom years, sees one significant difference between the new housing crisis in smaller cities and the decades-old one in bigger metropolises. “Here,” he says, “we can still solve it.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated Boise is projected to add another 200,000 people to its population by 2025. In fact, that is the estimated population growth for the state of Idaho.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
"Britain's Growing Bookmaking Industry, And The Challenges Ahead","While the spectre of Brexit continues to impact on the UK, there are some national industries that are continuing to thrive. Take Britain's betting industry, for example, which according to a recent report by Deloitte directly contributes in excess of £2.3 billion to the nation's GDP. 
   This is the result of a progressive approach to legalising and regulating sports betting in the UK, which has in turn monetized the sector and enabled the government to access additional tax revenues. 
   The macroeconomic climate is creating something of a perfect storm for the market, however, while other factors mean that there are likely to be challenges ahead for the remainder of 2017 and beyond.
 The Facts and Figures Behind the Growth
 Aside from generating £2.3 billion towards the UK's GDP, the British betting industry is also a key creator of jobs. More specifically, it directly supported 38,800 positions of employment in 2011, and this has increased incrementally as major high-street brands such as Ladbrokes have increased their offline presence since this time.    
    Paddy Power is the latest bookmaker chain to reveal significant first-quarter growth numbers in 2017, with revenues increasing to £416 million and showcasing a 23% rise on the corresponding figures from the previous year.  
    Not only this, but this growth industry also have a more far-reaching impact on the nation's economy as a whole, with a cumulative economic footprint of £5 billion in terms of Gross Added Value (GAV). Much of this has to do with the market's continued willingness to invest in the UK high-street, which has become an increasingly overlooked entity in the age of digital technology and e-commerce.
 Behind the Headline Numbers: The Challenges Facing Bookmakers
 This growth aside, the industry is facing a number of familiar and unique challenges in the current climate. In terms of the former, bookmakers have suffered from numerous political upsets in recent times, including the EU referendum vote and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. Leicester City's 5000/1 title triumph and Champions League run also qualified as one of Freebets upsets of the season, and altogether these events cost British bookmakers considerable sums of money.   
The macroeconomic climate, which has been partially triggered by Brexit and exacerbated by the upcoming General Election, is also likely to take its toll later in 2017. As the value of the pound continues to trade within an increasingly narrow range against the U.S. Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), for example, so too retail inflation has soared to 9% and taxation levies in the industry have increased.    
   The latter point is particularly important, as the betting market often emerges as a so-called 'soft target' for HM Treasury during challenging economic times. As if to underline this, the Machine Games Duty (MGD) tax now applies a 20% levy to corporeal fruit machines and similar similar slots, and is thought to have cost operators an additional £60 million per annum (which equates to an estimated £7,000 per shop). 
   Can the Market Continue to Thrive?
 The robust growth of the UK's traditional betting sector will come as a surprise to some, particularly given the exponential rise of the online market. In fact, technological advancement has actively enabled major high-street bookmakers to grow, by enhancing the typical customer experience and making it easier for customers to place in-store wagers. 
 Whether this can be sustained has yet to be seen, particularly with the online sports betting and casino market claiming an ever-expanding market share (virtual casinos generated 33% of all gambling revenues in 2016). The traditional industry is certainly poised to enjoy continued success in the near-term, however, while it is also well-placed to cope with a challenging macroeconomic climate while evolving further as a result.

Funerals Start For Victims Of Washington Mudslide As Search Continues For More Victims,"By Jonathan Kaminsky DARRINGTON, Wash., April 5 (Reuters) - Mourners gathered on  Saturday to remember victims killed in Washington state's  mudslide, the first of a series of memorial services for the  more than two dozen dead, even as the search continues for more  victims. A funeral for school custodian Summer Raffo, 36, was taking  place in Arlington, a town only a few miles from the site where  a torrent of mud swept her car off Highway 530 on March 22. Her  brother later pulled her body from the vehicle. Another service was held in nearby Darrington for retired  librarian Linda McPherson, 69, who was found dead in the debris  of her home. Her husband survived when the mudslide engulfed the  dwelling along with about three dozen other properties on the  outskirts of the community of Oso, which lies in the foothills  of the Cascade Mountains northeast of Seattle. ""She was a sweet, mellow, gentle woman,"" said Peter Selvig,  who served on the Darrington School Board with McPherson. In all, three individual memorial services were being held  on Saturday, and a service for four victims was scheduled for  Sunday. So far, 30 people have been confirmed dead by the Snohomish  County Medical Examiner's office, and recovery crews were still  searching for another 13 people still unaccounted for, according  to county officials. The medical examiner, Jane Jorgensen, told Reuters via email  that her staff was working over the weekend at the site of the  slide and in the office identifying more victims, but will not  provide any official updates until Monday. Roughly 450 people from 117 different organizations were  helping the search efforts, officials said. A community candlelight vigil was planned Saturday in  Darrington and more than 300 people were expected to attend,  said  Michael Duncan, the pastor of Mountain View Baptist Church  who was organizing the event. ""This is an opportunity to begin the healing process,""  Duncan said. Over the next few days, funerals are planned for 5-year-old  Kaylee Spillers, whose father and two siblings are among the  dead and missing, and Alan Bejvl, 21, whose fiance, Delaney  Webb, was also killed in the slide. Recovery efforts have been hampered by rain creating  treacherous conditions and raising the risk of further slides  and flash floods. More rain and runoffs of melting mountain snow  are forecast. A team of volunteer veterinarians was rotating shifts on  Saturday to tend to rescue dogs that have been deployed to help  in the search for more victims. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said it is  deploying its ""Reserve Veterinary Corps"" for the first time. The  group of 135 animal health specialists will treat dogs for minor  cuts, hyperthermia and damaged pads, as well as decontaminate  them after exposure to hazardous material and other pollutants  in the debris field. County officials are also organizing a ""reunification""  location and process so that survivors will be able to go to  retrieve personal property recovered from the disaster site.

NFL Pledges Donations To Military Nonprofits In Hashtag Campaign,"The National Football League appears to be throwing even more weight behind those who interpret the #TakeaKnee movement protesting racial inequality as a sign of disrespect for the military. The league announced on Sunday that for every use of the #SalutetoService hashtag on social media it would donate $5 to select military nonprofit groups. The campaign will benefit the USO, the Pat Tillman Foundation, which offers scholarships to veterans and their spouses, TAPS, which offers grief assistance, and the Wounded Warrior Project, which supports injured service members. For every use of #SalutetoService, the @NFL donates $5 to its military nonprofit partners @pattillmanfnd, @TAPSorg, @the_USO & @wwp https://t.co/2PS7ZyF70U The #SalutetoService campaign comes in the wake of the controversy over the social justice #TakeaKnee protest. Last season, former San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem as a way to call out racism in the United States. Since the newest season began, many more players have engaged in the protest, galvanized by President Donald Trump’s criticism of players that kneel. During a political rally in Alabama, Trump decried the practice, saying that owners should fire players who do it. He said that owners should say, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired. He’s fired!” But the movement has shown staying power despite the controversy surrounding it. A game held late last month saw the majority of Houston Texans players taking a knee after a controversial comment from the team’s owner. Last month, league commissioner Roger Goodell announced that he believes “everyone should stand” for the national anthem, citing the importance of “honor[ing] our flag and our country.” But he said that the league wouldn’t force players to stand. With the #SalutetoService campaign, Goodell appears to be going a step further. Meanwhile, NFL players have requested a formal mediation with league leadership over the protest issue, CBS reported Sunday. The group insists that the talks include Kaepernick, who is taking legal action against the league for allegedly colluding against him. Kaepernick has remained an unsigned free agent since leaving the 49ers. While the #SalutetoService campaign shows the league donating money, the NFL has received funds to demonstrate national pride in the past. Between 2012 and 2015, the Department of Defense spent $6.8 million in taxpayer dollars in exchange for displays of patriotism during games, including flag ceremonies and honoring military service members. A 2015 report by Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake slammed the practice as “paid patriotism.” In a 2015 statement, McCain dismissed it as a cheap “marketing ploy,” saying that “fans should have confidence that their hometown heroes are being honored because of their honorable military service.”  Because players were generally not present on the field during the national anthem until 2009, some have suggested ― but not proven ― that the new tradition was part of the Department of Defense’s efforts. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Elizabeth Warren’s Pick Wins Ohio's Democratic Gubernatorial Primary,"Richard Cordray, the former head of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, won the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio on Tuesday, fending off a challenge from former presidential candidate and House member Dennis Kucinich. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) hand-picked Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, to run the CFPB and raised money for his campaign. Cordray will face Ohio’s current attorney general, Republican Mike DeWine, in the general election race for the governor’s job. Incumbent John Kasich (R) is term-limited. Kucinich ran heavily on his support of Medicare-for-all and won the support of the progressive group Our Revolution, which grew out of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. (Sanders himself did not endorse Kucinich.) Kucinich also attacked Cordray for his past support of gun rights, which earned Cordray an ‘A’ rating from the National Rifle Association when he was attorney general. Cordray now supports universal background checks.  Cordray’s campaign fought back with television ads showing former President Barack Obama praising him.   “Rich took on payday lenders, big banks and student loan schemes that profit at your expense,” a female narrator says in the ad. “And he won.” DeWine defeated Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor in $10 million GOP primary that featured both candidates aligning themselves with President Donald Trump. DeWine is a former U.S. senator who ousted Cordray from the attorney general post in 2010. He begins the race as a slight favorite in a state where Trump scored a nine-percentage-point win in 2016. ",POLITICS,POLITICS
Steve Wynn Out As CEO And Chairman Of Wynn Resorts,"Steve Wynn has resigned as the CEO and chairman of the board of Wynn Resorts. Wynn, 76, announced his resignation in a statement released late Tuesday night, according to NBC News. “I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,” Wynn said in the statement. “As I have reflected upon the environment this has created ― one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts ― I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles.” Wynn announced that Matt Maddox, the current president of Wynn Resorts, will take over his role as CEO. The Las Vegas mogul’s ouster comes one week after he was accused of a decades-long pattern of sexual harassment and abuse toward workers at his casinos, according to The Wall Street Journal. One day after the Journal reported on the alleged history of sexual misconduct, Wynn was forced to resign from his position as finance chair for the Republican National Committee, a position he had held for almost a year. BREAKING: Steve Wynn steps down as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Wynn Resorts. pic.twitter.com/uDobVX2eiM The Journal interviewed more than 100 current and former employees. They accused the billionaire of sexual misconduct ranging from lewd comments and intimidation to inappropriate touching and solicitation of sex acts. A former manicurist at Wynn Las Vegas told the newspaper that Wynn pressured her into having sex with him despite objecting to his advances after she gave him a manicure in 2005. Wynn denied the accusation in a statement shared with HuffPost, but he reportedly paid the woman a $7.5 million settlement after she filed a report to human resources. A former massage therapist at the spa in Wynn Las Vegas told the Journal she had felt pressured to agree to Wynn’s request to massage his penis to ejaculation, a practice that went on for several months. She said Wynn did not pay her more for the request. The massage therapist told the Journal that she eventually told Wynn she was uncomfortable with his requests. Wynn stopped requesting her for massages after that, she said. Jorgen Gielsen, a former artistic director at the Wynn’s salon told the Journal that the salon’s employees were “petrified” of Wynn and would hide in bathrooms and closets when he approached.  A Wynn Resorts representative told HuffPost last week that the company requires its employees to receive annual anti-harassment training, adding that they also offer an anonymous hotline for harassment claims. “Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr. Wynn,” the representative said. In his resignation statement, Wynn said that the “institution we created ... will remain standing for the long term. I am extremely proud of everything we have built at this company. Most of all, I am proud of our employees.” Nevada’s Gaming Control Board, which is involved in regulating the state’s casinos, is investigating the sexual misconduct allegations. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
The Farm Bill Could Be A Huge Blow To Animals,"UPDATE: Dec. 12 ― The Protect Interstate Commerce Act, also known as the King Amendment, was eliminated from the farm bill before it passed the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. PREVIOUSLY: As Congress fights over the latest farm bill, one proposal has animal welfare and food safety advocates ― and even some farm industry groups ― sounding the alarm. They’re opposing the Protect Interstate Commerce Act, an amendment from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) that they fear could jeopardize thousands of state and local laws regulating food and farming. Also known as the King Amendment, this addition to the draft farm bill would ban states from imposing rules on the sale of out-of-state agricultural products if those rules are more restrictive than federal law ― or the law within a product’s state of origin. So what might this look like in practice? King has repeatedly pointed to a proposed California law that would ban the sale of eggs from hens raised in battery cages — a housing system involving rows of small cages typically deemed inhumane by animal welfare experts. Since battery cages are legal at the federal level, as well as in many states that produce eggs, PICA would bar California’s proposal. Because the term “agricultural products” is so broad, it’s difficult to tell how far-reaching the legislation would be. Some animal welfare and pet industry groups fear it might even extend to laws aimed at stopping the sale of sick or abused dogs from out-of-state puppy mills, The Hill reports. While it’s obvious why many animal welfare advocates would be against PICA, the amendment’s ramifications could extend much further. A Harvard Law School analysis found that PICA “has the potential to void thousands of state and local laws concerning public health and safety,” including laws surrounding food safety, packaging and invasive species. Take California and Oregon, which both have regulations to prevent the import of plants carrying the glassy-winged sharpshooter, an insect that harms grape crops. “PICA may interfere with those states’ ability to enforce such regulations,” the report says. “For example, under PICA a law requiring out-of-state producers to treat agricultural products with pesticides to kill the sharpshooters prior to import arguably places an additional and impermissible condition on them.” Another law that could be voided under PICA, the report says, is a Florida ban on the sale of citrus fruit tainted with arsenic. The potentially widespread consequences of PICA are why such a diverse set of interests are aligned against it. Groups ranging from Farm Sanctuary ― which promotes animal welfare and veganism ― to the Alabama Poultry Growers Association are urging Congress not to pass the farm bill with the amendment attached. Environmental groups, food safety advocates, workers rights organizations and numerous individual farmers and state lawmakers have also expressed opposition. And some legal experts fear that the act could even wind up changing the way states can regulate farming within their own borders — not just the sale of out-of-state products. King has said that it’s not his intention for it to work that way. “If California, or any other state, wants to regulate how products are made within their borders, they can do so,” he said in an April press release about the amendment. But Rebecca Cary, senior staff attorney at the Humane Society of the United States, told HuffPost things might not be so clear-cut. The reason? PICA’s vague wording opens it up to extremely broad interpretation. She explained in an email: “In-state production laws could be vulnerable because the amendment places conditions not on the SALE of agricultural products, but on the production or manufacture of agricultural products that are sold in interstate commerce.” One potential victim of PICA, the Humane Society warns, is a landmark Massachusetts law to prohibit the intensive confinement of animals through systems like pig gestation crates. “Because most Massachusetts producers ultimately sell at least some of their products in markets outside of the state, those could be considered impermissible standards under King’s amendment,” Cary said. King wrote a similar amendment to the farm bill back in 2014, but it didn’t make it into the final version. Congress passes a farm bill about every five years ― the 2014 bill was passed late ― that sets policy for farms, food and other areas within the scope of the Department of Agriculture. This year, the GOP is struggling to get votes for the bill, in part because of disputes over a provision that would drastically limit access to food stamps.",POLITICS,POLITICS
DON'T PANIC! That Bacon Shortage You Keep Hearing About Isn't Real,"Don’t worry. You’ll still be able to bring home the bacon whenever you want.  News of a possible bacon shortage went viral across social media on Wednesday, but all the squealing was a little premature. “To imply that there’s going to be some shortage of bacon is wrong,” Steve Meyer, vice president of pork analysis at EMI Analytics, told The New York Times. “There’s plenty of hogs coming. There’s going to be plenty of bacon.” The news of a supposed shortage began circulating after it was reported that reserves of the frozen pork bellies from which most bacon is made fell to 17.8 million pounds in December, the lowest point for that month since 1957, according to USA Today.  “Today’s pig farmers are setting historic records by producing more pigs than ever,” Rich Deaton, president of the Ohio Pork Council, told Ohio’s Country Journal. “Yet our reserves are still depleting.” But Chris Young, executive director of the American Association of Meat Processors, told Time that it only takes six months to raise a pig for processing so farmers can catch up fast. “We are aware of reserve levels, however, we are not concerned,” Young was quoted as saying. “We don’t see America’s love of bacon going away anytime soon. The industry will not run out and farmers will respond in time to take advantage.” Indeed, Joyce Kelly, executive director of the Colorado Pork Producers Council, told CBS 4 in Denver that bacon inventories are expected to rise by 5 percent this year. The dip in the reserves caused pork belly prices to jump 20 percent in early January, so while bacon won’t be in short supply, it could cost a little more. Thus far, that hasn’t happened. A pound of bacon today is actually 11 percent cheaper than it was a year ago, per USA Today. And even if the price of bacon rises, it’s not expected to hurt sales much.  “People will pay what it costs to buy bacon because they love it,” Brooks Reynolds, creator of Iowa’s Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival, told The Associated Press.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Don't Publicly Mock People Who Look A Little Funny Using Technology,"Our modern era looks a little weird sometimes. The hottest gadgets around are big, wire-stuffed virtual reality boxes you strap to your face. It's hard to look dignified playing with them. Still, that's no excuse for taking video footage of someone and posting it online for the entire world to gawk at and retweet. Here's case No. 1: a short clip of a man playing with a Samsung Gear VR on Boston's public transit system last week. His face is obscured by the device, which is why we're comfortable embedding the footage here. It was retweeted over 200 times after Twitter user Neil Lindquist originally posted it, and an account called Internet of Shit boosted it to greater heights days later. catching a train in 2016 pic.twitter.com/L9f7n9kOno Here's a guy trying to enjoy himself during the worst part of anyone's day -- cramming into a germ-filled space on a subway ride -- and strangers took the opportunity to post video footage of him online for others to laugh at.  Sure, the guy looks a little silly. As the BBC and Boston Globe both pointed out, it's probably not safe to wear a device that completely removes your ability to see and hear the world around you when rocketing through a major city.  But that's not really what these Twitter users were getting at. They're pointing at a person and laughing. ""Luckily, I caught him at one of his animated moments, which seems to have been pretty popular on the Internet so far,"" Lindquist told the BBC.  Yeah, how lucky for you. (For what it's worth, Lindquist said the man he recorded came forward after the video was published online, and that he was ultimately OK with Lindquist keeping it there.)  The Internet of Shit account exists to point out ridiculous examples of new technology. Did it need to make its point with this innocent dude on the train? How is this furthering the conversation? There are smarter ways to examine the aesthetic of virtual reality that don't involve embarrassing straphangers. The takeaway for a lot of people is that it's perfectly acceptable to record others looking weird in public places to gain a few minutes of Internet fame. Case No. 2: a man using a Bluetooth keyboard to type on his phone during a subway ride in New York City. He published an article about his shaming experience last week, so we're OK showing you a tweet depicting what happened. @blerms he's not aimlessly pounding on keys either. He's seemingly typing with purpose. It was this, but for 15 mins pic.twitter.com/vqs5bmpwuY The man, Jason Wishnow, said he was typing some notes for a screenplay while on his way to work. You can probably imagine how much that sucks: You're folded into a seat on the subway, doing your best to be productive before work, and someone thinks you look ridiculous and publishes footage of you online without permission. There's a reason why this matters, and it's not just that it's unkind. Steven Spohn, an advocate for people with disabilities who runs TheAbleGamers Foundation, explained why in a series of tweets responding to Wishnow's story Saturday. As somebody who looks WAY out of the ""norm,"" I sometimes ponder if I've been photo-mocked on social media.https://t.co/LDgq2PNNBP But I do my best to shut those internal voices out of my mind because the truth is the answer is most likely ""yes."" We live in a society where people are encouraged to find different-looking humans in a foolhardy quest to gain RTs & likes by mocking others The most heartbreaking pictures are people who have obvious physical or mental disabilities. More often than not, these photos target innocent people simply going about their business, living their lives as if no one was watching. Except we are. In an age of 24/7 video surveillance, we're always watching and being watched... judged. If you see someone who is out of the ordinary, leave 'em alone.

Kemosabe The Chatty Porcupine Eats a Banana (VIDEO),"Kemosabe is an adorable porcupine currently residing at the Animal Wonders center in Missoula, Montana. Based on his appearance, it looks like Kemosabe is a prehensile-tailed porcupine, a group primarily found in Central and South America. According to the woman feeding Kemosabe, unlike most porcupines he only has one tooth instead of two top incisors. One had to be removed upon his arrival to Animal Wonders center due to a previously developed infection. However, if his love of bananas is any indication looks like the little guy is handling a one toothed life just fine.

Tom Brady Has This Wish For Radio Host Who Insulted His 5-Year-Old Daughter,"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said Monday night that he doesn’t want radio station WEEI to sack the host who called his 5-year-old daughter Vivian “an annoying little pissant.” Alex Reimer used those words on Thursday commenting on a Facebook documentary about Brady in which the child informs her father she’s going to play soccer. Reimer was suspended indefinitely by the station. Brady on Monday morning cut short his weekly interview on another WEEI show to express his dismay over the comment and said he’s considering whether to stop appearing on the show. But Brady struck a magnanimous tone later Monday in Minneapolis, the site of Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. “We all have careers and we all make mistakes,” he said at a press conference in the segment above from Boston’s CBS affiliate. “I’d hate for someone to have to change their life because of something like that. It’s certainly not what he intended.” Brady also addressed what he said to WEEI earlier. “Any parent is protective of their kid,” he said. “I’ve never strayed away from criticism, that’s part of sports. But I don’t think my children or any other children deserve to be in that. That’s how I felt.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
Publix Suspends Contributions To NRA-Backed Politician Amid Protests,"Protests prompted supermarket chain Publix to suspend all political contributions after it was revealed to have given more than half a million dollars to a Florida Republican who called himself a “proud NRA sellout.” Publix was found to have given $670,000 in donations over the past three years to Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner, who is now running for governor. But in Florida, where a school shooter in Parkland killed 17 people earlier this year, many locals aren’t about to let a National Rifle Association “sellout” run their state. On Wednesday, Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg issued a call on Twitter for people to stage a “die in” at the grocery store, which has locations throughout the Southeast.  .@Publix is a #NRASellOut In Parkland we will  have a die in the Friday (the 25th)  before memorial day weekend. Starting at 4pm for 12 min inside our 2 Publix stores. Just go an lie down starting at 4. Feel free to die in with us at as many other @Publix as possible. Prior to the demonstration, Publix issued a statement expressing “regret” that its political contributions had led to an “unintentional customer divide.” On Friday, it released a new statement saying it would be suspending political contributions. “We would never knowingly disappoint our customers or the communities we serve,” the company said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “As a result, we decided earlier this week to suspend corporate-funded political contributions as we reevaluate our giving processes.” The same day, Hogg attended a protest at a Coral Springs Publix, where he and supporters lay on the floor for 12 minutes.

Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Resigns As CEO,"The wheels finally fell off. Travis Kalanick is stepping down from his post as CEO of Uber, effective immediately.  Kalanick’s exit came after a shareholder revolt reportedly made it untenable for him to stay at the company he founded in 2009. Investors called for the change in leadership in a letter that was delivered to Kalanick in Chicago and obtained by Times reporter Mike Isaac. The news was first reported by the New York Times and later confirmed by TechCrunch.  “I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,” Kalanick said in a statement to the Times. He will remain on Uber’s board of directors. In a statement to TechCrunch, the board called Kalanick’s decision “a sign of his devotion and love for Uber.” The embattled former CEO built the ride-hailing company from a scrappy startup into a taxi-killing behemoth valued at nearly $70 billion. But as today’s news demonstrates, valuation only gets you so far. Uber suffered several turbulent months in early 2017. The rise of #DeleteUber in response to the company appearing to break a taxi picket line in early February drove more than 200,000 people to delete the Uber App from their phone in protest, and was only quelled once Kalanick announced he’d resign from President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council. That movement regained steam, however, as lurid claims of a toxic work culture surfaced, courtesy of a tell-all blog by a former employee. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler penned the blog in late February, recalling her experiences with rampant sexual harassment at the company, including being solicited for sex by male superiors and stonewalled by HR for reporting their conduct. Two of Uber’s earliest investors, Mitch and Freada Kapor, spoke out at the time and urged the company to switch gears. “Uber’s outsize success in terms of growth of market share, revenues and valuation are impressive, but can never excuse a culture plagued by disrespect, exclusionary cliques, lack of diversity, and tolerance for bullying and harassment of every form,” the two wrote. “Uber has had countless opportunities to do the right thing,” they added. “We feel we have hit a dead end.” Kalanick pledged to clean up the company culture in response. He asked former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an inquiry, and got former Huffington Post editor-in-chief (and Uber board member) Arianna Huffington to pitch in. Uber has had countless opportunities to do the right thing. We feel we have hit a dead end. Yet another crisis developed soon after: Waymo, a Google-founded competitor, sued Uber, claiming the company had stolen technology essential to the development of its self-driving cars. Uber competitor Lyft continued to pick up steam all the while. Amid mounting evidence of deep-rooted problems at the company, however, a video of Kalanick angrily telling off an Uber driver may have hit his personal standing the hardest. The video shows Kalanick discussing the company’s fare structure with Uber “black car” driver Fawzi Kamel at the end of a ride. Kamel, who purchased a nicer car to drive for the upscale “black” service, tells Kalanick he “lost $97,000 because of you. I’m bankrupt because of you.” In response, Kalanick fires back, “You know what? Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own shit.” “They blame everything in their life on somebody else,” he adds, edging out of the back seat. “Good luck,” he adds, sarcastically, then slams the door.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Wimbledon Star Forced To Leave Court After Suffering Knee Injury,"American tennis star Bethanie Mattek-Sands was rushed to a hospital on Thursday after suffering a brutal knee injury during a Wimbledon match. Mattek-Sands, 32, was competing against Sorana Cirstea when she slipped on the court and screamed out in pain. “Help me, help me, please!” she cried out after collapsing to the ground. Cirstea told BBC News that she had never seen such an injury. “It was like something you see only in the movies,” Cirstea said. “I tried to comfort her but I panicked. I felt useless. All she kept saying was, ‘Sorana, help me, help me.’” The extent of Mattek-Sands’ injury is not yet known. Mattek-Sands was tied with Cirsea, at one set apiece, as the match headed into the third set at the All England Club. They had been playing the set for 13 minutes when the injury happened. Mattek-Sands was forced to retire from the game and was taken to a hospital after more than 20 minutes of on-court treatment by medical staff.

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Recalled Over Battery Fires,"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd formally recalled 1 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones sold in the United States, replacing or refunding the flagship phones, whose susceptibility to catching fire has damaged the image of the Korean powerhouse. Samsung received 92 reports of batteries overheating in the United States, including 26 reports of burns and 55 cases of property damage, the company said as it announced the recall in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The recall is a costly setback for Samsung, which was counting on Galaxy Note 7 to bolster sales as rivals such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O> launch new devices. The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker. Samsung said on Thursday that new Note 7 replacement devices will be available at most retail locations in the United States no later than Sept. 21. Earlier this month, Samsung said it would recall all Note 7 smartphones equipped with batteries it found to be fire-prone and halted their sales in 10 markets, denting a revival of the firm’s mobile business. While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, the nature of the problem for the Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung’s reputation, analysts have said. The CPSC said on Thursday that consumers should immediately power down and stop using the recalled Galaxy Note 7 devices. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has asked airline passengers to switch off and unplug the recalled Note 7s during flights. Some 2.5 million of the premium devices worldwide need to be recalled, Samsung said. Some analysts say the recall could cost Samsung nearly $5 billion in lost revenue this year.   (Reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Jim Finkle; Editing by Don Sebastian)",TECH,TECH

"Football's Concussion Crisis Is Killing Former High School Players, Too","Imagine your husband hanging from the rafters in the garage, or your father dead in a barn outside his home. Let’s say he played football decades ago in high school or college, never sniffed the NFL. Then he got a job, raised a family. But the game caught up with him, and now he’s one of its faceless casualties. The issue of concussions in football wouldn’t seem so abstract anymore, would it? Michael King was a beloved doctor in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, known in the community for his interest in sports medicine. Michael’s son, Alex King, would sometimes tag along on patient visits when the boy was 5 or 6 years old, and remembers his father’s compassion.  “Once we met an 80-year-old woman who was 200 pounds overweight, and he held her hand, joked with her, kissed her on the forehead,” says Alex, now 29. “And I saw that sort of thing many times.” Michael was a quarterback in high school, and he went on to play at Division-III Hampden-Sydney College. Susan DeRamus, Michael’s wife of nearly 30 years, first met Michael just after college. He was a strapping former athlete. She was working at Montaldo’s, a store in Greensboro, North Carolina, when Michael’s mother and sister came in shopping for bridesmaid dresses. Susan overheard Michael’s mother say that the wedding was at a Catholic church, and blurted out, “Where in the hell did you find a Catholic boy? I can’t find one anywhere.” “I happen to have two sons,” the mother said, and invited Susan to the wedding. Her first impression of Michael was strong. “He was just so handsome,” she remembers. At the wedding, Susan caught the bouquet, and she and Michael were married nine months later, in July 1973. Their first decade together was marked by hope for the future, as Michael worked hard to launch his medical career and the couple started a family. Michael always maintained a deep affinity for student athletes. Alex remembers it was common for the family to be eating dinner while his father examined a local football player, the young man’s leg propped up on the kitchen counter between the plates and forks. But as the years passed, Michael gradually became more irritable, short with his wife and tough on his four children ― sons Alex and Mike, and daughters Katie and Marylynn. “There would be times when he would be a sweet man, a giving man, very humble and kind,” Alex says. “And there were times when he would totally flip the script and be volatile and angry.” Late last month, a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association grabbed headlines with a startling statistic: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, was discovered in 110 of the 111 former NFL players whose families donated their brains to the Boston University School of Medicine. The disease, caused by head trauma, leads to dementia, memory loss, suicidal thoughts, and personality and mood changes, among other progressive symptoms. The New York Times ran a two-page spread with photos and blurbs about the players; since then, stars from Ben Roethlisberger to Boomer Esiason have discussed CTE with a frankness that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. But absent from the ensuing soul-searching and regret were the names and lives behind the other numbers in the study. The figures were less publicized, but are more relevant to average Americans: CTE was found in the brains of 3 of 14 high school players (21 percent), and 48 of 53 college players (91 percent). The study also showed high rates of CTE among semi-professional and Canadian Football League players. “How do you go from an incredibly intelligent, personable, kind, loving, funny ― all around just a great guy ― to so much mental anguish and pain you hang yourself in the garage?” wrote Kathy Grant, whose husband, Peter Grant, died in 2011, in a bio for a 2016 Boston University CTE event. Peter sustained seven known concussions as a high school football and hockey player, and played intramural sports while attending Notre Dame in the early 1980s. Kathy remembers her husband’s downward spiral, beginning in 2009: One parents weekend at Notre Dame, the school all three of their children attended, Peter was so depressed that he could barely come out of the hotel room. Another time at the kitchen table back home, Peter became agitated and hurled a laptop across the room, smashing it against the wall. Other times he was confused or suicidal. On Feb. 8, 2011, Peter hanged himself in the family garage. He was 49. Kathy donated his brain to Boston University for concussion research, and Peter was posthumously diagnosed with CTE. The NFL responded to the recent JAMA report by pointing out that the study’s sample came from brains families had donated ”because of the players’ repeated concussions and troubling symptoms before they died.” A league spokesperson told HuffPost that ”the issue of player health and safety is extremely important to the NFL and we are always looking at how we can make our game safer.” Some fans point to the prospect of fame and big-money contracts as trade-offs for the brutal health risks of the game. Yet the vast majority of those hurt by the sport never get close to cashing in. Instead, they’re left with ruined lives and haunted families. Even though he never played professionally, Michael’s life was marked by injuries from his football days. “He was so physically debilitated because of all of his injuries from football,” says Mike King, now 38. “He had both knees replaced at different times. He had both shoulders replaced. I believe he had a hip replacement. He had severe rheumatoid arthritis that had gradually worsened to the point where the knuckles on his hand were giant, and the last few years of his life he couldn’t operate any more.” Michael was clear about one thing: He didn’t want the boys playing football. Mike wasn’t interested in the game, but Alex was. He wanted to emulate and connect with his dad. So he insisted on playing, and ended up a quarterback himself in middle and high school.  Alex’s injuries mounted from the beginning; Mike recalls one time when his brother was pushed out of bounds, and his helmet came off as his head crashed into the bleachers. The family was relieved when Alex switched from quarterback to punter to play at Duke University, where he excelled and thought he might even be drafted by an NFL team. But even that safer position left his brain vulnerable to damage. “Just because you don’t play quarterback doesn’t mean you don’t get concussions,” Alex says. “When you’re a punter, you’re a sitting duck running down the field. And if you don’t do a good enough punt and it gets returned, you’re the most blockable person on the field. And I got leveled several times. The game is dangerous no matter what position you play.” Each year, approximately 1,700 men make NFL rosters, but that is a tiny fraction of how many Americans play football. A spokesperson for the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, a trade organization that collects data on sports participation, told HuffPost that 5.5 million people ages 6 and up participated in tackle football in 2016, a number that includes youth, high school, college and post-college. But should these children and adults be playing at all? It really worth the risk, if there is chance a player could end up declining in middle age like Michael King or Peter Grant? To Dr. Bennet Omalu, the man credited with discovering CTE, the answer is simple: no. He recently equated youth football to child abuse. “Someday there will be a district attorney who will prosecute for child abuse [on the football field], and it will succeed,” Omalu said at an event in New York. “It is the definition of child abuse. If you play football, and if your child plays football, there is a 100 percent risk exposure.” A spokesperson for USA Football, the national governing body for amateur football in America, told HuffPost in a statement that it supports research to promote sport safety, and incorporates “evidence based practices into our programs.” “As a result, our programs are supported by leading medical organizations and recognized for advancing player safety and coaching education,” it said. USA Football works in conjunction with the NFL, which funds the development and implementation of player safety techniques. In 2015, USA Football released new tackle football practice guidelines, including “clear definitions of contact and time limits on full player-to-player contact,” the NFL spokesperson said. Sometimes when she’s out on a run near her home, Kathy Grant sees small children at football practice. “They’re little, probably 6 or 7,” she says. “I want to say to their mothers and fathers who are sitting around talking with each other while the kids are playing ― just like we used to do ― I just want to just go up to them and say, ‘My God, don’t let them get hit.’” Susan and Michael divorced in 2001. In the coming years, his decline would accelerate. “He was weepy, and you could see his eyes were sort of sunken,” Mike says. “Redness around the eyes. There was this overall aura and physical appearance of deep, deep depression and hopelessness.” Once, when Alex was playing for Duke and the team took a tough loss, Susan noticed Michael sitting alone in the bleachers, head in hands, sobbing. “It was just not normal for a grown man to cry about a football game like that,” she says.  In October of 2011, Mike became so concerned that he decided to drive from the Washington, D.C. area, where he worked as an attorney, to check on his father in North Carolina. He planned to head south on the evening of Friday, Oct. 7. But early that morning, Michael walked into a barn near his house and used a rope to hang himself. His family donated his brain for the Boston University study. It confirmed what they had always suspected: Michael had CTE. Talking about their dad evokes heavy sighs and tears. But Michael’s family wants to speak out to raise awareness among fellow football-loving families. This game can destroy the Everyman just as easily, if not more so, than the celebrity athlete. In the years since his death, Michael’s family has tried to cope with the loss by reminding themselves that their father had a degenerative disease; had he lived, he would only have suffered more. Driven by Michael’s passion for sports medicine, the family started the Dr. Michael E. King Memorial Scholarship for student athletes. All four siblings are involved in CTE awareness or policy advocacy efforts. Marylynn is a physical therapist in Seattle, where she cares for patients who are recovering from traumatic brain injuries, spinal injuries, amputations and other severe injuries. As they find ways to ensure their father’s legacy is consistent with his service to athletes, the Kings wonder about their youngest brother’s future. Alex does not want to say whether he fears CTE himself ― but Mike can’t help but worry when he thinks how much time his brother spent playing football, including Alex’s college career. “There’s evidence that certain people can be predisposed to CTE,” Mike says, his voice wavering. “And if we know that our dad got it and was Stage 2 by the time he was 65 and died, to some degree it might run in our family, at least if you’re exposed to these risk factors. So yeah, I ... think about it for Alex, potential long-term problems. I’ve always been concerned about my little brother.” Alex is more garrulous, but drifts into the same tone at times, pausing ― nearly halting altogether ― over his words when discussing his dad. Speaking of her late husband, Susan broke into sobs. “My kids now are remembering a lot of great things, but there is a lot of pain,” she says. “It’s very frightening to see a spouse change, and you think, ‘Oh my God, this guy is nuts, the things he says, it just doesn’t make sense. It’s a little off.’ Michael had an issue with anger, and I think the CTE brought that out.”   “My dad would tell you, he was a regular Joe,” says Mike. “And the scary thing, or the scariest aspect of this CTE problem, may be that there are millions, if not tens of millions of athletes who have played a contact or collision sport.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
The History Of The National Anthem In Sports,"“Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem.” You’ll hear some version of this announcement at the start of most sporting events, whether they be professional, college or youth-level. The performance of the national anthem is a well-established part of American athletic competitions.  Yet “The Star-Spangled Banner” typically doesn’t make an appearance at many other public gatherings. We don’t sing or listen to it before concerts, Broadway shows, operas or lectures. So why do we do this for sports?  The answer goes back to America’s pastime: baseball. First, of course, the national anthem began as a poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, after he witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812 (which ran until early 1815).  During the 19th century, the poem gained popularity as a song set to the tune of another popular song, “To Anacreon in Heaven.” It was performed at events like parades, military ceremonies, Independence Day festivities and, yes,  occasionally, sporting events. The earliest documented performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a baseball game took place at the Union Baseball and Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1862. It was the park’s opening game, and over time, playing the song on the opening day of the baseball season became a more widespread practice. But singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before every game did not become commonplace until later.  In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy signed an order directing that “The Star-Spangled Banner” be the official song to accompany any raising of the American flag by the Navy. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order designating it as the country’s national anthem for patriotic occasions. But that status didn’t become truly official until 1931, when Congress passed a measure that President Herbert Hoover signed into law. Historians typically point to one notable event when tracing the connection between the national anthem and sporting events: Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. It was the final year of World War I, a time when many professional baseball games featured marching drills, live bands and other patriotic elements. Given the strains of wartime, however, Game 1 was not well-attended, and the mood was reportedly somber.  During the seventh-inning stretch, however, the band lifted spectators’ spirits with a powerful performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The New York Times recounted the moment:  As the crowd of 10,274 spectators — the smallest that has witnessed the diamond classic in many years — stood up to take their afternoon yawn, that has been the privilege and custom of baseball fans for many generations, the band broke forth to the strains of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The yawn was checked and heads were bared as the ball players turned quickly about and faced the music. Jackie Fred Thomas of the U.S. Navy was at attention, as he stood erect, with his eyes set on the flag fluttering at the top of the lofty pole in right field. First the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field. It was at the very end that the onlookers exploded into thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm. The performance was so well-received that bands played the song during the subsequent games in the World Series that year. And from then on, “The Star-Spangled Banner” was a regular feature of special baseball occasions like opening day, national holidays and the World Series. During World War II, playing the national anthem before regular baseball games became the norm, thanks to an upswing in patriotic sentiment and technological developments in sound systems that allowed for the playing of the song without the added expense of hiring a band. The practice spread to other sports as well. After the war ended in 1945, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden stated his intention to make “The Star-Spangled Banner” a permanent part of every football game.  “We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for,” Layden declared.  Not everyone in the sports world agreed, however. In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager and World War I veteran Arthur Ehlers decided not to play “The Star-Spangled Banner” before each game and opted to save it for special occasions. He said that frequent repetition “tends to cheapen the song and lessen the thrill of response” and complained about fans not behaving respectfully during the anthem.  Under pressure from the public and the Baltimore City Council, Ehlers eventually changed his mind.  The owner of the Chicago Cubs felt similarly and did not include “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a standard element at home games until the 1960s during the Vietnam War. The Chicago White Sox replaced the anthem with “God Bless America” for a time in the ’60s but then returned to “The Star-Spangled Banner” after fans expressed their preference for it in an official poll.  With its evocations of warfare and patriotism, “The Star-Spangled Banner” has become a seemingly inextricable part of American sports culture ― and even pop culture, thanks to iconic moments like Whitney Houston’s powerful 1991 Super Bowl performance during the Gulf War.  “Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,” Marc Ferris, author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America’s National Anthem, told USA Today last year. “A sort of war without death.” Over the years, the anthem has certainly played a part in cultural wars. Most recently, quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest racial injustice by kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” has been the subject of heated debate.  In 1968, Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were thrown out of Olympic Stadium in Mexico City after raising their fists in a Black Power salute as they stood on the medal podium during “The Star-Spangled Banner.”  Beyond political protests, actual musical performances of the anthem have generated controversy. In 1968, singer-songwriter José Feliciano kicked off Game 5 of the World Series with a bluesy version of the song, which drew complaints from fans expecting a more traditional rendition. In 1990, comedian Roseanne Barr sang the anthem before a Major League Baseball game. She ended her “screechy, off-key” performance by grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground. President George H.W. Bush called Barr’s rendition “disgraceful.” And in February of this year, singer Fergie came under fire for her “sexy” performance of the anthem at the NBA All-Star Game. For a song meant to unite the country, “The Star-Spangled Banner” can also be quite divisive ― which perhaps makes it all the more fitting for sports.

Mars Appears At Its Brightest Tonight As Planet Moves Into Opposition,"Get your telescopes ready -- tonight's sky is expected to be a bright one. Mars will be the brightest it’s been in two years as it undergoes what’s called Mars opposition, an orbital placement that puts the Earth directly between the sun and the Red Planet. As a result, Mars will be brightly illuminated by the sun's rays, making it the brightest object in the Earth's sky, just behind the sun and moon. ""From our perspective on our spinning world, Mars rises in the east just as the sun sets in the west. Then, after staying up in the sky the entire night, Mars sets in the west just as the sun rises in the east,"" NASA explains on its website. It's a phenomenon that happens once every two years (or 26 months), about the time the Red Planet takes to completely orbit the sun. On Sunday, NASA estimates that Mars will be 47.4 million miles away from the Earth. Amateur astronomer Dr. Ian Musgrave, from the University of Adelaide in Australia, has recommended stargazers use telescopes if they have the chance. ""From the point of view of someone standing around looking into the sky, it is just going to be a bright dot,"" he told Australia's ABC News. ""But even if you have a small telescope, the disc of Mars will be big enough to see details and maybe even the polar cap."" Those who miss Sunday's event, worry not. May 30 is expected to be an even bigger show. That's when Mars will make its closest approach to the Earth since 2005, coming about 46.8 million miles away. That process is called the Mars Close Approach. From May 18 to June 3, the planet will appear brighter than usual because of its placement. By mid-June, it will start to become faint, as Mars and Earth move farther apart in their orbits around the sun, NASA explains. Those will miss this month's festivities will have to wait, but fortunately not a lifetime. The next Mars Close Approach is on July 31, 2018.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Trump Changed His Burger Order To Make It A Little Healthier,"President Donald Trump has made a tweak to his diet.  Rudy Giuliani told the Washington Post that when the two met for lunch recently, Trump ate a burger, but with only half a bun as a means of making it healthier. Trump didn’t change what was inside the half-bun: The burger was still cooked well-done, as he likes it.  The former New York City mayor, who is now part of Trump’s legal team, told the newspaper he sometimes goes with half a bun on burgers himself.  “It’s a good way to do it,” Giuliani, who ate a Cobb salad at the Trump meeting, said.  In January, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson told the president to eat better and lose about 10 to 15 pounds. However, Jackson also pronounced Trump to be in “excellent” health despite his well-known love of fast food.  “You know, I told the president that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old,” Jackson said at the time, per The Hill. Trump’s burger tweak included more bun than in the past. Last year, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump’s typical McDonald’s order while on the campaign trail was two Big Macs, two Filet-o-Fish and a chocolate milkshake. But at that point, the future president wasn’t eating the buns at all.  “Well, he never ate the bread, which is the important part,” Lewandowski said on CNN. “He was busy campaigning. We didn’t have time to sit down for a meal.” A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 26, 2016 at 2:29pm PDT The New York Times also reported that Trump would rip the buns off burgers while campaigning.  “Do you know how many calories you save that way?” Trump told the Boston Herald’s Howie Carr.  Trump cuts the carbs when he’s eating pizza, as well.  “I scrape the toppings off my pizza,” he told US Weekly in 2015. “I never eat the dough.” Once in the White House, his eating habits seemed to change. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recounted a lunch with the president earlier this year during a podcast interview with The New York Times. “I am trying to lose a little weight. So I have for lunch usually a cheeseburger with no bun,” Schumer said in January. “And [Trump] had a cheeseburger with a bun and a whole lot of french fries.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
South Carolina Wins First Ever NCAA National Title,"DALLAS ― South Carolina fended off Southeastern Conference rival Mississippi State for the biggest prize in women’s college basketball. The Gamecocks led by as many as 14 points in the second half, then survived a Bulldogs charge to claim a 67-55 victory in the NCAA Tournament championship game on Sunday evening at the American Airlines Center. In doing so, South Carolina (33-4), making its second Final Four appearance under head coach Dawn Staley, won its first national championship. The Bulldogs couldn’t solve South Carolina, falling to the Gamecocks for the third time this season. But Mississippi State (34-5) can hold onto the distinction of being the team that ended Connecticut’s 111-game winning streak as the Bulldogs prevailed in 64-62 in overtime during a Friday semifinal. Forward A’ja Wilson powered the Gamecocks on both offense and defense as she finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. Guard Allisha Gray pitched in 18 points and 10 rebounds. Guard Victoria Vivians led Mississippi State with 12 points, and guard Dominique Dillingham added 11. South Carolina held Bulldogs guard Morgan William, the hero in Mississippi State’s Elite Eight and national semifinal wins, to eight points on 2-of-6 shooting. South Carolina was threatening to run away with the title before Mississippi State clawed back into the contest in the third quarter. The Bulldogs grabbed momentum with a 9-0 run to slice into South Carolina’s 14-point lead. William’s made a steal and layup to highlight the run, then forward Ketara Chapel hit a jumper that cut the Gamecocks’ lead to 45-40 with 3:37 to go in the third quarter. But Wilson and Gray made the key baskets South Carolina needed in the fourth quarter to keep the Gamecocks in the lead. They combined for baskets on back-to-back possessions in the middle of the fourth to restore an eight-point Gamecocks lead with 4:56 remaining, and Mississippi State never got back within six points. South Carolina stretched out a 13-point lead in the first half as it dominated the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second. The Gamecocks trailed by two before they went on a 19-4 run to take control. Gray scored seven points during the surge as she consistently drove into the lane. Wilson helped fuel the run with a layup and a pair of free throws to give South Carolina a 25-16 lead with 6:49 remaining until halftime. Guard Tyasha Harris went to the basket for a layup to cap the run and stake the Gamecocks to a 13-point margin. But Mississippi State battled back despite foul trouble and a scoring drought of more than four minutes in the first half. Reserve forward Chinwe Okorie hit a jumper from the free-throw line, then Dillingham, who played most of the first half with two fouls, drove for a basket. And Vivians made a shot to cut South Carolina’s lead to nine. Wilson and Gray each scored 11 to lead the Gamecocks in the first half. Wilson hit a free throw that put South Carolina ahead 36-26 at the break. NOTES: The all-SEC national championship game between Mississippi State and South Carolina was the sixth time two teams from the same conference met for the tournament title. It was the third time two SEC teams played in the championship game ― Tennessee vs. Georgia in 1996 and Tennessee vs. Auburn in 1989. ... South Carolina and Mississippi State were each making their first appearance in the national championship game. That marked the first time that two first-timers met in the tournament final since 2005 when Baylor defeated Michigan State. ... South Carolina leads Mississippi State 19-16 in the all-time series. The Gamecocks have a 10-game winning streak in the rivalry that dates to Mississippi State’s last victory over South Carolina on Feb. 11, 2010.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Columnist Calls Out Marshawn Lynch To Explain National Anthem Sitdown,"Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch appeared to take a page out of Colin Kaepernick’s playbook and not stand for the national anthem before Saturday night’s preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals. He was photographed sitting on a cooler and holding a banana, prompting memories of last season when then-49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked a national debate over his anthem demonstrations to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Lynch didn’t address his move, but the San Francisco Chronicle’s Scott Ostler wrote in a Sunday column that he should. “It would be nice if he clues us in, because sitting out the national anthem is a big deal. While waiting for word from Planet Marshawn, here’s my wild guess: The sit-down wasn’t unintentional or accidental. Lynch has a distinctive style. He runs hard into people on the field, and he runs hard into authority off the field, and he makes no apologies. If he is protesting, here’s one thing I would like to know: Lynch’s sit-down took place a few hours after the violent ugliness in Charlottesville, Va., and after the president of the United States declined to condemn the hate groups responsible for the deadly violence. Is Lynch protesting that violence? Is he protesting in support of Colin Kaepernick, who remains unemployed even though NFL teams are now signing backup quarterbacks from beach pickup games? If Lynch chooses not to explain his sit-down, he surrenders any power a protest might have.” Raiders coach Jack Del Rio relayed an exchange with Lynch after the game. “He said, ‘This is something I’ve done for 11 years — it’s not a form of anything other than me being myself,’ ” Del Rio said, per the San Jose Mercury News. “I said, ‘So you understand how I feel, I very strongly believe in standing for the national anthem, but I’m gonna respect you as a man. You do your thing, OK, and we’ll do ours.’ ” Pro Football Talk disputed the claim that sitting was a longtime habit of Lynch ― but a stronger clue of where he stands (or doesn’t stand) on the issue was a September interview with Conan O’Brien in which he expressed support for Kaepernick’s move. Meanwhile, Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett made clear his motives for not standing for the anthem in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Bennett said it would be the start of a season-long protest against intolerance. “I hope that I can activate everybody to get off their hands and feet and go out into the communities and push helping each other,” he said, per NFL.com. Now you have the ball, Marshawn. Run with it.  For Scott Ostler’s full column, visit here.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Jim Spencer Died In A Pile Of Dirt. The Law Was Too Weak To Help.,"ALLIANCE, Neb. — In the front yard of a ranch-style house at 2812 Toluca Ave. stands an evergreen tree perhaps four feet high. It marks, by chance, the approximate location of Jim Spencer’s death. Few have reason to know this. One who does is Spencer’s wife, Cheryl, who has parked her Dodge Durango across the street on a late summer morning but does not get out. She was here on the afternoon of March 21, 2016, when the house was under construction. Her husband, a plumber, had been on his knees, laying sewer pipe in an 8-foot-deep trench, when a co-worker driving a backhoe inadvertently buried him in dirt. She watched behind the yellow tape as firefighters and emergency medical technicians worked to extract his 220-pound body. When she last saw him, he was lifeless on a backboard, soil sprinkled in his gray beard and smeared on his forehead. Twenty-six workers died in trench collapses in the United States in 2016 — twice as many as the year before, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Jim Spencer, genial and skilled at his trade, suffocated as he was approaching retirement, at 61. His death unmoored his wife of nearly 40 years, forcing her to take on new responsibilities and fill chunks of time he would have occupied. She pines for his after-work banter, his joking references to her as “old woman,” his ability to fix almost anything that needed fixing. She attends group therapy sessions every few weeks to connect with others who are hurting, and to burn off some of her own anger. “My biggest meltdowns I usually have at home,” she says. “I don’t want anybody to see what those are like.”  When a worker dies of traumatic injury, gloom spreads like a webbed crack on an ice-covered pond, reaching far beyond the immediate family to touch former colleagues, lifelong friends and — in Jim Spencer’s case — waitresses, convenience-store clerks and other strangers he routinely engaged in conversation in this western Nebraska railroad town of 9,000 people. His life and thousands of others were extinguished last year because an employer either didn’t know about or disregarded provisions of the 47-year-old federal law that guarantees a safe workplace. The steps needed to prevent trench cave-ins are no secret — or shouldn’t be. Sections 1926.651 and 1926.652 of regulations adopted under the Occupational Safety and Health Act state, among other things, that heavy equipment must be kept away from trench edges, and that trenches 5 feet or deeper must be shored up “except when excavations are made entirely in stable rock.”  Such was not the case that early spring day in Alliance as Jim Spencer was laying pipe on Toluca Avenue. The general contractor overseeing the building of the house, Clau-Chin Construction, had outsourced the trench-digging to an excavation contractor, Larry Kessler Construction. Interviewed by officials with the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration after Spencer’s death, the owners of both companies — Shaun Houchin, of Clau-Chin, and Kessler — professed ignorance of the OSHA trenching standard. Both were cited and assessed fines of $24,800 and $16,800, respectively. “To me, that was nothing,” Cheryl Spencer says. “How is it you can kill somebody with a car and get charged with vehicular homicide, and kill somebody in a trench and get a slap on the wrist?”  It’s a fair question. The unsatisfying answer is that the protection of workers is not a priority in the United States. The 1970 law creating OSHA was an imperfect compromise between Democrats and Republicans, weak tea that its backers hoped would strengthen over time. In the early days, OSHA inspectors were mocked and reviled by indignant business owners; references to Adolf Hitler and the Gestapo were not uncommon. The agency weathered the leadership of an anti-regulation devotee during Ronald Reagan’s presidency and dodged an existential threat in the 1990s: a failed crusade by a Republican congressman to transform it from enforcer to friendly adviser. It has limped along ever since. The AFL-CIO reported this year that the nation’s 8 million workplaces are policed by only 1,838 inspectors with OSHA or its state counterparts; on average, a state inspector can get to a job site once every 99 years, and a federal inspector once every 159 years. The median fine for killing a worker in America is $6,500, the price of a decent but high-mileage used car. This is not to say the law has been without benefit. When Richard Nixon signed the OSHA legislation four days after Christmas in 1970, some 14,000 workers were dying on the job each year. That number dipped as low as 4,551 in 2009, but is climbing again. Jarring deaths like Jim Spencer’s get most of the attention — to the extent attention is paid at all — but tens of thousands more workers annually suffer non-fatal injuries and illnesses that can debilitate or kill. Attempts to strengthen the act’s criminal provisions have failed in six consecutive sessions of Congress, and almost certainly will fail in this one due to deep-rooted opposition from corporate interests and their lawmaker allies. When they are feeling especially frustrated, worker advocates like to point out that one can get more time behind bars for killing an endangered animal (up to one year in prison) than for enabling conditions leading to the death of a worker (six months in jail, maximum). The example has become depressingly rote at congressional hearings and press conferences. That doesn’t make it any less true.  Minatare, Nebraska, is a High Plains cattle town of 800 or so people, 44 miles southwest of Alliance and 33 miles east of the Wyoming line. It has seen better days; Main Street is almost bereft of commerce, having lost its only grocery store in 2016. A mile to the north, a once-busy truck stop on U.S. Highway 26 has been abandoned, the property for sale. On the town’s southern fringe lies an economic bright spot: Silver Spur Feeders, a feedlot known for the impressive statue of a Black Angus steer at its entrance and the sometimes unpleasant odors it produces.  Cheryl and Jim Spencer moved to Minatare soon after they were married in May 1976. Cheryl already had a daughter, Christina, by this point, the progeny of a short and unhappy marriage at 17. Jim legally adopted Christina, and he and Cheryl had another daughter, Danielle, in 1977. In their early years together, the family occupied what Cheryl calls “a little, dinky house” at 512 Second Ave., relocating to a bigger place a block away in 1990. Cheryl still lives there with a miniature Australian shepherd named Ammo and eight cats.  An only child, Cheryl was raised by a single mother who cleaned motels and nursing homes for a living. The two of them moved from house to house in Scottsbluff, a city of 15,000 about 10 miles northwest of Minatare; Gering, which borders Scottsbluff; and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Jim, his sister and two brothers grew up in North Platte, 178 miles southeast of Scottsbluff. His father, a plumber, owned a junkyard; Jim and his brothers would help demolish the wrecked cars and cull the scrap metal for sale. They went out on plumbing and roofing jobs and learned how to operate a backhoe and other construction equipment.  By the time Cheryl met him — during a brief, unhappy stay in North Platte with another man, an episode she prefers not to discuss — “there wasn’t much Jim couldn’t do,” she says. He was 6 feet 2 inches tall, with big hands and broad shoulders. “He was kind of like a big, old teddy bear,” Cheryl says. “There was such a soft side to him.” He carried hard candy in his pocket to hand out to children. If a dog wandered up to a job site during lunch, he’d share his food.  Cheryl was a stay-at-home mother during the first six years of the marriage, and then worked as a certified nursing assistant and licensed professional nurse. Jim got a job at a plumbing company and went on to work for an appliance store and the Minatare school district. He left the district in 1999 to do contract plumbing for a man named Chuck Moenning. The two grew close; it was Moenning who introduced Jim to Shaun Houchin, the owner of Clau-Chin Construction. A passionate outdoorsman, Jim taught Cheryl and the girls how to fish and shoot. In the fall, the family hunted deer, mostly in the Wildcat Hills of Banner County, south of Scottsbluff. In the summer, they fished at Lake Minatare and on the North Platte River. Danielle was her father’s shadow — a “tomboy,” in her mother’s words, who shot skillfully and accompanied Jim on jobs. Christina was more insular, preferring baking and other homebound pursuits to hunting trips. She’d go along, Cheryl says, but refused to kill anything.  Jim garnered a reputation for reliability and conviviality. Tom and Jan Scripter, now in their 80s, frequently hired him to work on rental houses they owned in Scottsbluff and Gering. They grew so fond of him that he was given unlimited access to four fish-stocked sand pits on their land east of Minatare. “Jim never lacked for something to say,” says Tom Scripter, a retired Mutual of Omaha district manager. “He was darned good at his job.”  By early last year, decades of hard labor had taken their toll, and Jim was talking about retirement. “About one more year and I’m done,” he told Cheryl not long before his death.  March 21, 2016, dawned calm and clear in western Nebraska and would warm to the mid-70s, a welcome anomaly in a part of the country that has trouble transitioning from winter to spring. Jim Spencer got up around 4 a.m. that Monday and drove an hour from Minatare to Alliance, where Clau-Chin Construction was building a house on a lot Shaun Houchin owned at 2812 Toluca Ave. Jim’s job on this day was to connect a line from a city sewer tap to the house, a task he’d performed countless times. Larry Kessler, the excavation contractor, would dig the hole in which Jim would work.  Neither Houchin nor Kessler responded to requests for comment for this article. According to a written summary of interviews conducted by OSHA investigators, on the day of the accident Jim, Houchin, Kessler and Clau-Chin foreman Mike Harvey discussed the consistency of the soil before Kessler started digging with the claw of the backhoe. Harvey said that he and Jim had talked about the dangers of trenches “many times,” and that Jim had been “nervous” about entering a 10-foot-deep hole on a job just before this one. Cheryl Spencer says her husband refused to get into that trench, forcing Houchin to find someone else.  Harvey acknowledged that “the soils out in this area of the country are unstable enough that one needs to keep the trenches as wide as possible,” the OSHA summary states. But Houchin said he did no soil testing prior to the dig and was unaware of OSHA’s trenching standard. Harvey went further, saying Clau-Chin had “never done any form of soil testing or classification before.” Kessler said he hadn’t been trained in trenching safety and didn’t know the pertinent OSHA rules.  Nonetheless, the job went forward. Kessler began digging in earnest after lunch. Jim — having asked for and received help from Houchin in the person of a young man named Seth Watson — got into the 10-foot-long furrow Kessler had cut, dropping to his knees to set the plastic sewer pipe. “Jim wasn’t in fear of being in that trench,” Kessler said in a recorded interview with OSHA investigators. (A worker’s comfort level with a job isn’t relevant under the law. It’s the employer’s responsibility to maintain a safe workplace.)  Kessler kept digging, depositing the spoil next to the hole. Sometime after 1 p.m., he sensed that someone was wrong. “The picture in my head ... was supposed to be trench with a piece of white plastic pipe sitting at the bottom of it, and that’s not what I saw,” he said in the OSHA interview. “I saw dirt. Immediately I got out of the tractor, went to the hole. And the kid put his head up. I said, ‘Where’s Jim?’ He said, ‘I don’t know.’ At that point ...  I was pretty sure I knew where Jim was. If he wasn’t where I could see him, then he was underneath the dirt.”   By his account, Kessler jumped out of the backhoe’s cab, went into the trench to try to locate Jim and called 911 on his cellphone. He re-entered the hole, “grabbed a shovel and went to digging.” Alliance police officers appeared in minutes, followed by firefighters and EMTs from the Alliance Fire Department.  Fire Chief Troy Shoemaker arrived at 1:29 p.m., nine minutes after the 911 call came in. The scene was a hive of activity. Seventeen members of the fire department, most of them volunteers, ultimately wound up there, along with three police officers. Watson, the young man who had been working in the trench with Jim, was buried only up to his knees and was quickly extricated. Jim wasn’t visible. Rescue workers stabbed carefully at the soil with their shovels to avoid hitting Jim. At 1:38 p.m., a firefighter spotted a belt loop on the back of Jim’s pants. He tied one end of a nylon strap to the loop and the other to a shovel embedded nearby. More soil was removed, and Jim was found “kind of folded in half — face down, bent at the waist,” Shoemaker says. An EMT checked Jim’s vital signs at 1:42 p.m. and found none.   Because the trench was deemed unstable, Jim’s body was left in place. A call was made to a lumber yard, and shoring materials — plywood, 4-by-4 fence posts, nails and screws — were delivered around 2:30. Cheryl Spencer, meanwhile, was on her way to Alliance with her daughter Danielle; her son-in-law, Tom Modena; and her granddaughter, Kassie, then 19. Cheryl had gotten a cryptic voicemail message from Tom about an hour earlier, while she was picking up a load of sheep manure from her friend Juanita Baker. “The girls and I are headed down,” Tom said in the message. “I’m driving.” Suspecting something had happened to Jim on the job, Cheryl called Shaun Houchin. “I said, ‘What’s going on?’ and he told me Jim was gone. By the time Ms. Baker come over, I was on the ground. I said, ‘Well, my husband’s dead.’” Baker drove Cheryl home; Tom, Danielle and Kassie arrived at about the same time. The four of them left for Alliance, having agreed to meet Houchin at Maverik Adventure’s First Stop, a convenience store and gas station. Tom drove Cheryl’s white Durango. They got to the parking lot around 2:30. Houchin and Kessler were there, Cheryl says, and urged her not to go to the job site, where recovery efforts were proceeding slowly. Cheryl wasn’t having it. Tom held the keys to the Durango, so she began walking in the general direction of Toluca Avenue, almost three miles from the store. Her granddaughter went after her and persuaded her to come back. Sometime after 3, Tom agreed to drive everyone to the site. Shoemaker, the Alliance fire chief, saw them pull up. He recognized Tom, a volunteer firefighter with whom he’d worked years earlier in Scottsbluff. “I walked across the street and talked to them a few minutes,” Shoemaker says. “Tom understood everything that was going on. Cheryl, she was fairly calm. She just wanted to be with Jim.” She and the others were standing behind the yellow tape when the recovery workers finally carried Jim out of the hole on a backboard at 5:30. His face was caked with dirt; Shoemaker insisted that it be cleared before he brought Cheryl over. Once this was done, Shoemaker put his arm around Cheryl’s shoulder and guided her to the body as it was about to be loaded into the funeral home van. “Jimbo,” Cheryl remembers saying before the doors closed, “we were supposed to have another 20 years.” There are many ways to die on a job site: OSHA files are filled with macabre details from electrocutions, “caught-in-machinery” incidents and falls from great heights. Asphyxia by dirt is as bad as any. Sometimes the soil blocks the victim’s nose and mouth. “It obstructs the upper airways, and you can’t breathe,” says Dr. Roger Byard, a forensic pathologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia who has studied the phenomenon for three decades. Other times, in cases of so-called crush asphyxia, the chest is compressed by the weight of the soil, making respiration impossible. (This, Byard notes, happened with regularity to young chimney sweeps in Victorian England who lost their footing and became wedged in chimneys.) Survival time in a collapsed trench can be as little as a minute if the victim is prone when buried and there are no air pockets. Another researcher, biomedical engineer Mark Kroll, came to study crush asphyxia in a roundabout way. Kroll had been examining the deaths of crime suspects during arrests and grew curious, he says, about “the impact of a police officer putting a knee on a guy’s back” — constricting the chest. “I said, ‘Let’s just take on one simple question: How much weight on a chest does it take to acutely kill somebody?’ Nobody had the answer.” Kroll, who is on the adjunct faculty at the University of Minnesota and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, knew from the work of others that 1,000 pounds — the weight of a soda vending machine — would kill. He knew that 225 pounds wouldn’t. “I enlisted the help of some real experts,” he says, and came up with a “magic number”: 600 pounds. There’s no way to know whether that much pressure was exerted on Jim Spencer by the cave-in, which likely involved several cubic yards of soil. (One cubic yard — enough to cover a 10-foot-by-10-foot area three inches deep — can weigh up to 3,000 pounds, or as much as a small car.) “It’s conceivable there was enough force from the dirt that his chest was crushed — so that even an immediate rescue wouldn’t have helped,” Kroll says. More plausibly, the air was squeezed out of Jim, as in a “crowd-crush” episode at a soccer match or rock concert. “It would be like holding your breath,” Kroll says. “You’d get light-headed after a minute and probably pass out after two. The horrible thing to think about is, it’s not an instant death.” John Newquist figures he investigated more than 100 trench collapses during the 29 years he worked as a compliance officer in OSHA’s Aurora, Illinois, office, near Chicago. Now a private safety consultant, he remains fixated on these types of accidents and keeps a running tally of deaths and close calls. The 2016 version of Newquist’s “Excavation Safety in Review” — a slide show he uses in training classes — includes a bullet-point description of the accident that killed Jim Spencer. There are accounts of 23 others, including a cave-in that took the life of 30-year-old Donald Meyer of Belton, Missouri, in December of that year, and one that suffocated Bert Smith Jr., 36, and Ernesto Saucedo-Zapata, 26, in Boise, Idaho, in May. In his current role, Newquist sees the same practice that exasperated him as an OSHA inspector: Workers sent into 7- or 8-foot-deep trenches with no shoring, on the flawed assumption that “it’s just dirt.” In 2003, Newquist and several colleagues from the Aurora office went into the field to try to enlighten owners of plumbing companies. They engaged about 180 such firms, a high percentage of which “wanted to keep doing things the way they’d been doing it,” Newquist says. “I was stunned. Some of these people had been around 40 or 50 years.” David Michaels, who led OSHA for seven years during the Obama administration, says that “every trench fatality should be strongly considered for criminal penalties.” His former deputy, Jordan Barab, points out that the hazard was recognized millennia before OSHA existed: the historian Herodotus described how the resourceful Phoenicians — in digging the Xerxes Canal in northern Greece during the Greco-Persian Wars, beginning in 483 B.C. — kept the sides of the ditch from crumbling by making the opening wider than the bottom. And yet death by dirt continues to plague 21st-century America. What would make a difference? OSHA’s presence, for starters — a dim prospect given the agency’s deep deficits in personnel and money. Accounting for inflation, the agency’s budget has remained flat since 1980, even as the U.S. workforce has grown by 50 percent; in raw numbers, OSHA’s staff has contracted by 26 percent. This matters in the real world, as demonstrated by the case of Rick Burns, a compliance officer in OSHA’s Columbus, Ohio, office who died recently. Burns was credited with saving a life in 2011 when, while inspecting an unshored trench at least 10 feet deep, he divined an imminent collapse and ordered a worker out of the hole. Five minutes later, the hole was filled with dirt. Many small employers never see someone like Burns unless there’s an accident. Neither Shaun Houchin nor Larry Kessler had had any contact with the agency prior to the cave-in that killed Jim Spencer. Publicity — of the negative sort — also helps. When they were at OSHA, Michaels and Barab made it a point to issue a press release on any enforcement case with a proposed penalty of $40,000 or more; the previous cutoff had been $70,000. They’d also highlight certain problems — heat-related deaths, workplace violence — regardless of the dollar amount involved. The message to workers, Barab says, was, “Hey, I don’t have to put up with this. This is not an acceptable condition and I can call OSHA.”  Anecdotal evidence suggests the shaming worked. Michaels, now teaching at George Washington University, and Barab, a consultant and author of the “Confined Space” newsletter, both say they heard from company lawyers whose clients worried more about seeing their names in OSHA press releases than about being fined. Matthew Johnson, a research scientist at Duke University, says his own work shows that the releases — often cited in local newspapers and trade journals — have a measurable impact. He found that once an employer had been publicly reproached, OSHA violations by similar businesses within a three-mile radius fell 75 percent in the ensuing three years. “Even if I look at 20 miles out, this effect stays very strong,” says Johnson, an economist whose paper on the subject is undergoing peer review. A Labor Department spokeswoman declined to answer questions about the Trump administration’s press release policy. At his confirmation hearing last week, Scott Mugno, the administration’s nominee to lead OSHA, said he’d consult with department officials on the topic if he won the position. Congress has been loath to adjust the law that underpins OSHA, though in two steps since August 2016 it raised the maximum civil penalty for a “serious” violation from $7,000 to $12,675, and for a “willful” violation from $70,000 to $126,749. Attempts to increase criminal penalties have fallen flat. They failed even in 2010, when Democrats last controlled both houses and the third iteration of the Protecting America’s Workers Act was introduced. The bill met stiff resistance from business groups; a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, argued at a hearing that “a few outlier employers” were skewing the picture and tougher sanctions were counterproductive. The argument prevailed. Despite this setback and subsequent ones, on Feb. 7 of this year — the seventh anniversary of a fatal explosion at a construction site in his district — Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) tried again. Like its predecessors, version seven of the act would authorize felony charges against an employer whose knowing recklessness led to a worker death or maiming. As things stand, the most egregious case of neglect under the worker-safety law is, at worst, a misdemeanor. This, Courtney says, “sends a terrible message about the value of workers’ lives.” Courtney understands that the legislation faces long odds. He uses as motivation the memory of a ground-shaking blast in 2010 at the Kleen Energy power plant in Middletown, Connecticut, which killed six workers and injured 50. Among the dead was a friend of the congressman’s, Ron Crabb. The workers had been blowing debris out of pipes with natural gas; the gas, predictably, found an ignition source. In a settlement with OSHA, the contractor that oversaw the practice, Keystone Construction and Maintenance, wound up paying $226,260, or less than 4 percent of the $6.7 million penalty the agency initially proposed against it. No one went to jail. “It certainly heightened my feelings about how important it is to pass this law,” Courtney says. Officers and directors of corporations — that is to say, people, not faceless entities — could be held criminally liable under his bill. Asked to characterize Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s position on the matter, the department spokeswoman demurred. Jim Spencer’s ashes were buried at East Lawn Cemetery in Minatare on March 25, 2016, a cold, blustery Friday. Cheryl had prepared Jim for cremation by removing the shirt he’d worn the day of the accident — torn or cut, she couldn’t tell — and cleaning his face. She combed his hair and beard, and put on a hat and a fishing-themed shirt Kassie had given him. His work boots and jeans were left intact. Troy Shoemaker, the Alliance fire chief, came to the graveside service. So did Tom and Jan Scripter — though Tom, hobbled by cancer and other ailments, stayed in the car to avoid the biting wind. Shaun Houchin was there — as was Larry Kessler, fellow mourners told Cheryl, who didn’t see him. “Even the lady who worked at the co-op [in Alliance] was across from me,” Cheryl says. “She came because Jim would stop there every morning.” Shoemaker says Jim’s death has stayed with him. “I struggle with this one more than any other call in the 28 years I’ve been doing this,” he says. The day after the cave-in, everyone with the fire department who had tried to save Jim attended a group debriefing with first responders from other parts of the state, a setting meant to be comforting and cathartic. Shoemaker had arranged the session and planned to maintain his usual air of solemn detachment, but he succumbed to emotion. “I broke down in that debriefing,” he says. His reaction, he suspects, was triggered in part by his own father’s sudden death of a heart attack at 54. “Jim was Cheryl’s world,” Shoemaker says. “My dad was the same to my mom.” In late August, at a visitor’s request, Cheryl retraced the route her son-in-law took the day her husband died: East on U.S. 26, north on U.S. 385. Parallel to the latter, freight trains carrying Wyoming coal rumbled south from the BNSF rail yard in Alliance. Sunflowers bloomed on the side of the road. Cheryl — a red-haired, no-nonsense woman of 62 — pulled into the parking lot at Maverik, the convenience store where she met Shaun Houchin and Larry Kessler the day everything came apart. (She has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against both, but stays in touch, somewhat awkwardly, with Houchin, who saw Jim as a father figure). She next drove to the house at 2812 Toluca Ave., where, for reasons unknown, a tree she and Houchin had chosen in Jim’s memory was not planted. In its stead is the little evergreen, which grows a few feet above where Jim had been laying pipe. On the way back to Minatare, passing barns shredded by a spring tornado, Cheryl described the essence of Jim: Early riser. Inveterate teaser and storyteller. Tinkerer. “Whatever he wanted, he made it, really,” she said. “He could fabricate anything. He could weld. He could take an engine apart, rebuild it. He made a log splitter that would probably have cost $2,000 to buy.” From time to time, Jim would ask Cheryl if she’d checked the oil in the Durango. “No, why?” she’d respond. “That’s why I’ve got you.” The Center for Public Integrity is a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Father Of Slain Parkland Teen Wants Trump To Say His Son’s Name,"DALLAS ― The father of a student slain in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting challenged President Donald Trump to visit his home and see his dead son’s bedroom.  “I haven’t heard from President Trump the name of my son, not even once,” said Manuel Oliver, speaking during a student-led rally outside City Hall in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday morning. Hundreds of activists and students gathered to protest the National Rifle Association, which is holding its annual meeting nearby.  “It takes one second ― ‘Joaquin Oliver’ ― and you are not able to mention that name,” he said, addressing Trump directly. “It is important, your support, because you could make things happen along with us. Let me rephrase that: You could make it happen faster, because we are going to make it happen.” Oliver’s son, Joaquin, was fatally shot alongside 16 other people during the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The survivors of that tragedy, one of the deadliest school shootings in modern U.S. history, have now emerged as leaders of a freshly invigorated national gun control movement, which has set its sights on the NRA. Oliver live-painted a protest mural in honor of his son, between speeches by gun control activists and students. At the end, he walked onto the stage with a hammer.  “Let’s feel how it feels to be in a school hall and listen to something like this,” he said, before loudly smashing holes in 17 stick figures illustrated on the giant canvas. He then stuck a sunflower through each one.   Manuel Oliver makes a protest mural in memory of his son https://t.co/FHPmxCZtWS Just a block away from the protest, thousands of members of the country’s most powerful gun group strolled inside the Kay Hutchison Convention Center, shopping the NRA store, taking seminars and perusing “15 acres of guns and gear” inside the exhibit hall. The annual convention, now in its 147th year, comes at a particularly tense moment for the NRA. This year’s theme is “a show of strength,” and the NRA appears to be in a defensive posture. In a speech on Friday, the group’s chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, urged members not to be ashamed.  “What they really want is for you to be afraid to publicly associate with this organization,” he said. “They don’t want you wearing an NRA hat or putting an NRA sticker on your car or truck.”  He encouraged attendees to stand tall and “stand proud.” Trump and Vice President Mike Pence spoke to members on Friday inside a packed area. Both leaders advocated arming teachers and increasing security in schools to protect children.  Outside City Hall, Rosie Wallace, 29, and Kenna Edwards, 25, said they came to the protest because they want to see fewer school shootings and more common-sense gun reform. They both admired Oliver’s mural.  “It’s really moving that someone would be so expressive about losing their child and willing to sacrifice their time to make a change for something they believe in,” said Wallace, an environmental scientist for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Edwards, who works at a software company, said she was disappointed in Dallas for allowing the NRA convention to be held there. “It’s on-brand for Dallas, but as a resident, I don’t like it,” she said.  Julia Heilrayne, an Austin, Texas, high school student, attended the protest with a red target printed on her forehead. She spoke with HuffPost at a smaller protest in front of City Hall the night before. Since the Parkland shooting, she said, students at her school are skittish if they hear a loud noise, like a chip bag popping in the cafeteria.   “You can drop a textbook in the hallway, and everyone freezes,” she said.  Heilrayne said she got involved in the gun control movement after a friend of hers ― a third-grader ― was shot and killed in 2017.  “I had to fight for her,” she said. “I had to be her voice, because she doesn’t have one any more.” After the gun control protest wrapped up, a group of counterprotesters gathered nearby openly carrying firearms. Lawrence Solem, 40, a machinery mechanic from Lewisville, Texas, said he wanted to show his support for the right to carry. “Evil can and always will exist in the world,” he said. “Evil doesn’t care about time or location. That’s why it’s safest to carry at all times.”",POLITICS,POLITICS
Thousands Of Snowballs Appear On A Siberian Beach,"At first glance, the circular objects in the image above might seem like Jurassic Park dino eggs, or alien pods ready to hatch and wreak havoc on the world. But it’s really sort of a kid’s dream come true ― and maybe some adults, too. Imagine waking up one day to the sight of thousands of snowballs scattered on the beach near where you live. How long would it take you to find yourself in the middle of the best-ever snowball fight? That was the sight that greeted residents of Nyda, a village near the Arctic Circle in northwest Siberia at the end of October. The cold spheres ― stretching 11 miles along the coast ― ranged in size from a tennis ball to nearly 3 feet across, according to The Siberian Times. “We were all very surprised,” one local citizen told the paper. “Many people believed it only when [they] saw with their own eyes. This has not happened previously. And there was not so much snow for them to form. It’s so interesting.” A village administrator, Valery Akulov, offered a natural explanation to local media. “When the water in the gulf rose, it came into contact with the frost. The beach began to be covered with ice. Then the water began to slowly retreat, and the ice remained. Its pieces were rolling over in the wet sand and turned into these balls,” Akulov said. The BBC reports the circular objects “result from a rare environmental process where small pieces of ice form, are rolled by wind and water, and end up as giant snowballs.” This oddity of nature has cropped up before. In 2010, floating ice spheres were seen near South Haven, Michigan, at the Great Lake: Three years later, more ice balls were spotted along the shore of Lake Michigan in 2013, and still again, in 2015, Lake Michigan was the target of many frozen circular boulders, as seen in the following video: So, if you happen to plan a winter vacation in Siberia, or even closer on Lake Michigan, don’t forget to bring your gloves and dress warmly. ",SCIENCE,ENVIRONMENT
"Devin Nunes, Fundraising Off FBI Attacks, Tells Potential Donors That Trump Says He's A Hero","WASHINGTON ― House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is continuing to raise campaign funds off of his defense of President Donald Trump, using a fundraising letter to tout a tweet in which Trump described him as a “Great American Hero” because of Nunes’ work undermining the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In the letter, Nunes writes that he’s “standing strong” with Trump and asks for a donation to “take the fight to the liberals.” He writes that he “exposed the real collusion between the Department of Justice, the F.B.I. and the Clinton campaign” through his work as House intelligence committee chairman. “When Barack Obama’s Department of Justice and the F.B.I. used Hillary Clinton’s patently false opposition research to justify a warrant to spy on associates of the Trump campaign, I exposed the scandal and brought it to the attention of the entire nation,” Nunes wrote. The top of a fundraising letter sent to an individual in Virginia, which was obtained by HuffPost, promotes a tweet Trump sent about Nunes’ work: That tweet was sent after Nunes appeared on “Fox & Friends” in February, when Nunes falsely said the president had never met with George Papadopoulos, the former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is working with special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Nunes says in his letter that he has “earned the hatred of revenge-driven members of the Democratic leadership cabal and the Far Left media.” He said he has faced an “onslaught of lies, propaganda, attacks, slurs and smears,” that Democrats had “come unhinged” in their attacks on him and that he was up against “liars, propagandists and hypocrites from the Far Left fringe.” Nunes’ campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.  In November’s midterm election, Nunes faces Democrat Andrew Janz, a deputy district attorney in Fresno County who raised more than $1 million in the first quarter, much of it from Democrats upset over the so-called Nunes memo and his attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. The final report from Nunes’ committee released last month attempted to clear Trump of wrongdoing. “It’s clear my opponent is only interested in pleasing the President,” Janz told HuffPost in a statement. “He takes great satisfaction in voting against our interests and stands by devastating tariffs placed on our farmers to serve Trump and his billionaire buddies. There’s nothing heroic about that.”  Nunes’ seat in the House no longer considered a “safe Republican” seat, according to Sabato’s Crystal Ball. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist with the Swamp Accountability Project, a group that is running ads against Nunes, called the letter “mostly a political stunt undertaken to beef up direct mail appeals to rich Beltway donors to try to help him get through a tough cycle in which he faces a potentially viable opponent for the first time in a long time” “Nunes is positioning as an opponent of the ‘Deep State’ as a matter of political convenience because a Democrat has made his district potentially competitive, and Nunes is not well-liked among California conservatives— another reason why he has to ask for money in Virginia,” she said.  This article has been updated with comment from Mair.  Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

Barack Obama Reveals Which NBA Team He'd Want To Play For,"Barack Obama, the basketball-loving former president, said this week he’d play for the San Antonio Spurs if he were an All-Star free agent in the NBA. The declaration prompted a funny response on Wednesday from Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich. At an MIT Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Obama said that as a player he would seek out the five-time champion Spurs because they satisfy his checklist for ideal organizations. “They’re smart, they’re well-run, they’re focused on team,” he said (listen in the sound clip below). “They treat everybody in the organization with respect, and that is the kind of organization that I want to be a part of. So I would say that over the last 15 years in basketball, San Antonio would be a great example of that.” “If you look at what they’ve built,” he continued, “it’s just a smart, well-run operation with a good culture.”  Obama’s shoutout did not go unnoticed by the Spurs’ coach, who happens to be a critic of President Donald Trump and a socially conscious fellow. He also has a sense of humor. “That’s very flattering,” Popovich said, according to the Bay Area News Group. “I’d have to do a background check on him, though, because I’ve heard some things he’s done in the past aren’t very good. I can’t remember where I heard that stuff, but I’d have to do a background check.” Obama’s Spurs comments begin at the 46:35 mark below. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Floyd Mayweather Retires With Perfect 50-0 Record: 'Tonight Was My Last Fight',"After defeating UFC champ Conor McGregor during their much-hyped Saturday night fight in Las Vegas, undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. said he was hanging up his gloves — “for sure” this time.  “This was my last fight tonight. For sure. Tonight was my last fight,” Mayweather, 40, said at the conclusion of the unexpectedly competitive bout, according to Rolling Stone. “Tonight I chose the right dance partner to dance with. Conor, you are a hell of a champion.”  McGregor, who had never fought in a professional boxing match until Saturday, had surprised — and impressed — fans and pundits with his strong showing early on in the fight. The mixed martial arts fighter, however, started to languish as the bout drew on. Mayweather won by technical knockout in the 10th round. The win means the boxer, who earned at least $100 million from Saturday’s fight, will retire with a 50-0  professional record. As SB Nation notes, this isn’t the first time Mayweather has retired, having done so twice before — first in 2007 and then in 2015. Mayweather insists this time’s the real deal, but some fans aren’t quite so convinced.  ""Tonight was my last fight for sure!"" #Mayweather said after stopping #Mcgregor tonight.

"Report: Manafort's Former Son-In-Law Cuts Plea Deal, To Cooperate With Government","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, the one-time chairman of President Donald Trump’s campaign, has cut a plea deal with the Justice Department that requires him to cooperate with other criminal probes, two people with knowledge of the matter said.    The guilty plea agreement, which is under seal and has not been previously reported, could add to the legal pressure on Manafort, who is facing two indictments brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort has been indicted in federal courts in Washington and Virginia with charges ranging from tax evasion to bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.     Jeffrey Yohai, a former business partner of Manafort, was divorced from Manafort’s daughter last August. Yohai has not been specifically told how he will be called on to cooperate as part of his plea agreement, but the two people familiar with the matter say they consider it a possibility that he will be asked to assist with Mueller’s prosecution of Manafort. Legal experts have said that Mueller wants to keep applying pressure on Manafort to plead guilty and assist prosecutors with their probe. Manafort chaired the Trump campaign for three months before resigning in August 2016. Both Trump and Russia have denied allegations they colluded to help Republican Trump win the election. Hilary Potashner, a public defender who is representing Yohai, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Manafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, declined to comment. Andrew Brown, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, had been overseeing an investigation into Yohai’s real estate and bank dealings in California and New York several months before Mueller was appointed to his post in May 2017. Yohai’s agreement, which was concluded early this year, included him pleading guilty to misusing construction loan funds and to a count related to a bank account overdraft.     While the deal was cut with Brown’s office, the federal government “can ask for help at any time,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Brown did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.         Manafort is to go on trial later this year to fight the two indictments. The charges against him range from failing to disclose lobbying work for a pro-Russian Ukrainian political party to bank fraud. As a close business partner, Yohai was privy to many of Manafort’s financial dealings, according to the two people familiar with the matter and court filings in the bankruptcies of four Los Angeles properties in 2016. In addition to co-investing in California real estate, the two cooperated in getting loans for property deals in New York, Manafort’s indictments show. Mueller sent a team of prosecutors to interview Yohai last June, asking him about Manafort’s relationship with Trump, his ties to Russian oligarchs, and his borrowing of tens of millions of dollars against properties in New York, Reuters reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter.",POLITICS,POLITICS

This Is The Surreal Way That Whales Sleep,"Toddlers get a lot of credit for being able to fall asleep anywhere. But, whales (and other marine mammals) might have them beat. The humpback whale in this video demonstrates how whales, dolphins and porpoises actually snooze -- suspended completely vertically in the water. The video, filmed off the Turks and Caicos Islands, was published by YouTube user URZALA prod.  The animal's sleep position may not look as comfortable as going supine on your pillow top queen, but for mammals that live in the water, sleeping up near the surface is about survival. ""They need to be close enough to breathe easily during sleep,"" Paul Manger, a neuroethologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told The Huffington Post. Whales, dolphins and other mammals that live in the water get the oxygen they need from the air. They ""breathe"" through the blowholes on the tops of their heads. So, the animals need to come to the water's surface both when they are awake and during sleep. Observing large groups of whales can be difficult, especially in the wild. But scientists who've observed some species say it's common for them to sleep in a suspended vertical position or a suspended horizontal position. But what really makes whales sleep pros is their ability to sleep with only half their brain at a time. ""When whales and dolphins sleep, only half the brain is asleep at any one time with the other half being awake,"" Manger explained. Scientists suspect whales, dolphins and other water-dwelling mammals sleep like this for a lot of reasons, including to monitor breathing, to keep an eye out for potential predators and to conserve body heat and avoid hypothermia (since mammals lose body temperature during sleep). However, in one study, researchers captured footage of whales sleeping in the wild that showed they may sometimes sleep with both sides of their brain. The whales appeared to be totally asleep about 7 percent of the time -- less than two hours a day. ""While there are good ideas about why whales and dolphins sleep the way they do, none of these are, as yet, fully proven,"" Manger said. Still, this video proves whales are pretty zen sleepers.

Tesla CEO Touts Safety Of Self-Driving Cars,"Tesla Motors' semi-autonomous driving system, Autopilot, reduces the likelihood of getting in an accident by 50 percent, according to company CEO Elon Musk.  Musk made the announcement at a conference in Norway last week, where he also hinted that the electric carmaker was developing a new type of driverless vehicle, according to tech blog Electrek. Tesla rolled out Autopilot in 2015. The system helps drivers steer, switch lanes and park. Tesla owners have driven nearly 50 million miles using Autopilot, and early data suggest drivers are a lot less likely to get in a wreck when they use the system, according to Musk. “We can see basically what’s the average number of kilometers to an accident – accident defined by airbag deployment,"" Musk said. ""Even with this early version, it’s almost twice as good as a person.” An airbag deploying doesn't necessarily mean an accident happened, however. And it's still not entirely clear what methodology Tesla used to arrive at these figures. But if Autopilot is as effective as Musk says, the technology's early success could help persuade regulators to approve Tesla's plans for a fully autonomous vehicle in the near future, said Musk.  “I think it’s going to be important in term of satisfying regulators and the public to show statistically with a large amount of data – with billions of kilometers of driving – to say that the safety level is definitively better, by a meaningful margin, if it’s autonomous versus non-autonomous,” Musk told conference attendees. Tesla is expected to debut its first fully autonomous car within two years. While driverless vehicles still frighten some people, they tend to be pretty safe. In over 1.4 million miles of test driving, Google's self-driving car has found itself in only a handful of minor accidents. Just one of those accidents, a low-speed fender bender in February, was caused by Google's car.  For autonomous vehicles, the real safety concern is other drivers. The vast majority of road accidents are caused by human error, and even the smartest machines can't always predict the other drivers' behavior. The best way to cut down on car accidents might be to get rid of human drivers altogether. ",TECH,TECH
Facial expressions are key to first impressions. What does that mean for people with facial paralysis?,"Facial expressions may be a universal language. Where does that leave people with facial paralysis? Icerko Lýdia via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY
By Kathleen Bogart, Oregon State University Facial expressions are important parts of how we communicate and how we develop impressions of the people around us. In ""The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals,"" Charles Darwin proposed that facial expressions evolved to quickly communicate emotional states important to social survival. He hypothesized that certain facial expressions are innate, and therefore universally expressed and recognized across all cultures. In 1971, psychology researchers Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen tested Darwin's hypothesis. They enlisted members of the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea, who at the time had little contact with Western culture, to do an emotion recognition task. An interpreter read stories about emotional events to members of the tribe, such as ""her child has died, and she feels very sad."" The Fore were then asked to match photos of Americans' facial expressions to the story. The researchers also took photos of the facial expressions of the Fore people and showed them to Americans later. People from both cultures showed the same facial expressions for six ""basic"" emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) and were able to recognize their meaning in others. This is strong evidence that certain emotions are evolutionarily based. In the decades since, research has continued to support Darwin's hypothesis: for instance, showing that congenitally blind people display the same spontaneous expressions as sighted people. Indeed, facial expression may be one of the only universal languages. So where does that leave people with facial paralysis? As a psychology professor with Moebius syndrome, a condition involving facial paralysis, I'm personally and professionally interested in what happens when the face is no longer the primary means of expression. My Disability and Social Interaction Lab at Oregon State University has been investigating this question. 


Kathleen Bogart's Disability and Social Interaction Lab presenting research about Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day.
Author provided

  Each year, approximately 225,000 Americans are diagnosed with facial paralysis. It can be congenital, like Moebius syndrome or hereditary facial paralysis. It can also result from birth trauma if the facial nerve is damaged in the birth canal or by forceps delivery. Acquired facial paralysis from an illness or an injury is far more common. Bell's palsy, acoustic neuroma, Lyme disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, ear infections, injury to the facial nerve and others can all lead to facial paralysis. Bell's palsy, which typically affects one side of the face, is the most common. While it's usually temporary, approximately 15 percent of people with Bell's are left with paralysis that does not improve. In a series of published and unpublished focus groups and interviews, my colleagues and I found that people with facial paralysis reported hearing all sorts of ""interpretations"" of their appearance. Strangers asked them if they had just gotten a Novocain shot, if they were having a stroke, or if the condition was contagious, deadly or painful. Some people made connections to the person's character, assuming them to be unfriendly, unhappy or even intellectually disabled.  In landmark research published in 1993, psychologists Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal asked strangers to view short (six- to 30-second) silent video clips of high school and college teachers while they were teaching. The strangers then rated their impressions of the teachers' personalities, based on their nonverbal behaviors - things like expressions and gestures. Today this sort of research using very short experiences to form judgments of individual behavior is called thin slice research. The strangers' ratings were remarkably similar to teaching effectiveness ratings from the teachers' students and their supervisors who knew them and their work very well. Our social world has an overwhelming amount of information, but numerous thin slice studies suggest we can navigate it efficiently based on a ""gut"" reaction. People's first impressions are surprisingly accurate in predicting many social characteristics: personality, depression, even gayness. 
 Are facial expressions learned or innate?
 While facial expressions aren't the only thing that go into a first impression, they are a pretty big element. So basing our impressions of others on their facial expressions is usually an effective strategy. However, the accuracy of impressions breaks down when people encounter someone with facial paralysis. At first glance, a person with a paralyzed face may look unfriendly, bored, unintelligent, or even depressed. And indeed, people with facial paralysis are often mistakenly ascribed these characteristics.  My own research has found that many people with facial paralysis increase expression in their bodies and voices, something I call ""compensatory expression."" In a 2012 study my colleagues and I video-recorded interviews with 27 people with different types of facial paralysis. Research assistants (who were unaware of our hypotheses) watched the interviews and rated the vocal and bodily expressivity of the people with facial paralysis. Interestingly, we found that people with congenital facial paralysis, like Moebius syndrome, used significantly more compensatory expression than people with acquired facial paralysis. For instance, they used more emotion words, vocal inflection, laughter, gestures and head and body movements. They were also louder and more talkative. It's possible that people with congenital facial paralysis are better adapted, perhaps because they navigated early developmental milestones with facial paralysis. People who acquired facial paralysis after birth, but have lived with it for a long time, may also adapt well. However, our early data suggest that there may be a unique adaptation advantage for people with congenital conditions. 


Facial expressions aren't the only way people communicate.

  Facial expressions play such a critical role in forming first impressions, so what does that mean for people with facial paralysis? In a series of experiments, we showed thin slice videos of people with disorders that affect facial movement, including facial paralysis and Parkinson's disease to strangers. We asked the strangers for their first impressions based on the videos. People with severe facial movement impairment were rated as less happy and sociable compared to people with mild facial movement impairment. Participants also had less desire to form friendships with them. Our results across these studies have found that there is a very large bias against people with facial movement disorders. Crucially, participants rated people with facial paralysis who use a lot of compensatory expression as happier and more sociable than those who use less, regardless of the severity of their paralysis. We are developing communication skills workshops encouraging the use of compensatory expression for people with facial paralysis. In another thin slice study, Linda Tickle-Degnen along with Kathleen Lyons found that even clinicians with expertise in facial movement disorders viewed people with facial movement impairment in negative ways. This indicates how hard it is to override the natural human tendency to form impressions based on the face. And for clinicians, it is of special concern. Their facial expression bias may be a barrier to rapport or even clinical judgments of depression and pain in patients with facial paralysis.  In a recent experiment, we found initial evidence that raising awareness improves how people perceive facial paralysis. Some participants read a few educational paragraphs about facial paralysis (much like the information in this article), and some were not given any information about facial paralysis. Next, all participants watched thin slice videos of people with facial paralysis. The participants who read the educational information rated people with facial paralysis as more sociable than those who did not read the information. We are continuing to develop educational materials for clinicians and the general public to raise awareness and reduce bias. In our focus groups, the most common comment from people with facial paralysis was a call for greater public awareness. They know firsthand that people are confused by their facial difference. They often wonder if they should explain it to others, but to do so every time they meet someone new would be awkward and burdensome. Widespread awareness would reduce the need to explain their condition, and would educate others to pay attention to the compensatory tactics they use to communicate their emotions.

'Stormy Daniels Day' Declared In West Hollywood As Adult Star Gets Key To City,"President Donald Trump just got one more reason not to visit this Southern California city. West Hollywood ― which has continuously gone out of its way to denounce Trump ― presented adult film star Stormy Daniels with the key to the city on Wednesday while proclaiming the day “Stormy Daniels Day.” Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was honored for “her leadership in the #RESIST movement” ― in particular for being a “national figure in the resistance to the Trump Administration,” the city said in a statement. “In these politically tumultuous times, Daniels has proven herself to be a profile in courage by speaking truth to power even under threats to her safety and extreme intimidation,” the statement read. The 39-year-old actress and director, who was recognized at the Santa Monica Boulevard sex shop Chi Chi LaRue’s, won national fame after alleging that she’d had an affair with Trump in 2006. Daniels has continued to tell her story, though she said someone threatened her over it. In a tweet leading up to Wednesday’s event, West Hollywood Mayor John Duran shared that “right-wing hate mail is pouring in” over his city’s decision to recognize Daniels. It “tells me I am doing something right!” he tweeted. Haha! Giving the key to the City to @StormyDaniels today & the right wing hate mail is pouring in. Been doing LGBT rights for over 30 years.  Right wing hate mail is the compass that tells me I am doing something right! Happy Stormy Daniels Day! #StormyDaniels #Resisters #WeHo West Hollywood, also known as WeHo, has been frosty to Trump for some time. In 2016, its then-Mayor Lindsey Horvath wrote a letter to the then-presidential candidate, informing him that his “campaign of violence and intimidation is not welcome in our city.” “I demand that you renounce calls to violence and consider the role you play in shaping public discourse, specifically with the words you choose and the behavior you exhibit and encourage,” Horvath stated. “We do not have to agree or like one another, but as Americans and political figures in the public eye, we share a responsibility to lead by example.” In June 2017, West Hollywood’s City Council also passed a resolution that called on the U.S. House of Representatives to begin initiating Trump’s impeachment. The resolution cited a number of reasons, including his revenue from his businesses both in the U.S. and abroad; his refusal to release his tax returns; nepotism; concerns about collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice with the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Obama's Keystone XL Trade-Off: Executive Order Expediting Everything Else,"Large segments of the environmental movement declared a win on Jan. 18, 2012, the dawn of an election year in which partisan fervor reigned supreme. On that day President Barack Obama kicked the can down the road for permitting TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline's northern half until after the then-forthcoming November 2012 presidential election. ""Northern half"" is the key caveat: just two months later, on March 22, 2012 -- even deeper into the weeds of an election year -- President Obama issued Executive Order 13604. Among other key things, the order has an accompanying memorandum calling for an expedited review of the southern half of Keystone XL stretching from Cushing, Okla. to Port Arthur, Texas. The day before, March 21, Obama flew on Air Force One to a pipe yard in Cushing -- the ""pipeline crossroads of the world"" -- for a special stump speech and photo-op announcing the executive order and memorandum. Dubbed the Gulf Coast Pipeline Project by TransCanada --  95 percent complete and ""open for business"" in the first quarter of 2014 -- the 485-mile tube will ship 700,000 barrels of tar sands crude per day from Cushing to Port Arthur, where it will then reach Gulf Coast refineries and be exported to the global market. It will eventually have the capacity to ship 830,000 barrels per day. The subject of a large amount of grassroots resistance from groups such as Great Plains Tar Sands Resistance and the Tar Sands Blockade, the Gulf Coast Pipeline Project -- when push comes to shove -- is only the tip of the iceberg. That's because Obama's order also called for expedited permitting and review of all domestic infrastructure projects -- including but not limited to pipelines -- as a reaction to the Keystone XL resistance. A months-long Mint Press News investigation reveals the executive order wasn't merely a symbolic gesture. Rather, many key pipeline and oil and gas industry marketing projects are currently up for expedited review, making up for -- and by far eclipsing -- the capacity of Keystone XL's northern half. The original TransCanada Keystone pipeline -- as is -- already directly connects to Cushing from Alberta, making XL (short for ""extension line"") essentially obsolete. Keystone XL's northern half proposal is key for marketing oil obtained from the controversial hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") process in North Dakota's Bakken Shale basin. Dubbed the Bakken Marketlink Pipeline, the segment has lost its importance with the explosive freight rail boom for moving Bakken fracked oil to market and other pipeline proposals. One of those pipelines, in fact, has received fast-track approval under the March 2012 Obama Executive Order. Feeling the pressure from protest against the Keystone XL from groups such as the Tar Sands Action, Indigenous Environmental Network and others, Obama pulled a fast one: ""wait and see"" for XL's northern half -- which many claimed as a victory -- and expedited approval of everything else via executive order. Obama's Keystone XL southern half March 2012 memo reads like Big Oil talking points. ""[W]e need an energy infrastructure system that can keep pace with advances in production,"" Obama states in the Memo. ""To promote American energy sources, we must not only extract oil -- we must also be able to transport it to our world-class refineries, and ultimately to consumers."" A metaphorical slap in the face to environmentalists who spent months working on opposing Keystone XL, Obama argued a more efficient, less bureaucratic means of approval was compulsory. ""[A]s part of my Administration's broader efforts to improve the performance of Federal permitting and review processes, we must make pipeline infrastructure a priority ... supporting projects that can contribute to economic growth and a secure energy future,"" the memo reads. Though the order issued an expedited permitting process for Keystone XL's southern half, it also foreshadowed that expedited permitting would become the ""new normal"" going forward for all domestic oil and gas pipeline projects. ""To address the existing bottleneck in Cushing, as well as other current or anticipated bottlenecks, agencies shall ... coordinate and expedite their reviews ... as necessary to expedite decisions related to domestic pipeline infrastructure projects that would contribute to a more efficient domestic pipeline system for the transportation of crude oil,"" the memo states in closing. The memo also notes all projects placed in the expedited permitting pile can have their statuses tracked on the online Federal Infrastructure Projects Dashboard, with 48 projects currently listed. Little time was wasted building the XL's southern half after Obama issued the Order and within a slim two years, TransCanada will have its first direct line from Alberta to Gulf Coast refineries in southern Texas. It's not as if the Keystone XL southern half expedited permit has gone unopposed. It's just that activists who have chosen to resist the pipeline have paid a heavy price for doing so. A case in point: opposition to Keystone XL's southern half has earned many activists the label -- on multiple occasions -- as potential ""eco-terrorists,"" named as such by TransCanada, the U.S. FBI and Department of Homeland Security's Nebraska-based ""fusion center"" and local undercover police. Other activists were threatened by TransCanada with a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP), all of whom made an out of court settlement in January 2013. Activists agreed to ""no longer trespass or cause damage to Keystone XL property including the easements within private property boundaries,"" explained FireDogLake's Kevin Gosztola in a January 2013 article. The agreement was a quintessential ""lesser of two evils"" choice, given activists could have found themselves bogged down in legal fees from TransCanada and may have eventually owed the corporation big bucks. ""The activists had a choice: either settle or face a lawsuit in court where TransCanada would seek $5 million for alleged financial damages ... that could have much worse consequences,"" Gosztola further explained. Beyond SLAPP threats, key lawsuits aiming to fend off TransCanada have also failed. One of those lawsuits in particular --  filed on April 25, 2013 by a Douglass, Texas-based citizen namedMichael Bishop representing himself in court -- paints a picture of what President Obama meant when he said he would fast-track permitting for infrastructure projects going forward. Before filing the lawsuit, Bishop penned a four-part series for EcoWatch in February and March of 2013 on his experiences as a landowner living a mere 120-feet from pipeline construction and dealing with TransCanada in Texas. ""I am amazed by the lack of understanding about this project by the general public and even more amazed that people in other parts of the country are so focused on the 'northern segment' while the pipeline is actually being laid right here in Texas and will begin transporting diluted bitumen, tar sands crude oil, to Gulf Coast refineries by the end of the year,"" Bishop wrote in Part III. ""So many seem oblivious to this fact."" Bishop alleges in his Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Petition for Writ of Mandamus that on-the-books bread-and-butter environmental laws were broken when fast-tracked permitting for Keystone XL's southern half unfolded. The permitting mechanism utilized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- following Obama's March 2012 executive order and memorandum -- was a Nationwide Permit 12. Nationwide Permit 12 has also been chosen for fast-tracked permitting of Enbridge's Flanagan South Pipeline. That pipeline is set to fill the gap -- and then some -- for Keystone XL's northern half, bringing tar sands crude along the 600-mile long, 600,000 barrels per day pipeline from Pontiac, Ill. to Cushing, Okla. A 2012 document produced by the Army Corps of Engineers explains Nationwide Permit 12 is meant for permitting of utility lines, access roads; foundations for overhead utility line towers, poles, and anchors: pipelines carrying corrosive tar sands crude go unmentioned. The Corps' document also explains Nationwide Permit 12 exists to ""authorize certain activities that have minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects on the aquatic environment,"" further explaining, ""Activities that result in more than minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects on the aquatic environment cannot be authorized."" Bishop cited the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), arguing Nationwide Permit 12 as applied to Keystone XL's southern half violated the spirit of that law because no environmental assessment was conducted and no public hearings were held. ""Given the fact that the Corps was involved in the preparation of the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline XL for the State Department ... knowledgeable of the toxic nature of the material to be transported and massive public opposition to the project, public hearings should have been held in accordance with the law,"" wrote Bishop. Further, the pipeline crosses ""nearly 1,000 crossings of bodies of water in Texas alone,"" according to Bishop's complaint. In following the dictates of the March 2012 executive order and memorandum, Bishop argues the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acted in total disregard for long-established environmental law. ""The use of Nation Wide Permit-12 is not a substitute for following NEPA and the Corps, while having some degree of latitude, failed in its ministerial duty,"" Bishop wrote. ""There was a blatant disregard for established environmental law...which not only included public input, but also directed the agency to consider human health and safety."" To date, the lawsuit has not been heard in court. While the environmental community hones in on Keystone XL's northern half, the business community has focused on expediting permits in the Bakken Shale and filling in the gap left behind by the lack of aTransCanada ""Bakken Marketlink."" Big Business has done so -- in the main -- by using pipelines to ship Bakken crude to key rail hubs. One of the pipelines listed in the Federal Infrastructure Projects Dashboard is the Bakkenlink pipeline -- not to be confused with the ""Bakken Marketlink"" -- a 144-mile-long tube set to carry fracked oil from the Bakken to rail facilities that would then carry the product to strategic markets. ""Currently, crude oil from this region of the Bakken field is transported to rail facilities via truck,"" explains the Dashboard. ""The proposed BakkenLink pipeline provides an opportunity to eliminate a vast amount of overland truck traffic."" Petroleum News Bakken, an industry news publication, explains Bakkenlink was proposed when the northern half of Keystone XL was put on hold by the Obama Administration. ""Originally the BakkenLink was intended to run all the way to Baker, Mont., where it was to connect to the Keystone XL pipeline, but when the Keystone XL project was put on hold in 2011, BakkenLink LLC modified its plan and opted to terminate the pipeline at the Fryburg rail facility,"" Petroleum News Bakken explained. The Bismarck Tribune explained Great Northern Midstream LLC -- which wholly owns BakkenLink LLC as a subsidiary -- has built capacity to load fracked Bakken oil onto 110-car unit trains via the Fryburg rail facility. For sake of comparison, TransCanada's Bakken Marketlink Pipeline -- aka Keystone XL -- was slated to bring 100,000 barrels per day of crude to market. The freight trains scheduled to carry this oil are owned by Burlington Northern Sante Fe (BNSF). BNSF itself is owned by Warren Buffett, the fourth richest man on the planet and major campaign contributor to President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Another key data point: a 70-unit train carrying 51,428 barrels of fracked Bakken Oil to a Canadian east coast export terminal owned by Irving Oil derailed and exploded in a fireball on July 2013, killing 47 peoplein Lac-Mégantic, located in Québec province. Coming full circle, Irving Oil and TransCanada announced a joint venture to develop and construct an export facility in St. John, Canada on August 1, less than a month after the lethal Lac-Mégantic derailment. That facility would take tar sands crude shipped from the 1.1 million barrels per day proposed TransCanada Energy East pipeline and export it to the global market. Bakkenlink isn't the only game in town for the March 2012 executive order's impact on expedited permitting in the Bakken Shale. Enter the Bakken Federal Executives Group --  helped along by Obama's Assistant for Energy and Climate Change Heather Zichal -- the Obama White House's industry-friendly liaison to Big Oil. ""[I]dentified by the President as one of five priority regional initiatives under Executive Order 13604 ... [the] [g]roup represents a dozen federal bureaus with review and permitting responsibilities that are working collaboratively to address common development obstacles associated with the Bakken boom...,"" explains an August 7 U.S. Department of Interior press release. Newly-minted U.S. Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell -- a former petroleum engineer for Mobil Oil Company -- recently took a trip to the Bakken Shale oil fields to advocate for the dictates of the March 2012 Executive Order. ""The group's Aug. 6 itinerary began with a tour of a rig operated by Continental Resources Inc., followed in the afternoon by a tour of facilities operated by Statoil, which has invested more than $4 billion in the Bakken,"" explained the Oil and Gas Journal. Continental Resources' CEO is Harold Hamm, who served as energy advisor to Mitt Romney, the Republican Party presidential nominee for the 2012 election. ""Interior continues to be a leader in implementing President Obama's vision for a federal permitting process that is smarter [and] more efficient,"" David Hayes, Department of Interior Deputy Secretary said in a June press release. ""By coordinating across the many federal agencies involved in the Bakken region ... we are able to offer a better process for industry."" On May 17, 2013, President Obama issued an updated memorandum titled, ""Modernizing Federal Infrastructure Review and Permitting Regulations, Policies, and Procedures."" Citing his March 2012 executive order as precedent, this memo called for cutting the time it takes to approve major infrastructure projects -- pipelines included -- in half. ""By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to advance the goal of cutting aggregate timelines for major infrastructure projects in half,"" he states in the memo, with a final goal to ""institutionalize or expand best practices or process improvements that agencies are already implementing to improve the efficiency of reviews."" Adding insult to injury, a recent story appearing in The Wall Street Journal explains Keystone XL's northern half is no longer a priority for refiners, investors or the industry at large. With a further delay in the cards due to conflicts of interest in the State Department's environmental review process, it may start to matter less and less for Big Oil as it plans out its other options for getting its product to market going forward. ""U.S. companies that refine oil increasingly doubt that the controversial Keystone XL pipeline [northern half] will ever be built, and now they don't particularly care,"" explained the Journal. Enbridge recently proposed an expansion for its Alberta Clipper pipeline (approved by Obama's State Department in August 2009, now known as ""Line 67"") from 450,000 barrels per day to 570,000 barrels per day to theState Department in a November 2012 application. It upped the ante since the original Clipper expansion application -- a move met with activist opposition --requested 800,000 barrels of tar sands run through it per day. That's on top of Enbridge's recently proposed Nationwide Permit 12 -- paralleling what TransCanada did for Keystone XL's southern half -- set to bring 600,000 barrels per day of tar sands to Cushing, Okla from Pontiac, Ill. The reaction to pressure against building Keystone XL's northern half has been -- put simply -- ""build more and faster."" Simple math and geography shows -- as The Wall Street Journal boasted -- project permitting parameters have tilted more and more in Big Oil's favor under President Obama's watch. With full-throttle expansion of the tar sands described as ""game over for the climate"" by now-retired NASA scientist James Hansen -- and with fracked oil and gas found to be dirtier than coal when examined in its entire lifecycle according to a May 2011 Cornell University study -- it makes for scary math indeed.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
How To Improve Your Listening Skills At Work,"Whether you’re new on the job or you’ve been employed at your company for  while, everyone can use a lesson in improving how they listen at work. How many times have you been stuck in a meeting and zone out during a presentation or someone is speaking on a topic you have no interest in and you figure — why bother, so you end up checking your tweets or hop on Tinder and start swiping? But did you ever think you’re the one with the listening problem? Probably not. If you’re not walking out of meetings feeling inspired, productive, or accomplished, you should reevaluate your listening skills. Yes, there are a few meetings you’ll attend in your career that leave you wondering, “Why did this just happen and how do I get back the last 45 minutes of my life,” but if every meeting or gathering you attend leaves you feeling that washed out — something’s a miss and my bet is on your lack if paying attention. But you can fix all that with some self-awareness and practice. (And you can apply this to your relationships at home too)  There are two types of listening we can do, we either “listen for” or “listen with.” I’ll break down the two so you can quickly see the major difference between the two and how its been impacting your career. “Listening for” is the type of listening you do when you’re being receptive to ideas and open to suggestions. Someone is talking and you’re actually listening with the intent of grasping their concept, main idea, or information. The act of “listening for” will leave you with some type of insight and it’s the best type when you’re receiving feedback from a supervisor or a colleague. This type of listening will advance your career and accelerate your plans of climbing the success ladder. “Listening with” is the kind of listening that closes you off to what’s being said and shuts down any chance of truly having an exchange. This type of listening comes with baggage. You’re either listening with judgment, bitterness, or “fill in the blank.” You are too busy trying to get your point across that you’re missing the actual exchange and the opportunity to establish collaboration with another department, colleague, or better your relationship with your supervisor. Now, you may be mentally flipping through situations and thinking, but Penny in Payroll seems to always “listen for” and she gets trampled on and Sheri in Media is always “listening with” and she’s a hard core profit making machine for the company. It may seem like the good guy does’t always finish first, but my focal point is you — not them. What’s best for you and your career and where you want to go? Since listening usually involves two people, and you’re part of the equation, you want to make sure you’re not creating a hostile work environment and leaving behind a trail of negativity because you never know who will be listening when it’s time to switch companies and you’re on an interview for a new job with an old coworker.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Thousands Of Tree Swallows Come To Roost In Front Of Your Eyes (VIDEO),"You don't need to be a birder to appreciate the peacefulness and majesty of this natural phenomenon.  A few lucky boaters were recently on the lower Connecticut River at just the right time. A flock of thousands of tree swallows enveloped the dusk sky overhead, swooping and swarming in unison as the onlookers gasped in awe. They captured this breathtaking footage of the passerines in action just before they landed to roost on nearby Goose Island for the night.  These iridescent blue-feathered birds with white bellies roost on Goose Island every year during the late summer and early fall months. As many as 300,000 birds flock at a time and can settle in under two minutes -- a spectacle that often causes the Connecticut Audubon Society's annual boat tours to sell out. Tree swallows are abundant across their field and wetland breeding grounds in North America and form massive flocks for migrating, molting and roosting. ",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Establishment-Backed Moderate Wins Heated Democratic House Primary In Texas,"Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a corporate attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Texas’ 7th Congressional District on Tuesday, reassuring national Democrats eager to flip the GOP-held seat. Fletcher’s win in a runoff reflects the preference of primary voters for a mainstream Democrat capable of appealing to enough of the affluent, suburban Houston district’s Republican voters. It also delivers a victory for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official body charged with electing the party’s candidates to the House. The DCCC backed away from an active role in the campaign after provoking outrage among some progressives with a February opposition research memo against Fletcher’s more liberal opponent, Laura Moser. Fletcher finished first in a seven-candidate March primary, but the controversy over the DCCC helped propel Moser to a close second-place finish, setting up the runoff race. With Fletcher’s nomination, “Texas Democratic primary voters chose their heads over their hearts,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist who lives in the district. “Rather than opting for the aggressive progressive Laura Moser, they opted for the nearly equally liberal Lizzie Fletcher.” In November’s general election, Fletcher faces Rep. John Culberson, a nine-term Republican. Although Culberson has often easily won re-election, this year Democrats came out of the woodwork to challenge the deeply conservative congressman. Texas’ 7th is one of just three GOP-held districts in the state where voters narrowly opted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in he 2016 presidential vote, making it a prime Democratic pickup opportunity in the midterm elections. The district went for Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent, a sharp swing from 2012 when it went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama by 21 percentage points. The devastating effect of Hurricane Harvey last year has also made Culberson more vulnerable than normal. He promoted the expansion of an interstate highway that some of his constituents believe left their neighborhoods more vulnerable to flooding. For the most part, however, the district’s sizable majority of so-called country-club Republicans remains loyal to the GOP. Any Democrat hoping to unseat Culberson will need to convert at least some voters who traditionally support Republicans down the line, but might appreciate a member of Congress willing to hold Trump more accountable. Fletcher, who supports abortion rights and shoring up the Affordable Care Act, is more moderate than Moser, a proponent of Medicare-for-all and founder of the anti-Trump “Resistance” text-message app, Daily Action. Perhaps more important than policy distinctions, the two candidates differed in their styles. “Without question, Fletcher’s rhetoric and style were much more consensual and less anti-Republican and anti-Trump,” Jones said. While Fletcher had the endorsement of the establishment-linked group EMILY’s List, Moser drew support from less well-heeled progressive grassroots groups like Democracy for America and Our Revolution, the successor group to Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. Fletcher’s win is also a major setback for organized labor, which bitterly opposed her bid. She was anathema to regional labor unions because she is a partner at AZA Law, a firm that represented a Houston janitorial services company in a dispute with the Service Employees International Union, which was seeking to unionize the company’s workers.  AZA successfully won a $5.3 million lawsuit against the state’s SEIU chapter, forcing it to declare bankruptcy. AZA Law also boasts on its website of successfully defending a Houston-based oil equipment supplier against a discrimination lawsuit filed by eight current and former African American employees. Fletcher did not work on either of the cases but as a partner, she profited from them indirectly.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Bill Gates Says Trump Didn't Know The Difference Between HPV And HIV,"Microsoft founder Bill Gates told his foundation’s staff that President Donald Trump didn’t know the difference between HPV and HIV when they met with each other on two different occasions, according to an exclusive clip obtained by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. The clip shows Gates telling the room that in two separate meetings with the president, specifically recalling a March 2017 meeting, Trump asked him about the difference between the two viruses. “He wanted to know if there was a difference between HPV and HIV,” Gates said in the clip. “So I was able to explain that those are rarely confused with each other.”  HPV, the human papillomavirus, is an infection that can cause genital warts and lead to cervical cancer, while HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Gates said Trump also referred to himself in the third person, reportedly telling him that “Trump hears that you don’t like what Trump is doing.”  Exclusive footage obtained by All In... Bill Gates dishes on his meetings with Donald Trump. More tonight at 8PM ET. #inners pic.twitter.com/Zoehj1WTfk The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated millions to public health and development initiatives. In 2016, the foundation announced a $140 million donation to help develop an implantable drug pump to prevent the spread of HIV.  Gates has also spoken out against Trump’s “America First” policy. The tech giant told Politico in March that he planned to explain the importance of foreign aid to the president during their meeting.  “I’ll take his framework and explain why things like health security and continued foreign aid, even in that narrow framework, where you give no credit for saving lives in Africa, kind of pure humanitarian things, even without that, this is money well spent,” Gates told the outlet. Trump reportedly offered Gates a job as a White House science adviser at their meeting this March. Gates told Stat News in April that he rejected the proposal, as it wouldn’t be a good use of his time.  ",POLITICS,TECH

Martina Navratilova: John McEnroe Made Far More For Wimbledon Commentary,"Tennis great Martina Navratilova said her salary for Wimbledon commentary was no match for John McEnroe’s ― and she’s slamming the BBC for the disparity. Navratilova said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that McEnroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament. “It’s hard to really compare exactly because some people work a little longer days, maybe a few more programs or whatever,” Navratilova said in a preview clip of “Britain’s Equal Pay Scandal,” posted by BBC Panorama (watch above). “But overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 pounds for Wimbledon. And unless John McEnroe’s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he’s getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.” Navratilova made about 10 appearances compared with 30 for McEnroe during Wimbledon, BBC Panorama estimated, per the Telegraph. BBC Sport told the Guardian that McEnroe’s participation was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment.” “Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage,” a spokeswoman said. “He is a defining voice within the BBC’s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this – gender isn’t a factor.” McEnroe’s earnings came to light last year when the BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between £150,000 and £199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks. When told that the BBC may use McEnroe’s greater hours as a defense, Navratilova said the disparity still didn’t add up. She said she was told that she and McEnroe were making a comparable wage. “It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,” she said. Reps for McEnroe didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.",SPORTS,SPORTS
"In Senate Hot Seat, Scott Pruitt Dodges Questions Over Mounting Scandals","WASHINGTON — Facing numerous allegations of ethical violations, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on Wednesday dodged tough questions about his travel practices, ties to lobbyists, unprecedented security detail and unapproved raises for top staff. In a hearing on the environment before the Senate appropriations committee, Pruitt acknowledged the numerous scandals plaguing his tenure over the agency but repeatedly deflected blame to his staff or simply said he did not recall the details surrounding them. He did, however, confirm that he has set up a defense fund to help him with legal costs. “There have been decisions that as I look back, I would not make the same decisions again,” Pruitt said. Ethics watchdogs and federal investigators are conducting at least a dozen inquiries into Pruitt’s reliance on first-class air travel, expensive trips abroad, use of emergency lights and sirens to cut traffic in Washington, D.C., round-the-clock security protection, trips to Disneyland and the Rose Bowl, unapproved raises to top staff, the purchase of a soundproof phone booth, and a sweetheart condo deal on Capitol Hill that was arranged by an energy lobbyist, among other things. The seemingly unending stream of negative reports about Pruitt’s behavior drew the ire of some GOP senators and even staff at the White House. “Your tenure at the EPA is a betrayal of the American people,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the committee, told Pruitt in the hearing. “I’m worried you are spending all your time enriching yourself and your friends while betraying your mission to protect human health and the environment.”  Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said after the hearing that he was concerned Pruitt’s legal defense fund would become a “potential snake pit for conflicts of interest.”  In his testimony before the panel, Pruitt said he would not accept contributions to his legal defense fund from lobbyists or businesses who have business before his agency. But he did not say flatly that he would not accept anonymous contributions. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of Pruitt’s most vocal defenders, brushed off concerns about the fund but said he had not and would not be contributing to it.  Van Hollen also criticized Pruitt for what he called an “ongoing pattern,” where evidence surfaces about ethical violations and “he points the finger at other people at the agency, and then we discover he was personally involved.”  Pruitt, the former attorney general of Oklahoma, skirted questions about whether he requested round-the-clock security detail his first day on the job, as The Washington Post reported Monday, or if his security detail used emergency lights and sirens during non-emergencies. Pruitt said that “to the best of my knowledge,” the agency followed the policies in place. “You personally requested that the sirens and the flashing lights occur, is that right?” Udall asked. “No, I don’t recall that,” Pruitt responded. Udall submitted for the record a February email from then-EPA special agent Pasquale “Nino” Perrotta contradicting Pruitt’s claim. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pressed Pruitt over his preference for first-class travel, expressing skepticism that he would be at risk from the American public by flying in coach. “What a silly reason ... Nobody even knows who you are,” Leahy said, drawing some laughter in the committee room. Leahy added that Pruitt’s ego, first-class travel and special phone booth made him and the agency “a laughingstock.” Udall kicked off his first line of questioning by asking Pruitt something unrelated to him and EPA: Does he support special counsel Robert Mueller completing his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election? Instead of answering yes or no, Pruitt said it’s important for investigators to be able to provide prosecutors adequate information that would allow them to make informed decisions about whether to proceed. “As you know, the right answer is ‘yes,’” Udall said. “Whenever there is an investigation ongoing, a president or Rudolph Giuliani or anybody else shouldn’t be interfering in that investigation, putting time limits on it or anything else.” Republicans on the subcommittee, meanwhile, all but ignored the ongoing investigations, focusing their questions on policy changes at the federal agency. “You have taken a common sense approach to the environmental regulatory process,” said Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.). “For that, I am truly grateful and I have been most impressed.”  Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the committee’s chairwoman, said that instead of being asked about Pruitt’s efforts to return EPA to its core mission, she’s constantly fielding questions about issues like his management and travel. “Some of this undoubtedly is a result of the ‘gotcha age’ that we live in,” she said. Murkowski allowed Pruitt to respond broadly to all the ethics and spending allegations at the beginning of the hearing. Pruitt obliged by touting his record dismantling federal environmental regulations. The EPA administrator further argued that America can both power the world and better protect the environment. “We are making the tough decisions with respect to environmental protection, while at the same time restoring confidence in the American people that we can engage in regulations and not pick winners and losers, and not engage in coercion with our actions,” Pruitt said.

Girl Power: How Remote Work Can Help Shrink Tech's Gender Gap,"The stats on remote working are hard to ignore. From increasing productivity to using less “sick time”, remote working has changed the game in relation to productivity and employee happiness — but it doesn’t stop there. Along with enjoying all the usual perks of working from home, women are seeing what is potentially an even bigger benefit: the ability to raise a family while establishing a career in tandem. According to the the U.S. Department of Labor Blog, there are 74.6 million women working in the U.S. civilian labor force, making up nearly 47% of the working field. The World Bank confirms that many other countries aren’t far behind (some even surpassing these stats!) with female employees making up at least 40% of the overall work force. France, Germany, Australia, The Bahamas, Brazil, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, and dozens of other countries are included in this mix. However, just because women are largely contributing to the overall work force, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still noticeable gender gaps occurring in various fields, particularly that of tech. Catalyst reports that the top female-dominated U.S. occupations are as follows: secretaries, childcare workers, receptionists, teacher assistants, registered nurses, accounting clerks, maids, home health aides, personal care aides, and office clerks. Didn’t see web developers, data scientists, software developers, technical engineers, designers, mobile developers, or system administrators in that list? That’s because these fields are dominated by men — or at least have been… we’re crossing our fingers for a more diverse future. As for the women who are making it in the tech world? Well, simply put, they just aren’t able to stay. The National Center for Women & Information Technology recently reported that 56% of women in the tech industry leave their jobs mid-career. A correlating stat from Pew Research Center states that 51% of women said being a working mother made it difficult for them to advance in their careers. To add to all that, another study conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee found that close to 33% of women left the tech industry because companies were not allowing enough flexibility for a healthy work-life balance. Starting to see the correlation? So what can be made of these numbers? We’ll give you a hint. It starts with “mother” and ends with “hood”. All three of these statistics have clear correlations to women raising families. As the typical “heart of the house”, as well as the ones able to create, grow, and eventually give birth to children, women in the work force have a lot on their plates, both inside of the office and out. That being said, let’s take a look at what truly is stopping women from being able to juggle being both a mother and a career woman. The answer is a simple one: flexibility, or lack there of. When women are subjected to traditional and archaic work systems of remaining in the office from nine to five (or, if we’re being realistic, more likely nine to six, seven, or even eight), there’s simply no way for them to nurture their family life — and that becomes a big problem when it comes to assessing the gender gap in technology jobs. If you haven’t guessed by now, remote working benefits women who are wanting to begin families by providing them with the physical flexibility and time self-management options that they need. Women shouldn’t have to choose between having a career in the tech industry or having a baby, and remote work makes it so they don’t have to. Companies can also hugely benefit off of allowing women to work remotely, both in their workpool diversity and their overall employee retention rates. Going back to the stats, a 2017 study by the UK job board Jobsite reported that 76% of female tech professionals stated that companies offering remote work would be more likely to retain top talent. The issue of the gender gap in the tech world is a frustrating one, but it’s not one that’s impossible to solve. Far from it, in fact. More and more companies are embracing remote employees with every passing day, and if the tech market wants to continue to recruit and keep some of the world’s most talented female workers, they’re going to have to get on board.

Poor Cybersecurity Choices Spawned Today's Current Events,"As former FBI Director James Comey prepares to testify before Congress this week, it is worth reflecting about how poor cybersecurity choices gave rise to today’s current events and our nation’s current crisis. Forget—if you can—who you voted for, the Russians’ role in the election, the FBI’s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and President Trump’s firing of Director Comey. There are three important cybersecurity lessons we can take away from the election and today’s current events. We’ve heard about the laptop computer of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin. The FBI seized the laptop from Mr. Weiner in connection with their investigation into his sexting episodes and also found emails pertaining to Huma Abedin and Secretary Clinton in it. This led to the FBI’s pre-election notifications to Congress, and subsequent speculation about the impact of this on the election. The facts and timing behind this continue to be scrutinized and evaluated. According to some reports, Ms. Abedin merely borrowed her husband’s laptop temporarily before returning it, yet somehow over a half-million of her emails came to reside on it. The lesson to focus on is that we are far too casual about control of our data. Sensitive data should be securely deleted from a computer before we give up control of it—assuming we are under no legal or ethical obligation to preserve that data. We should know where our data is, and where our backups are. If you need to borrow a laptop (even a spouse’s) to check your email or perform certain tasks, be aware of what you are doing, and what you are downloading. Avoid connecting your smartphone to a borrowed laptop, and if you do, don’t let the smartphone back itself up to the laptop, which could leave a copy of all its data on the laptop. If you check your email using a borrowed computer, do it through a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) in “incognito” or “private” mode and ensure your browsing history and data is not stored or is deleted. Don’t access your email through an email client software (such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail) because that might download all of your emails from the cloud onto the loaner laptop. Before your return the laptop, ensure the laptop can no longer access your cloud accounts, and that it has not copied or downloaded your data. There have been recriminations about Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email account and server while she was Secretary of State, but there hasn’t been enough examination of why Shadow IT is a bad thing. When an employee uses personal IT resources to do their job, that activity and data is out of view of the employer, in the so-called “shadows.” An employer provides computer resources to employees and has a responsibility to maintain the systems, keep track of company data, back it up, secure it, and secure the network and devices. When employees use their personal computers and email accounts for work, it creates security risks. The employer can’t secure systems or data it doesn’t know about, and individuals might have worse cybersecurity practices than the employer. It also means that the employer can’t preserve or provide this data when legally obligated to, such as during lawsuits or when responding to public records requests. Secretary Clinton’s use of personal email created a steady drumbeat of negative news. After the election, there were reports that Vice President Mike Pence used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business while Governor of Indiana. Politics and current events aside, the broader lesson for all of us is that Shadow IT presents security, compliance, and document retention concerns for any organization. Shadow IT probably cannot be eradicated, so it is essential that employees have good cybersecurity habits both at work and home. Finally, the hack of John Podesta’s email account revealed emails that spanned a decade and were publicly posted to WikiLeaks before the election. Some emails were damaging to the Clintons and undoubtedly had a negative effect, and reports indicate this hack was conducted or supported by Russia, intended to disrupt or affect the election result. Even if one finds these reports inconclusive, the fact of the hack is clear. Then, it was reported that Vice President Pence’s personal email account had been hacked in the past as well, the personal AOL email account that had reportedly been used for official business. We must all realize that email hacking is going on continuously and we are all vulnerable. Email hackers might launch inelegant frauds, as they attempted from Vice President Pence’s AOL account, essentially blasting to all of his contacts, “Help, I’m stranded in the Philippines, please wire me money.” Hackers also launch highly sophisticated frauds that collectively steal billions of dollars annually, through what the FBI calls “Business Email Compromise” scams, which affect individuals and businesses of all sizes. Hackers can also use confidential information within an email account for financial or other advantage. We all must do a better job protecting ourselves and securing our data. A good place to start is with strong and unique passwords plus two-step login, also known as “two-factor authentication.” We should realize that cybercrime goes beyond technical attacks and includes “social engineering” cons, so we should be wary about clicking on links, downloading attachments, or providing information online. Finally, we should educate our children about cyber safety and ensure that they develop good habits for privacy, safety and proper use of the Internet. None of this should imply that these three choices “caused” the crisis we seem to face today, except in the very limited rubric of what lawyers call “but for” causation. In other words, “but for” the occurrence of these three events, we would not be in the exact circumstance we are now. However, this is merely one small part of the causation test, as the other aspect is legal “proximate” causation. Today’s crisis is a result of a confluence of events and people, far beyond these three cybersecurity choices and resulting events. Nevertheless, the premise holds—cybersecurity choices matter and each of us would do well to make better choices.",TECH,TECH
"Trump Tells 57,000 Honduran Immigrants To Leave Or Risk Deportation","WASHINGTON ― An estimated 57,000 Hondurans who have lived in the U.S. for years must either leave or face deportation, the Trump administration announced on Friday in its latest move to strip immigrants of temporary legal protections. The decision ― made against the urging of Honduran officials, Democratic members of Congress and human rights groups ― comes as the Trump administration is stepping up efforts to deter other Hondurans from coming to the U.S. to seek asylum. Those affected by the decision have been protected from deportation by what’s known as temporary protected status, which allows immigrants to stay in the U.S. after their countries are hit by an environmental disaster, epidemic, ongoing armed conflict or other extraordinary conditions. This is the latest of in a string of moves by the Department of Homeland Security to terminate TPS protections for groups of immigrants. The Trump administration has now announced it will terminate temporary protected status for more than 310,000 people, according to Congressional Research Service estimates ― 98 percent of the total number of people who had the status under the previous administration. In January, the administration said it would end TPS for about 200,000 immigrants from El Salvador. It did the same in November for about 46,000 Haitians. Thousands of people from Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan were also told to leave or find legal status since Trump became president. DHS typically terminates TPS for a country with an effective date in the future so people can get their affairs in order. Honduran TPS holders will have until January 2020 before their protections expire.  DHS officials have argued in each instance that TPS is meant to be temporary ― it’s part of the name ― and has been extended too often in the past. Administration officials have argued TPS decisions must be based solely on whether the country conditions have improved with regard to the situations that led to the protections in the first place ― in the case of Honduras and El Salvador, devastation caused by a hurricane in 1998. DHS said in a statement that conditions “that resulted from the hurricane have notably improved” and the disruption caused by the hurricane had “decreased to a degree that it should no longer be regarded as substantial.” But both countries face ongoing problems, as do some of the others whose nationals are losing their protections. Advocates for extending TPS argue the administration could and should consider them. Honduras’ murder rate fell in 2017, according to its government, but is still among the worst in the world for peacetime nations. Last November, Honduran security forces shot and killed at least 16 people participating in a protest over the election, according to the United Nations. Another protest over the election turned violent on May 1.  “Honduras was on fire and the election crisis threw gasoline on it,” Joaquin Mejía, a Honduran security expert and human rights lawyer, told HuffPost last month. “It unmasked the reality of the country ― our institutions are broken and the president, because of the elections, has no legitimacy.” Thousands of people have fled violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala to come to the U.S. in recent years, leading to border apprehensions of Central Americans exceeding those of Mexicans for the first time in 2014.  Many of the Central Americans apprehended at the border, including families and children, are seeking asylum or other relief in the U.S. The Trump administration is seeking powers from Congress to restrict access to asylum. In response to a caravan of several hundred asylum-seekers coming to the U.S., Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen publicly urged them to stay in Mexico, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to criminally prosecute those he could. Many Hondurans with TPS have deep roots in the U.S. They have about 53,500 U.S.-born children in total, and 6 percent of them are married to a legal U.S. resident, the think tank Center for Migration Studies estimated in a 2017 report. Nearly a quarter of them have mortgages, according to the same report.  Omar Banegas, a 29-year-old Honduran TPS recipient, came to the U.S. as a 1-year-old in 1990 because he needed surgery on his eyes due to a premature birth. His family overstayed their visas to continue his treatment, and later received TPS. Now fully blind, he fears returning to Honduras, where his father was shot about 8 years ago. “There’s really no words,” he told HuffPost after hearing the news that TPS would be terminated. “It’s really tough.” Honduran officials had urged the U.S. government not to end TPS. With an eye on the upcoming TPS decision, it had enhanced efforts to crack down on cartels and human trafficking and sided with the Trump administration at the United Nations last year over moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, USA Today reported. The Trump administration hinted for months that TPS for Hondurans would end. In November, then-acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke said the administration needed more time to make a decision on the matter, and extended the program for a six-month period ― rather than the more common 12- or 18-month extensions. White House chief of staff John Kelly, who preceded her at the helm of DHS, pressured her to end the protections, The Washington Post reported at the time. Duke denied those reports. Nielsen, a former top Kelly aide, took over as DHS secretary in December and terminated TPS for Salvadorans the following month. She told the House homeland security committee on April 26 that “some countries remain perhaps unstable and have difficult conditions, but if they are not a result of the originating designation, that designation must be terminated.”  Only four countries are still designated for TPS without a termination date: Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. They make up only a small portion of the total TPS recipient population ― about 7,000 people. The Trump administration extended TPS for South Sudan and Syria, but must decide in coming months whether to do the same for Yemen and Somalia.",POLITICS,POLITICS
FedEx Says It Will Continue Offering NRA Members Discounts,"FedEx will not end its partnership with the National Rifle Association, the company said Monday, even as other companies are heeding calls from activists and severing their ties with the organization.  The shipping company said in a statement that it sees assault-style rifles and large-capacity magazines as an “inherent potential danger.” But it added that it would not end or change its relationship with the NRA.  “The NRA is one of hundreds of organizations in our alliances/association Marketing program whose members receive discounted rates for FedEx shipping,” the company said. “FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.” NRA members are eligible for discounts of between 18 percent and 26 percent on certain FedEx shipping services.  FedEx responds to questions on the National Rifle Association, gun safety and policy https://t.co/qYgmbyQ5jk pic.twitter.com/02q1hD2Q9s Teenagers have become a leading voice in challenging the NRA in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month. Students across the country have organized walkouts, protested in front of the White House, challenged lawmakers and started social media movements such as #BoycottNRA. David Hogg, a Parkland survivor advocating for gun reform after the shooting, has specifically been calling on FedEx and other companies to cut ties with the NRA. “No matter who you are or what organization are I’d be a huge help if you changed your shipping service over to @USPS or @DHLUS or @UPS in support of us. In fact tweet out at companies that use only use @FedEx and demand action! Let’s get this done!” Hogg tweeted Monday before FedEx issued its statement.   A number of companies, including Delta, United Airlines and Enterprise Holdings, have ended discount programs for NRA members in the last few days. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Climate Change Threats To 'The Least Of These' Compel Evangelical Christians To Act,"""Climate change is a really bad reason to get divorced.""  Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist, recalled the trial she and her husband Andrew, an evangelical Christian pastor, faced when they discovered they weren't on the same page about global warming. After a number of intense discussions, mediated by shared values and beliefs, their marriage persevered. Andrew accepted the overwhelming scientific evidence, and they even went on to co-write a book for Christians on climate change. But in evangelical churches across the U.S., a faith community to which Hayhoe herself belongs, many pastors and parishioners continue to perceive an incompatibility between their faith and the climate science.  This kind of dissonance is unnecessary, according to Hayhoe, and an unhealthy roadblock to much-needed action. ""The [climate change] issue is not inconsistent with Christian values,"" Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, told The Huffington Post. ""In fact, Christian values demand we take action. Climate change disproportionately affects the poor and vulnerable -- the very people Christians are called to care for and love.""  That the poor bear the brunt of global warming's effects, from food insecurity to waterborne diseases, is one of the key takeaways from the United Nation's latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released this week. The same theme emerges in a new Showtime series, ""Years of Living Dangerously,"" set to premiere April 13. Co-produced by James Cameron and starring celebrities including Harrison Ford and Matt Damon, the documentary addresses the entanglement of politics, faith and science that impedes acceptance and action on climate change.  Hayhoe is a prominent figure in the first episode. Evangelicals, who currently represent about a quarter of the U.S. population and wield significant political clout, aren't necessarily worried about the Earth itself, noted Rev. Mitchell Hescox, president of the Evangelical Environmental Network, a ministry dedicated to caring for the natural world.  But a growing number, himself among them, ""realize the overwhelming impacts of climate change on human life, both here and around the world,"" said Hescox, who worked for 14 years in the coal industry and 18 years as an evangelical pastor before taking the helm of the EEN. ""It affects all the social concerns of the church -- poverty, immigration, and the list goes on,"" he said. ""What the IPCC report really helped to highlight is that this is a people problem, not an Earth problem.""  The environmental movement among evangelical Christians -- also known as ""creation care"" -- isn't new. Dedicated leaders such as Rev. Richard Cizik have been working to engage fellow evangelicals for more than a decade. And despite resistance from colleagues, they've made progress. In a study published last year, researchers found that about half of evangelicals now believe climate change is happening and that we should adopt policies to reduce it. The majority of evangelicals surveyed, however, did not think human activity is to blame. ""Within the community, there are still some stark differences of opinion,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and an author of the study. ""A lot of that falls on political grounds.""  Leiserowitz called the relationship between evangelicals and right-wing politicians ""symbiotic."" ""If all of a sudden, Mitch McConnell, Speaker [John] Boehner, Rush Limbaugh and 'Papa' [Bill] O'Reilly all started to say, 'You know what? We've been wrong all these years about climate change,' then that would dramatically change the conversation,"" he said. ""At the same time, most of those folks are going to respond to what their constituents and key influencers are telling them."" ""No doubt, evangelicals are still a powerful force within the Republican Party,"" added Leiserowitz.  Rev. Hescox, too, underscored the need to uncouple science from politics in order to move forward on the issue. Other evangelicals echoed the call. ""A thermometer is not Republican. A thermometer is not a Democrat,"" Andrew Farley, an associate professor of applied linguistics at Texas Tech, tells Don Cheadle, a celebrity correspondent, during the first episode of ""Years of Living Dangerously."" (The show will also be available online April 7.) Farley, of course, is Hayhoe's husband -- her first climate change convert. She sits next to him during the conversation with Cheadle in their Lubbock, Texas, home. Later in the show, Hayhoe travels to Plainview, Texas, one town over, where she gives a talk to residents on climate change's role in the devastating drought of 2013. About 10 percent of the area's workforce lost their jobs when the heat and lack of rain drove the Cargill meat plant to shut down. The popular view in the small town was that the drought was God's will, or part of a natural cycle. Cheadle interviews a cattle rancher in town before Hayhoe's visit. ""There's only one man who knows how much rain we're gonna get,"" the rancher said. ""That's God, and he's not a scientist."" One of the roadblocks to climate change becoming a nonpartisan issue, and to opening up more ears to the science, according to Hayhoe, is the evangelical community's lack of strong hierarchical leadership. There are influential people like Cizik, but unlike with other faith traditions, there is no pope, archbishop or other central figure that everyone can look to.  ""We have this leadership vacuum that I think has been filled with conservatives who aren't necessarily Christian. People get their opinions from AM talk radio, or from Fox News,"" Hayhoe told HuffPost. ""This is also a generational issue. If you talk to the average 20- or 30-year-old, you might get a very different perspective,"" she added. Anna Jane Joyner and her father, Rick Joyner, an evangelical megachurch preacher, exemplify that age gap.  ""Growing up, the focus of the conversation was always on sin and salvation and the afterlife,"" recalled Anna Jane, 29, of her upbringing. ""There wasn't a big emphasis on our experience in this life and this world, other than what you shouldn't do."" During college, much to Rick's initial chagrin, Anna Jane became an environmental activist. The fourth episode of ""Years of Living Dangerously"" profiles Anna Jane's attempt to convince her father that climate change is real. He had already followed his daughter's lead on some environmental issues, such as pollution. While Anna Jane said she couldn't yet disclose to HuffPost where her father landed on climate change at the end of the show, she offered one hint: ""I underestimated the power of ideology when we're talking about this issue, for sure."" This week, more than 20 Christian colleges across the country hosted climate change events in response to the IPCC report, including a nationwide ""Day of Prayer and Action"" on Thursday. Ben Lowe, national spokesman for the event's organizer, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, suggested there are many reasons he and his peers are embracing the issue.  ""I consider myself pro-life,"" he said. ""I see this as an issue affecting lives and health of people all around world."" Recent work by Leiserowitz and his colleagues identified two key messages from the Bible that appear to compel evangelists to take up the issue. In the Old Testament, God calls on people to be stewards of his creation. In the New Testament, Jesus commands people to care for ""the least of these"" -- the poor, the sick, the elderly, the powerless.  ""Many of these churches invest millions of dollars, and their young people often go abroad, to try to help people who are in dire straits of poverty, disease,"" said Leiserowitz. ""So they say, 'How could we in good conscience ignore a problem that is going to push millions more people into those exact same circumstances?'"" Hescox and Lowe noted that their organizations led a trip to Malawi last May for evangelical leaders and youth to witness firsthand the effects of climate change on the poor. As people across America have seen and experienced in recent years, climate-related problems are escalating in the U.S., too. Hayhoe is an author of the U.S. National Climate Assessment, due out at the end of April, which will document the impact on Americans' health and livelihoods of climate events like intense storms, extreme heat and more frequent wildfires. ""When I look at the information we get from the planet, I look at it as God's creation speaking to us,"" Hayhoe told residents of Plainview during her visit. ""And in this case, there's no question that God's creation is telling us that it's running a fever."" The message resonated with people in the audience. ""You know, when you have somebody who believes the same way as you,"" one man told Cheadle, ""when you see that conservative side telling you the message -- it sure makes a lot of difference.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
New York's Harvey Weinstein Probe Set To Continue Despite Attorney General's Exit,"The top law enforcement official in New York resigned Monday night, just hours after The New Yorker published a stunning report in which four women accused him of violent physical abuse, revealing a damning discrepancy between Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s private behavior and his public support of women amid the Me Too and Time’s Up movements. A chief example was Schneiderman’s pursuit of legal action against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in recent months.  Schneiderman’s resignation, effective Tuesday, does not appear to directly affect his office’s efforts to investigate sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, state officials and advocates suggested. In February, Schneiderman’s office filed a civil rights lawsuit against Weinstein’s former company. He had also ordered that any deal to purchase The Weinstein Co. should include a compensation fund for sexual harassment victims and release employees from the nondisclosure agreements that kept them from speaking out about Weinstein’s behavior. In response to pressure from the Time’s Up movement, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in March called on Schneiderman to lead an independent investigation into why Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, failed to prosecute Weinstein in 2015 when police gathered evidence of the producer harassing and assaulting model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood, the state’s solicitor general, who will fill Schneiderman’s post until the state legislature decides on a replacement, affirmed in a statement Tuesday that “our work continues without interruption.” Representatives of the Time’s Up movement said on Twitter that “we fully expect the investigation to proceed as expeditiously as possible,” citing reports last week that Schneiderman had planned to appoint a special deputy to oversee the probe.  The Office of the New York Attorney General has promised to appoint an independent special assistant to investigate recent sexual assault investigations conducted by the Manhattan DA's office & NYPD's SVU. We fully expect the investigation to proceed as expeditiously as possible. The New York attorney general’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on any updates on the special deputy.  During a news conference on Tuesday, Cuomo also suggested the work would continue, saying that the office of Schneiderman’s successor “could be a very important vehicle right now on this sexual harassment chronic issue.” The governor acknowledged that appointing Schneiderman to look into how Vance handled the Weinstein case was “a potential complication,” but he did not elaborate further. In another twist, Vance’s office late Monday announced an investigation into Schneiderman’s alleged domestic abuse. Sonia Ossorio, the president of the National Organization for Women’s New York City chapter, said it was “a conflict of interest” for Vance and called for a special prosecutor. Manhattan DA Cy Vance, who is under investigation by NY AG office for not prosecuting Weinstein abuse, can’t investigate Schneiderman abuse. It’s a conflict of interest. A special prosecutor is needed. Cuomo suggested to a reporter that Vance should consider recusing himself. He proposed that district attorneys in other counties where some of the domestic abuse incidents occurred could investigate the claims and potentially recommend criminal action — stressing that the prosecutors should have “not even the whiff or perception of any conflict” and would be “wholly impartial.” By Tuesday night, the governor appointed a special prosecutor to look into the claims involving Schneiderman. The continuing investigation demonstrates that the movement is “bigger than any one person” and “an important reminder that no one is beyond reproach by virtue of what they say in public,” Emily Martin, the general counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, told HuffPost, saying that she was not concerned that Schneiderman’s abuse allegations would mar the credibility of the investigation.  “It’s not about Eric Schneiderman,” Martin said. “It is about a much larger movement to ensure accountability, and that is beyond the power of Eric Schneiderman to impugn.” “I would hope that the new acting attorney general really recommits and redoubles the office’s efforts to address these allegations against Weinstein and others,” she said. “Part of making clear that gender-based violence is unacceptable is by demonstrating that Eric Schneiderman’s resignation in no way weakens the state of New York and the office of the attorney general’s commitment to pursuing justice in these matters.” This story has been updated to reflect that Cuomo appointed a special prosecutor to investigate Schneiderman on Tuesday night.",POLITICS,POLITICS
2013: A Year to Remember,"Although 2013 had its share of tragedies (Typhoon Haiyan), portents (reaching the 400 ppm mark for atmospheric CO2) and absurdities (the shutdown of the federal government), it also was in many ways a landmark year for the Sierra Club and the issues we work on. So in this last post of the year, I want to highlight some of the very good things that happened: In February, the largest climate march and rally in American history filled the National Mall. More than 50,000 people braved one of the coldest days of the year to let President Obama know that we expect him to lead on climate -- starting with a rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Not so long ago, the conventional wisdom was that the pipeline was a foregone conclusion. Thousands of grassroots activists have both turned that around and raised national awareness of the dangers of extreme fuels like tar sands. Earlier that week at the White House, I joined with Sierra Club Board members Allison Chin and Jim Dougherty and several dozen other grassroots environmental leaders in the Sierra Club's first-ever civil disobedience. In March, President Obama designated five new national monuments, including Rio Grande del Norte in New Mexico and the San Juan Islands in Washington State. Less than a month later, the Senate confirmed his nominee for Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell -- a dedicated outdoor enthusiast who understands the economic, recreational and conservation benefits of protecting public lands. Here's hoping that 2014 sees even more ambitious monument designations and protections for public lands. In June, President Obama delivered a groundbreaking speech that laid out his Climate Plan: ""As a president, as a father, and as an American, I'm here to say we need to act."" The Obama administration has already followed through on elements of the plan, including ending financing of overseas coal plants, but has much to do in 2014 to meet the obligation and clean energy opportunities identified by the president, particularly by curbing carbon pollution from power plants and by rejecting projects that would expand dirty fuel production, such as the Keystone XL pipeline, drilling in the Arctic and new LNG export terminals. About those carbon standards: They mean that 2013 is the year that coal-fired power, which was already in decline, lost all hope of a comeback. The EPA not only released draft carbon-pollution standards for new power plants but also held listening sessions on standards for existing power plants -- which were filled with passionate proponents of clean energy. In October, the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign celebrated its 150th coal plant retirement. Eight more retirements have been announced since then. Strong carbon-pollution standards will only accelerate the move away from dirty coal.   Progress in fighting dirty fuels is great, but it's even better when accompanied by a surge in clean energy. Because Congress waited too long to renew the Production Tax Credit, the wind industry got off to a slow start this year, but it's sure booming now, as evidenced by the $1 billion order for turbines placed just this week by Warren Buffett's MidAmerican Energy. Wind is increasingly competitive with both coal and natural gas and, in places like Iowa, is already the least expensive source of new power. In 2014, expect to see more utilities choosing to invest in renewables for mainly economic reasons, as Xcel Power in Colorado did this year. By the way, falling costs also helped made this a record-breaking year for solar power, with enough new solar electric capacity added to power more than 850,000 average American homes. The Sierra Club's own Solar Home Program has now helped more than 1,000 homes go solar. There's no way to know exactly what challenges next year will bring, but one thing I am confident about is that we're going to build on all the progress we made this year in replacing dirty fuels with clean energy sources. Here's to a happy renewable year in 2014.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Here's What Happens When A Catholic Hospital Won't Try To Save You,"The Trump administration is poised to hand religious conservatives another victory: a slew of new federal rules that would give religious health care providers wide latitude to refuse to treat patients or perform procedures if doing so would violate their religious beliefs. Some of the most powerful hospital networks in the country have lobbied for these “conscience” rules, claiming they shouldn’t fear a legal risk for practicing medicine according to their religious beliefs. But those same hospital networks are already using religious justifications to place women in life-threatening situations with impunity, documents obtained by HuffPost show. At a hospital owned by Ascension, the largest Catholic hospital network in the country and a staunch proponent of a rule that would give nearly any health care worker the right to refuse care, doctors refused to intervene as a woman was undergoing a life-threatening miscarriage because they believed that doing so would be the same as performing an abortion, the documents show. Instead, they carted her out to the hospital parking lot so a relative could drive her to a different emergency room, where she underwent a massive blood transfusion and emergency surgery.  Ascension, which operates more than 150 hospitals according to these same religious principles, also runs a hospital where doctors refused to perform a tubal ligation, even though the patient was at risk of dying if she ever became pregnant again. And at hospitals controlled by Trinity Health, a network that manages nearly 100 care centers around the Midwest, multiple women have accused doctors of withholding emergency medicine because it violated their prohibitions on certain kinds of reproductive health care. One of the new rules, which the Trump administration proposed in January but has not finalized, would limit patients’ and advocates’ ability to protest these incidents. The rules would broaden and define the legal right of virtually any health care worker, from surgeons to nursing home attendants to receptionists, to refuse to provide or facilitate medical services that go against their personal religious beliefs or their employer’s. The reach of the new guidelines would be widespread. The American health care system relies heavily on Catholic and other religiously affiliated hospitals. Around 1 out of every 6 hospital beds in the U.S. is located in a Catholic facility, according to a 2016 report. That means for many Americans, the closest hospital is one that might refuse to treat them. That’s what happened on Oct. 25, 2012, when a woman arrived at St. John Hospital and Medical Center of Detroit in an ambulance. The woman was between 17 and 23 weeks pregnant — a point where an infant would not survive outside the womb — and in the midst of a miscarriage. Her condition was life-threatening and indicated that she needed an emergency termination to prevent the risk of bleeding to death, according to a complaint later filed by a medical staffer at another hospital. Doctors at St. John recognized they would not be able to prevent the death of the woman’s fetus. But they refused to offer her emergency intervention.  “I’m not sure why you’re here,” a doctor at St. John told the woman, according to the complaint. “We can’t help you since you’re having an abortion.” For a hospital, failing to try to stabilize a patient in a medical emergency is a violation of federal law. St. John broke this rule, then violated regulations again when it failed to transfer the woman to another hospital, federal investigators determined. When the woman left St. John, her heart rate was elevated and she was bleeding so much that staff were constantly cleaning blood off her body, according to documents from the investigation. But instead of calling an ambulance, St. John staff gave her directions to another hospital, placed her in a wheelchair and wheeled her into the parking lot. An unidentified woman then drove her away. “I think it was her mom or her aunt,” one staff member told an investigator. “I just saw her get into a car with a woman. Do you know if she got care at [the other hospital] and if she is OK?” In fact, once the woman arrived at Hutzel Women’s Hospital, she had a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery to stop a “massive hemorrhage,” according to notes from the investigation. The woman had to be hospitalized for three days.  Several weeks later, a staff member at Hutzel filed a complaint about the woman’s treatment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for “multiple episodes of poor care.” “It seems inconceivable that a major hospital with labor and delivery services lacks the ability to care for a pregnant patient who is having a miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage,” wrote the staff member, who is unidentified in the documents. “I believe that further investigation into these events is warranted to determine... why she received improper management of her life-threatening condition. She is interested in understanding also.” In an interview with a federal investigator, a St. John staff member said, “We are a Catholic institution and we do not perform abortions here if there are fetal heart tones.” All of Ascension’s hospitals adhere to a set of ethical guidelines written by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that bans abortion services or “material cooperation” in an abortion. The guidelines do allow doctors to perform certain procedures as long as the primary goal is not to terminate the pregnancy but to save the life of the mother. But in practice, many Catholic hospitals place a blanket ban on any procedure they consider an abortion. Ascension is not the only Catholic health care system pressing the Trump administration to protect it from consequences for risking patients’ lives. Trinity Health, which has lobbied the Trump administration to dismantle an Affordable Care Act rule prohibiting gender discrimination, owns and operates several hospitals that have been accused of violating federal laws requiring hospitals to provide patients with basic care. One woman accused a Trinity hospital of refusing to remove her intrauterine device, which had been dislodged when she fell down, causing her weeks of pain. Mercy Health Partners in Michigan, which Trinity owns, risked the lives of five women who were having dangerous miscarriages by failing to offer a kind of medical intervention the hospital considered to be abortion, a whistleblower told federal authorities. All of the women suffered potentially fatal infections for which the typical treatment is to hasten the miscarriage. The whistleblower later reported three more cases where medical records suggested the hospital withheld certain treatment options because of its Catholic affiliation, according to federal records obtained by HuffPost.  A spokesperson for Mercy Health Partners declined to comment. Ascension did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Religiously affiliated hospitals already rarely face consequences for refusing to provide treatments. Under former President Barack Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services made a brief and perfunctory threat to suspend St. John’s right to participate in Medicare, but dropped it once St. John took “corrective action.” Trinity Health did not receive any major citations for breaking any laws after federal investigators received the complaints about Mercy. And courts have dismissed a string of lawsuits against Catholic hospitals for refusing reproductive health care.  With the new rules in place, they could enjoy even more protection.",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Loose-Lipped Rudy Giuliani Does Not Represent U.S. On Foreign Policy, Warns State Department","Despite Rudy Giuliani’s recent dramatic pronouncements about international affairs, Donald Trump’s new attorney does not represent the U.S. when it comes to policy or speak for the president on world issues, the State Department emphasized Monday. “He speaks for himself and not on behalf of the administration on foreign policy,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told The Associated Press. Giuliani boasted on “Fox & Friends” last Thursday that “we” have North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “impressed enough to be releasing three prisoners today.” As of Monday evening, there had been no announcement by the White House concerning any such release, nor had the prisoners been freed.  Giuliani backtracked Saturday, telling reporters he had no idea what the prisoners’ status was, adding, “I’m reading the newspapers like you are.” He said, “The less said about it right now, the better.” He also said on Saturday that he and Trump were “committed to regime change” in Iran, Politico reported. It’s “the only way to peace in the Middle East” and “more important than an Israeli-Palestinian deal,” Giuliani told reporters after a speech in Washington hosted by the Organization of Iranian-American Communities. Trump is considering withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear pact but has not publicly called for the overthrow of the Iranian government. Rudy Giuliani advocates regime change in Iran: ""I think it's the only way to peace in the Middle East. It's more important than an Israeli-Palestinian deal"" https://t.co/9CvDlr7Wut https://t.co/C0fm0ufEXe Giuliani has been straying so far into State Department territory that a reporter asked White House press secretary Sarah Sanders last week if he had been tasked with a wider role to “talk about things like foreign policy, as he did.” She replied, “Not that I’m aware of.” Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., a member of the House Armed Services Committee, called Giuliani a “loose cannon rolling around the Oval Office with another loose cannon, namely the president.” Giuliani “really needs to stay out of the North Korea issue. It’s very sensitive,” Garamendi said on MSNBC on Sunday. “Who knows what might happen from some comment from Giuliani?”",POLITICS,POLITICS
Walmart To Raise Age Requirement To Buy Firearms And Ammunition,"Walmart has vowed to raise its age requirement to 21 years old for customers looking to purchase firearms or ammunition from their stores. The retail giant decided to change its firearms policy “in light of recent events,” Walmart said in a statement to reporters on Wednesday. In addition to the age requirement, Walmart will be removing from its website any items that resemble “assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys.” “We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms and go beyond Federal law by requiring customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm,” the company’s statement read. NEWS: Walmart will be increasing the firearms and ammunition purchasing age to 21 ""in light of recent events."" pic.twitter.com/hYLW5aeZkR Walmart’s announcement comes two weeks after a gunman with an assault-style rifle opened fire at a high school in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring more than a dozen. The horrific attack prompted another round of debates on common-sense gun laws in America. The survivors of the Valentine’s Day school shooting spent the last two weeks pressuring lawmakers and the National Rifle Association to take action against gun violence. To get their attention, the survivors, mostly students, maintained a steady presence in front of news cameras, organized nationwide school walkouts and staged protests in front of state capitols and the White House. Before Walmart’s announcement, President Donald Trump met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the White House to discuss gun laws and school safety. Though Trump spoke vaguely about his support of a number of different policies, the president urged lawmakers from both parties to write a “strong bill” that is “really strong on background checks.” He also accused Republican lawmakers of being intimidated by the National Rifle Association after Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) told him that a bill he co-wrote to strengthen background checks did not raise the age requirement for gun purchases from 18 to 21. Trump told Toomey, “Because you’re afraid of the NRA, right?” The president’s remarks were also directly at odds with some of the NRA’s positions: Trump said he wanted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that modifies guns to simulate automatic fire, and he insisted that police should be able to confiscate guns from people who may appear to be dangerous.

"Farm Bill Would Cut Food Stamps, Is Friendly To Farmers","WASHINGTON ― Every five years, Congress passes a farm bill that pairs farm subsidies and food stamps, relying for passage on a coalition of rural and urban lawmakers.  But this year, that coalition is threatened by the bill’s uneven treatment of farmers and poor people. While it would limit food stamp eligibility with expanded work requirements and a lower income ceiling, it would make receiving subsidies easier for some farmers. Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and the bill’s lead author, pointed out that farm incomes have been sharply down since reaching record highs in 2013.  “We’ve always had a safety net for farmers, and we’re trying to maintain it,” he said. “We don’t put any new money in the program.”  The federal government spends roughly $17 billion annually on farm subsidies, including crop insurance and programs that protect against drops in farm revenue and commodity prices. Currently, high-earning farmers are ineligible for the commodity programs. Conaway’s bill would adjust the way commodity subsidies are calculated and exempt some types of businesses from an income limit.  At the same time, some food stamp recipients would be subject to a stricter income limit, with the maximum household income for eligibility reduced from the current 200 percent of the poverty line to 130 percent for certain applicants. The measure would cut off 400,000 households. The lower income threshold for some Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, plus new work requirements and other provisions, would shave the number of beneficiaries by 1.2 million over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Under current law, the office projects that enrollment will fall from about 40 million to 32 million a decade from now.   Hey. Do you currently or have you recently received food stamps? Tell me about it ― email arthur@huffpost.com. Please include your phone number if you’re willing to be interviewed.  Since Democrats are unanimously opposed, Conaway has been trying to woo conservative Republicans in order to pass the bill on a party line vote, with the food stamp reductions as his main selling point.  Conservative groups outside Congress have been mildly supportive of the SNAP changes but strongly against the overall bill because of its farm subsidy provisions. “There are some changes to the nutrition programs, and there are no positive changes to the [agricultural] welfare programs,” said Joshua Sewell, a policy analyst with the conservative organization Taxpayers for Common Sense. Currently, farmers with incomes above $900,000 are ineligible for commodity subsidies, which are capped at $125,000 annually per farm household member. The bill would remove the income limit for certain businesses classified as pass-through entities ― so called because their profits pass through to their owners’ individual tax returns instead of being taxed at the corporate level.  “All we did is try to level the playing field between entities,” Conaway said, arguing that federal regulations make arbitrary distinctions between different type of firms. “Individuals still have the same exact qualifying standards.” In other words, each owner of a high-earning farm could receive a full subsidy individually as long as his or her annual income is less than $900,000, or $1.8 million for a married couple. The bill would allow farmers’ cousins, nieces and nephews to receive subsidy payments, rather than just immediate family members, as under current law.  “They’ve put Ancestry.com in charge of our farm subsidy system in a way that’s going to expose the taxpayer to untold new costs,” said Scott Faber of the  Environmental Working Group, a liberal nonprofit.  Farm partnerships in which partners are individually eligible for subsidies make up about 6 percent of farms and receive 17 percent of farm payments, according to an EWG analysis. Under the proposed legislation, partners in some pass-through entities currently treated as a single unit — additional 5 percent of farms — would be eligible for subsidies individually.  Both liberal and conservative farm welfare critics say U.S. agricultural subsidies unnecessarily benefit the biggest farms and create an unhealthy incentive for consolidation. Farm households with annual incomes above $250,000 accounted for 12 percent of farms but 60 percent of subsidies in 2012, according to the most recent data. Farms with more than $1 million in sales were responsible for 51 percent of production in 2015, up from 31 percent in 1991.  Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of die-hard conservatives from whom Conaway needs support to get his bill through the House. Jordan said that he has been focused on the food stamp provisions and that he figured there would be amendments addressing the farm subsidies.  Conaway is hoping to bring the farm bill to the House floor for a vote as soon as next week. He has been pushing party leaders to disallow amendments from anyone who doesn’t plan to vote for the final version of the bill — a highly unusual stipulation.  “That type of loyalty pledge would make even President Trump blush,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “This is deeply undemocratic and suggests Democrats shouldn’t even bother to participate in the amendment process.” Whatever passes the House would ultimately have to be merged with a Senate bill that will likely have far more modest provisions, since Democrats hold enough Senate seats to block the legislation.

This App Sends Alerts When Donald Trump Tweets About Stocks You Own,"As much as it pains us to say this, Donald Trump’s tweets have global impact. And when the president-elect tweets about public companies ― companies you may well have stock in ― a finance app called Trigger wants to tell you about it.  Trigger lets users set up, well, “triggers” that alert them when a stock reaches a low or high or moves a certain percentage. The latest Trigger offering is aptly called a “Trump trigger.”  As Trigger told Yahoo, the notification “gives you the ability to trade stocks based off of Trump’s tweets about public companies.” It’ll immediately tell you when Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock you own. Trump has tweeted about all sorts of companies ― from Amazon to General Motors to Macy’s. After he tweeted a threat to cancel the order for Boeing’s Air Force One jet because of the cost, the company’s stock fell almost 2 percent. (Boeing later said its contract with the Air Force was only $170 million.)  Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.

This Jared Kushner-Backed Bill Could Be 2018's Last Shot At Federal Prison Reform,"WASHINGTON ― A revamped bipartisan prison reform bill introduced this week with the backing of president’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner outlines steps to improve the lives of some federal prisoners. But it has drawn opposition from many advocates for change who want a more comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system. The FIRST STEP Act, introduced by Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), is expected to be marked up in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. The legislation focuses on lowering recidivism of federal prisoners and would require the federal Bureau of Prisons to create evidence-based rehabilitation plans for all inmates. If passed the legislation would allow some federal prisoners to earn more credit towards reduced sentences for “good time” and would require federal prisoners to be placed within 500 miles of their homes. It would also ban the use of restraints on pregnant prisoners and encourage compassionate releases for elderly and terminally ill offenders. Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director and co-founder of #Cut50, a criminal justice reform organization, told HuffPost that Kushner has been “a driving force behind the scenes” in support of the legislation. “We understand that the president is willing to sign it. I hear Jeff Sessions is not very happy with it, but there’s so much agreement on it at this point that he is not getting in the way,” Jackson Sloan said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the legislation. Jackson Sloan said Kushner had a tremendous degree of empathy for federal prisoners and their families. “His insight as a person who was negatively impacted by the criminal justice system has been very valuable,” she said, referencing the 14 months that Kushner’s father spend in federal prison. “I’m a strong Democrat, and I had no relationship with him prior to this, so it’s been very interesting to see his passion for this issue, and I think that comes from a personal place, having been through that and seeing what his own father went through, and really the impact on him,” she added. Some Democrats and civil rights organizations are skeptical of legislation that doesn’t have a broader impact. Todd A. Cox of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund wrote that a narrow proposal would “undermine bipartisan efforts to develop a comprehensive reform package that most Americans support.” Last month, a large number of civil rights organizations came out against legislation that only addressed prison reform and said that the bill could have a disparate racial impact because it made large numbers of prisoners incarcerated for certain offenses ineligible for earning time credits. Alex Gudich, the deputy director of #Cut50, said that his group sees the bill as a good start when it’s “harder than it’s ever been” to achieve something across the aisle. He added that this didn’t have to be the last word on criminal justice reform. “People who say that if Congress does this now they won’t return to this for years or decades to come, I just don’t buy that because I just don’t think everybody is getting everything that they want here,” Gudich said. “The Democrats are not getting sentencing reform, but Republicans are not getting mens rea. They’re not getting civil asset forfeiture. They’re not getting things that touch on the criminal justice system that are listed as their priorities.” The DOJ has so far declined to weigh in on the legislation, but Sessions ― an opponent of broader federal sentencing reform ― has come across as a skeptic of re-entry programs. Speaking last week at a National Sheriffs’ Association conference, he said that the Justice Department’s inspector general had not been “complimentary” about the how the federal government had handled re-entry in the past. Sessions also begrudgingly noted the decrease in the federal prison population in recent years and the decrease in the length of the average sentence. He also suggested there was a correlation between the lower federal prison population and increased crime. While he sounded generally skeptical about re-entry programs, he did indicate that he thinks “re-entry programs can help reduce recidivism.” Kushner and Sessions had reportedly reached a compromise that allowed Kushner to push for prison reform without interference from Sessions. With the backing of the White House, Kushner wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal last month that said President Donald Trump’s “fight for the forgotten men and women of this country... includes those in prison.” Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

The Sky's the Limit for Amazon," The US Patent Office just awarded Amazon a patent for flying warehouses. In addition to giving it vast amounts of mobile storage space, the E-commerce leader plans to use these warehouses as launchpads for its drone delivery force. It has already branded these flying blimp-like storage facilities as Airborne Fulfillment Centers, or AFCs.  How will they operate? Shuttles (smaller air ships) will be used to transport workers to and from the AFCs, replenish them with inventory, and provide them with necessary fuel, and supplies.  The AFCs will hover at high altitudes - roughly 45,000 feet. Drones will be deployed to deliver ordered items to customers. As they descend to their destinations, the drones are expected to use little or no power. They laughed when I predicted packages will be delivered by drones

When I first wrote a post in August of 2013 suggesting that companies will deliver products via drones, a number of readers ""laughed at me"" in their disparaging replies. Here is just one of the more polite ones...  ""What makes you think these drones won't have cameras, and audio recorders and sniffers? What leads you to think that these tracking devices will be accurate, tamper-proof, incorruptible and honest? Will they deliver to my fourth floor walkup? My fortieth floor elevator lobby? Stinky gas driven, or nuclear? Shoot-able? How about net-able? The unemployed, more everyday after this, will grab these and sell the parts. Especially the nuclear fuel. Yeah. Can't wait."" Vindication from Jeff Bezos and Charlie Rose Not long after my post, during a 60 Minutes broadcast, Jeff Bezos showed Charlie Rose a room full of ""Octocopters"" branded as Amazon Prime Air that will deliver products to customers. Bezos, Amazon, Charlie Rose and 60 Minutes have the corporate image credentials to give this idea credibility, and once the FAA issues are resolved, you will see this happen. At the time of the broadcast, Bezos said he is an optimist and predicted it will happen in 4 or 5 years. Others said it would take 15 years. Further vindication from Walmart In 2015, Walmart announced it has asked the FAA for permission to test drones for delivery in its parking lots and at customer homes. It also wants to use drones to check inventories and the condition of its vast network of facilities. Since there is a Walmart store within 5 miles of 70% of the US population, drones potentially provide an efficient way to move product through its extensive supply chain. Amazon makes its first drone delivery On December 14th of this year (2016) - just 3 years after the optimistic prediction of 4 to 5 years, Amazon already made its first successful drone delivery to a customer in the UK. I hope that the naysayers are paying attention. Potential for being a very efficient distribution channel As many already know, the Internet has become perhaps the most convenient channel for distributing products. Buyers can search for what they want, find products that fit their needs, compare prices, read reviews on the products and sellers, and order products 24/7 without leaving the comfort of their home or place of business. Main drawback  The problem is that for products that are not in digital form, buyers have to wait for packages to be physically sent via common carriers or through the mail. Too often, shopping carts are abandoned once charges are shown. Currently, this is the bottleneck in the process. To overcome this bottleneck, those that want the product right away typically travel to a local store with the hope of finding it in stock. Of course, buyers still have to make their way to the store as they worry about time, traffic, parking, and other inconveniences. And, in some cases, they are disappointed to learn that the store does not have what they want. Technologies to solve the distribution problems In addition to Amazon's AFCs and drones, there are some interesting technologies available (and on the horizon) that might provide a solution to the problems related to physically distributing products. In particular, drones and 3-D printers hold a lot of promise in the not so distant future. 3-D printers A technology that is here today and being rapidly advanced for delivery of products is 3-D printing. Users will be able to order products via the Internet, Smart TVs, and smart mobile devices. A 3-D printer at the ordering location (for those that have one) or at a 3-D printing center (operating similar to a FedEx copy center) will then make the products according to a blueprint, recipe, or software program. Where will the ingredients that are fed into the printer come from? There are many possibilities. They might be (1) already purchased in a traditional way and stored in the home, office, hospital or place of business, (2) loaded into purchased cartridges similar to ink cartridges in an inkjet printer, (3) delivered by drones, or (4) sent through a system of underground tubes similar to the way water, gas, and other utilities are delivered today. Taking this one step further, once products are used, a similar (but separate) tube system can be used to sterilize, recycle, and process any waste. If you think this sounds crazy, just wait... While this may sound far-fetched, the system of utilities, modes of transportation, and technologies that are commonplace today would be hard to imagine not so long ago. Perhaps the biggest hurdles are not technological. They are more likely political, legal, regulatory, and economic. Municipalities need the vision to invest resources in these delivery and recycling systems. If properly designed and executed, these systems will ultimately pay for themselves in convenience, efficiency, security, and time. Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek A bit further out on the technology advancement timeline is the concept of delivering physical products by quantum teleportation represented by the famous Star Trek phrase ""Beam me up, Scotty."" If and when this technology is ever available, which many futurists believe it will be, products ordered from a company at point A can be delivered quickly to point B. New forms of distribution and delivery are coming No matter what technologies are employed, there are (and will continue to be) new ways to deliver physical products from seller to buyer. This holds tremendous promise for almost every field of endeavor from the distribution of good-tasting food to the delivery of life-saving medical devices and procedures. Thinking about this future is exciting. Making it a reality is even more exciting.  With the recent patent announcement, Amazon is showing us, once again, that they are thinking about the future and working on potential solutions that can make storage, delivery, and fulfillment what we all want it to be. Look up, and stay tuned.",BUSINESS,TECH
"GoPro Omni, New Virtual Reality Camera, Unveiled","As tech giants like Samsung, Huawei and Facebook continue to ramp up their virtual reality efforts, GoPro is entering the fray as a new contender for the hearts of VR enthusiasts and fans.

A Grim Pattern: Presidential Voting And Workplace Deaths,"By Paul Feldman, FairWarning More than 4,800 American workers are killed on the job each year. But in states that were carried by Donald Trump, the chances of dying at work are higher than in states that Hillary Clinton won. With a single exception, the states that voted Republican had at least three job-related deaths per 100,000 workers, according to the most recent federal labor statistics for 2015. In all but two states that went Democratic, the workplace death rate was less than three. Two states that Trump won by landslide margins, North Dakota and Wyoming, had the highest fatality rates of 12.5 and 12.0 per 100,000 workers, respectively–more than four times the death rates of most states that went for Clinton. A key factor, experts say, is that red states tend to have a higher percentage of hazardous blue-collar jobs, while the more urbanized blue states have more white-collar and service jobs. “The big cities where Hillary got most of her votes are not where the foundries, the mills, the logging, the mines are,” said Adam Finkel, a former OSHA official now at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. And with the Trump Administration and Republican Congress pledging sweeping cuts to federal regulations, which they say will spur economic growth, some analysts warn that workers in states that voted for Trump could be in greater peril. “Workers and citizens in states in which a majority voted for Trump have much to lose if the Trump Administration weakens enforcement or reduces support for health, safety and employment standards,” said Professor Thomas A. Kochan, co-director of MIT’s Institute for Work and Employment Research. “Trump states have, on average, weaker state level laws and enforcement agencies than do states that have stronger Democratic histories.” Since the relatively small number of workplace deaths can give rise to random variations, particularly in low population states, analysts caution against giving too much weight to the statistics. Nevertheless, the most recent data follow a pattern of death rates being higher in the South and Appalachia and lower in New England and the West Coast, said John Mendeloff, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. “Where workers are lower paid, not as skilled, easier to replace, that probably gives lesser incentives for safety to employers,” Mendeloff said. “In other words, the costs of accidents are lower.” The pattern is strikingly similar to the link between state voting preferences in the November election and traffic death rates. As FairWarning reported earlier this month, the states that favored Trump consistently had higher traffic fatality rates than the states that backed Clinton. Since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was created in 1970 during the tenure of President Nixon, workplace deaths have shrunk nationwide from 38 a day to 13, agency data shows. During that period, which also saw the enactment of such measures as the Mine Safety and Health Act, the death rate for miners has dropped by more than 75 percent, according to research by the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low wage workers. Although Trump’s controversial first nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, withdrew and his replacement R. Alexander Acosta has yet to be confirmed, efforts to scale back workplace protections are already underway. The Senate is expected to vote in coming days to strike down an Obama-era rule requiring businesses seeking federal contracts to disclose previous labor violations –anything from wage-and-hour abuses to workplace hazards. The move would come under the Congressional Review Act, which Republican lawmakers are using to target a number of environmental and health rules enacted during the Obama administration. Also vulnerable is an OSHA regulation requiring companies to submit workplace injury rates for posting on the Internet. Interest groups including the national Chamber of Commerce and the National Chicken Council last month filed suit in federal court in Oklahoma to have the measure overturned. OSHA has yet to reply to the lawsuit, and it’s uncertain how, or if, the agency will defend the rule. But in a sign of the times, among the first people dispatched by the Trump administration to the Labor Dept. was longtime business lobbyist Geoffrey Burr, who as a vice president of Associated Builders and Contractors fought both the requirement for federal contractors to disclose labor violations and the electronic filing of injury rates. Business groups contend that federal regulations are weighing down the economy. According to Eric J. Conn, a Washington D.C. attorney who specializes in defending OSHA cases, government rules “when taken collectively, can stifle job growth.” Cutbacks in labor protections would reverse the approach of the Obama administration, which stepped up enforcement and upgraded safety standards for exposure to silica, beryllium and other hazards. “If they start cutting back on enforcement and do fewer inspections, I think that will likely lead to more workplace deaths,” said David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor in charge of OSHA during the Obama administration. “Many employers don’t need OSHA to motivate them to protect their workers, but others clearly do.” “Where are the trenches and where are the derricks?” Finkel asked. “The hazards are in the red counties and so that’s where the death toll will rise if all of a sudden there was no enforcement or if there was a rollback of existing regulations.” For whatever reason, workplace death rate statistics for 2015 almost precisely mirrored 2016 presidential voting results. The only red state with a death rate lower than 3.0 was Arizona (2.4). The lowest death rates were in dependably blue states ranging from the very largest to the very smallest –California at 2.2, Washington and Massachusetts at 2.1, Delaware at 1.9 and Rhode Island at 1.2.

Twitter Wins Dismissal Of Lawsuit Alleging Islamic State Support: Federal Judge,"Twitter Inc won a bid to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the widow of an American killed in Jordan which accused the social media company of giving voice to Islamic State, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick in San Francisco ruled that Twitter cannot be held liable for Islamic State’s rhetoric, but gave the plaintiff a chance to refile an amended lawsuit. Social media companies including Twitter have faced pressure to crack down on online propaganda linked to terrorism. Tamara Fields, a Florida woman whose husband Lloyd died in an attack on the police training center in Amman last year, said Twitter knowingly let the militant Islamist group use its network to spread propaganda, raise money and attract recruits. While Orrick called the deaths “horrific,” he agreed with Twitter and said federal law protects the company from liability for the content that third parties publish on its platform. Attorneys for Fields and a Twitter representative could not immediately be reached for comment. In her complaint filed earlier this year, Fields said San Francisco-based Twitter had until recently given Islamic State, also known as ISIS, an “unfettered” ability to maintain official Twitter accounts. “Without Twitter, the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most-feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible,” the lawsuit said. Twitter had previously said the lawsuit was without merit, but that “violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and, like other social networks, our rules make that clear.” (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Alan Crosby and David Gregorio)",TECH,TECH
Przewalski's Horse Foal Born By Artificial Insemination,"From Mother Nature Network's Russell McLendon: A newborn horse in Virginia has scientists celebrating, and not just because she's cute. The still-unnamed filly isn't a regular domesticated horse — she's a Przewalski's horse, a formerly extinct species deemed the last true wild horse on Earth. She's also the first of her kind born via artificial insemination, a milestone seven years in the making. Przewalski's horses (pronounced ""sheh-val-skee"") were declared extinct in the wild 44 years ago, wiped out from their native China and Mongolia by hunting, habitat loss and livestock encroachment. Fourteen survived in zoos, and thanks to conservationists, they had enough offspring to begin reintroduction in the 1990s. Those horses then reproduced in the wild, and in 2008 the species was upgraded from extinct to endangered. There are now about 500 wild Przewalski's horses on Earth, all carrying the genes of those original 14 founders. Another 1,500 or so live at zoos and breeding centers, but boosting their numbers while maximizing genetic diversity can still be a challenge. ""It seems reasonable to assume that reproduction for the Przewalski's horse would be similar to domestic horses, but it simply isn't the case,"" says Budhan Pukazhenthi, a reproductive physiologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia, where the foal was born on July 27. ""After all these years of persevering, I can honestly say I was elated to receive the call informing me that the foal had been born."" The value of artificial insemination is that it doesn't require both parents to be together for a successful mating, thus enabling better gene matches regardless of location. Moving the animals themselves can be expensive and dangerous, the SCBI explains in a press release, while the collection of semen is cheaper, safer and ""significantly improves the efficiency of managing small populations of endangered species."" The foal's mother, Anne, was born at SCBI to a mare from Europe and a stateside stallion renowned for his genes. Her father also lives at SCBI, so the use of artificial insemination was more about demonstrating its viability than geographic necessity. It required specialized animal-handling facilities, hormonal treatments to induce ovulation, and conditioning of Anne to provide urine samples for hormone monitoring and other tests. Anne's pregnancy was confirmed 35 days after insemination using ultrasound technology, and she was monitored closely by SCBI staff for more than 11 months. ""Anne is a young, first-time mother,"" says Dolores Reed, supervisory biologist at SCBI, in a statement. ""She had a normal pregnancy that lasted 340 days, and the foaling lasted less than 10 minutes. I've raised a lot of foals and other hoofed stock over the years, but this filly feels like an extra-special triumph for us and her species."" Przewalski's horses have never been tamed for riding, leading some to consider them the ""last truly wild horse in existence today."" Scientists at SCBI — along with collaborators from Auburn University in Alabama, the Wilds in Ohio and Conservation Centers for Species Survival — say the unprecedented birth of a Przewalski's foal by artificial insemination bodes well not just for her species, but for rare horses everywhere. ""This is a major accomplishment,"" Pukazhenthi says, ""and we hope our success will stimulate more interest in studying and conserving endangered equids around the world.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
"Rooftop Gardens On Buses Makes Total Sense, And Here's Why","From TakePart's Salvatore Cardoni: If you ever wanted to roll up a fistful of ethical practices into a single unit of living, breathing, carbon-neutral mass transit, try this one on for size: A landscape artist in Spain has put a garden on the roof of a bus. ""My mission is to expand the garden area in urban environments, increase the absorption of CO2 and give public transport a new ecological and tourist attraction,"" says designer Marc Granen of his concept, which he's confusingly calling Phyto Kinetic. (When in doubt, keep it obvious, dude: Snakes on a Plane, mustard on a hot dog, Garden on a Bus—see a pattern?)  Reports The Sunday Times: The “autocultural” single-decker has small shrubs and herbs sprouting from its roof. It can be watered naturally or better still, this being the blazing hot city of Girona, near Barcelona, by water from the vehicle’s air conditioning system. If I was the head of public transit in a perennially-rainy city, say Seattle, I'd have ordered a fleet of these garden buses yesterday. Granen's bus-garden baby isn't green for show—he and his team of science advisors have thought this concept through. One concern they've addressed is will the added weight of the garden reduce gas mileage? No—Urban Garden reports that Granen ""utilizes a lightweight, 7-centimeter thick hydroponic foam which is much lighter than soil, thereby significantly reducing the overall weight of the roof."" Ever the eager beaver, Granen admits a desire to one day bring his lush roofs to the buses of the Big Apple. Assuming that the average bus roof size is 20 square meters, he estimates that there are more than 100,000 square meters of green roof in New York City. Imagine what all that photosynthesis would do to Manhattan air? But the landscaper isn't naive. He knows that a similar concept, Bio Bus, has failed to catch on. Still, he's cautiously optimistic about his prototype's future. ""Mistakes offer opportunities for solutions,"" he says. ""Edison performed a thousand failed experiments before developing the light bulb."" Here, here. (Photo courtesy of Phytokinetic.)",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
FBI Arrests Volkswagen Executive In Emissions Scandal: Report,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested a Volkswagen AG executive on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, the New York Times reported on Monday. Oliver Schmidt, who headed the company’s regulatory compliance office in the U.S. from 2014 to March 2015, was arrested on Saturday by federal investigators in Florida, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software known as “defeat devices” in 475,000 U.S. 2.0-liter diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner in testing. In reality, the vehicles emitted up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution levels. Volkswagen declined to comment on the reported arrest. “Volkswagen continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice as we work to resolve remaining matters in the United States. It would not be appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters,” it said. The FBI was not immediately available for comment. Schmidt is expected to be brought before court in Detroit on Monday, the NYT said. Senior VW officials are not attending this year’s Detroit auto show, which is taking place this week. The news comes as Volkswagen was nearing a deal to resolve criminal and civil allegations over its diesel cheating, crucial steps toward moving past the scandal, which has cost it billions of dollars and its reputation. Volkswagen shares were up 2 percent at 141.75 euros by 3.16 a.m. ET, at the top of a 0.2 percent-weaker German blue-chip DAX .GDAXI, on the expected deal.

Experts Are Building A 'Pokemon Go' Robot For Everyone To Play With,"It may seem like everyone is playing “Pokemon Go,” but some people can’t even if they want to. Poke-fans with physical disabilities say the smartphone game, which requires a lot of movement in the real world, simply isn’t accessible, writer Cecilia D’Anastasio explained earlier this month in a must-read piece on Kotaku.  But a new robot may give those people an interesting way to experience the game. Let’s Robot, a four-person startup in Berkeley, California, is hammering away at a prototype that’s capable of playing the game with input from human players. The group published a video to YouTube Monday showing a very rough proof of concept. “The video I posted was like the first time we actually got the hardware hooked up and programmed,” Jillian Ogle, an independent video game developer who heads the group, told The Huffington Post in a phone interview Tuesday.  The robot in the video doesn’t look like much. It has six wheels, and it uses a simple “plotter” to interact with a smartphone’s touchscreen.  “At that stage, we hadn’t even programmed any preset moves or anything, and the motors are moving super-slow because it’s in a safe mode,” Ogle explained. “They can go quite a bit faster, but we’re going to have to come up with an even faster solution for flicking.” Capturing monsters in the game requires you to “flick” your finger across the screen to throw a “Poke Ball.” The robot isn’t up to the task in this video, but Ogle said it’ll get there. The overall goal ― as with many of Let’s Robot’s projects ― is to present an interactive livestream on Twitch. People will be able to tune in, watch the robot wheel around and issue commands to determine how it plays the game. “People who don’t have access to go around and play ‘Pokemon Go’ can at least have some experience with this robot and be able to participate with everyone else,” Ogle said. It won’t be a replacement for the full experience. Group-play efforts like “Twitch Plays Pokemon,” an event where humans banded together to play the original Game Boy game, tend to be a bit chaotic, with thousands of people issuing commands at once.  Still, if you want a fresh look at the world’s biggest game, you could certainly do worse. Just ask these guys.",TECH,TECH
What's The Future Of Bitcoin Mining?,"Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 5 years, you’ve likely at least heard the word “Bitcoin” before. While you’ve almost certainly heard about it, there is a fair chance you don’t fully understand what it is, how it works, and why people are so excited about it. Bitcoin was started in 2008 by an unknown person or group who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. While bitcoin has received lots of coverage focused on its potential as a currency, industry insiders are quick to point out that it’s really much more than that. Bitcoin as a currency is simply one application that uses Blockchain technology, the underlying technological framework that makes the currency, and all other potential applications possible.  While explaining all the complexities of bitcoin would take many posts, the key thing to know is Bitcoin is essentially a decentralized network of computers. You have an address for Bitcoin to be sent to, and a secure wallet to store them. While Visa and Mastercard have their own data centers to power their network, confirming transactions, payments, etc. Bitcoin is decentralized and is powered by what’s known as Bitcoin miners. These Bitcoin miners provide computing power to the Bitcoin network which solves the complex math problems required to power the network in exchange for a fee, paid out, of course, in Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is the backbone of the Bitcoin industry which has already raised well over $1 billion in venture capital from the world’s leading venture capitalists. But, the industry is changing quickly. Just a few years ago mining could be done from home, now it’s large multi-million dollar organizations running the show building out massive “farms” dedicated to one thing: mining bitcoin. Q: How do you see Bitcoin mining changing in the future?  Marco Streng: In just the past 2-3 years, we’ve seen a massive jump in technology, even outpacing Moore’s law. This has already changed within the last year and mining has moved more and more from a short term quick profit game to a slower, patient and more steady industry where only the most efficient operations have a chance to yield high profit within an extended frame. This trend will clearly continue as we are approaching Moore’s law and the development of newer technology gets more and more expensive. Q: Are you concerned about the internal conflicts taking place in the industry? (Blocksize limit, etc.)  Marco Streng: I have to admit there was a time especially beginning of this year where miners and core developers opinions sometimes were fundamentally different which caused the ongoing scaling debate. Although this was quite a lengthy and intense discussion within the community I am glad that there is consensus now about the immediate next goals and there are good reasons to be positive and excited about what’s to come. In fact the variety of solutions for on chain scalability such as for example the upcoming SegWit or Schnorr Signatures as well as solutions for off chain scalability such as for example Lightning or Thunder Network make me more bullish on bitcoin than ever before not even mentioning Sidechains and Rootstock. It’s really great seeing these solutions being worked out!  Q: What other cryptocurrencies are the most interesting from a miner’s perspective?  Marco Streng: There are a lot of different cryptocurrencies in the currently booming altcoin market that are really quite interesting for miners. The top candidates in my opinion are Ethereum, Dash, storage coins such as Sia or Maidsafe and the upcoming Zcash. There are a lot more than those and the list is by far not complete, but those are certainly one of the most interesting ones at the moment. We can be very excited to see what the altcoin market which often is seen as the innovative playground for cryptocurrencies brings up. Anonymous oriented coins or file storage based coins as the ones mentioned are not the only ones and there is certainly a lot more to come. Q: What’s the future of Bitcoin in general?  Marco Streng: When you look at the Gartner Hype ycle and consider 2014, we were clearly at the “Peak of Inflated Expectations” point, then we dropped directly into “Trough of Disillusionment” and now the industry as a whole is fighting it’s way towards productivity. There has been lots of venture capital invested into some really amazing Bitcoin focused startups lead by incredible entrepreneurs. This capital is currently being deployed and an entire infrastructure is being built, which of course, takes a long time. Where the industry goes from here largely depends on these entrepreneurs and companies to make sure they leverage this amazing technology to solve real problems that real people and companies need solved.

Elon Musk: SpaceX Launch Explosion Is 'Most Difficult' Failure In 14 Years,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 9 - SpaceX founder and chief Elon Musk said on Friday he was unsure why one of the company’s Falcon rockets burst into flames on its Florida launch pad last week, destroying both the rocket and an Israeli communications satellite it was due to lift into orbit. “Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years,” Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who is also the chief executive of Telsa Motors, wrote on Twitter. Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years. A SpaceX-led accident investigation is underway, overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration’s Commercial Space Transportation office. A massive fireball enveloped the rocket on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine test of its first stage. The rocket was scheduled to blast off two days later. The rocket’s nine engines had not yet ignited for a test firing when a fireball engulfed the upper stage. “There was no apparent heat source,” Musk said on Friday. The accident destroyed the $200 million communications satellite owned by Israel-based Space Communication, which was going to be used by Facebook and Eutelsat to expand internet access in Africa. Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX has not yet said how much damage was done to its launch pad, located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX has backlog of more than 70 launches for commercial and government customers, worth more than $10 billion. The rocket that was destroyed was the second of 29 Falcon 9 rockets to fail. It took SpaceX about three weeks to identify the likely cause of its previous accident, which occurred on June 28, 2015. The problem was traced to a faulty bracket, which was holding a bottle of helium inside the rocket’s upper stage. When the strut broke about two minutes after liftoff, the upper-stage liquid oxygen tank over-pressurized and ruptured, triggering an explosion. SpaceX replaced thousands of struts throughout its fleet and had successfully flown nine times before last week’s failure. “We remain fully confident in the results of (that) investigation ... The current investigation has no bearing on this,” SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton wrote in an email to Reuters. SpaceX’s next flight had been slated for later this month from a second launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. “We have confidence that SpaceX will resolve the matter and when they do we will be ready to launch,” SpaceX’s customer, Iridium Communications Inc, told Reuters on Friday. SpaceX said last week it was looking to shift its Florida launches to a nearly completed pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, adjacent to its Cape Canaveral site.

Partial Eclipse Of The Heart,"One of my daughters made  the trip to North Carolina to see the eclipse in the “totality”  zone. I’m a little jealous- but mostly just happy that she had the  chance to do it. My wife and I, and those of our kids at home for the moment, saw only  a partial eclipse here in Connecticut. Despite that, and the pesky  clouds, it was pretty spectacular. All the more so for knowing this is  really just the trivial consequence of the smallest of cosmic gears,  turning in our inconsequential solar yard- yet still enough to rivet the  attention of an entire nation of people, if not this little world. After viewing the eclipse and capturing a few images like the one  above, I gave in immediately, and sadly, to the sudden insistence of “I  told you so” impulses. I sent out social media commentary noting how  reliably “science” had predicted the eclipse down to the second and  degrees of latitude, and how comfortable everyone was in counting on  those predictions. Eclipse glasses were sold out everywhere. But just the same prowess of just the same science  is refuted, rejected, and repudiated any time inconvenience or Internet  conspiracy theories come calling- on matters of climate, diet,  immunization, and more. I wanted to watch the partial eclipse in the sky and think only about  this celestial reprieve from the tussles down here, the grandeur of  nature. Instead, I was thinking about what hypocrites we are, and how  our hypocrisy might very well wind up destroying the one little bit of  nature’s grandeur we get to call our own, this heretofore magnificent  planet. The froward turn of heart partly eclipsed the once-a-century spectacle in the sky, and I regret that. But I regret even more the willful ignorance that allows us to  embrace science for the pleasures of just such spectacle, and pejorate  it when our very survival is at stake. I regret that the gratifying  truth of astronomical prediction did not just douse the sun with moon  shadow, but also cast a harsh light on post-truth, alternative-fact narratives. I  regret the obstinacy, shortsightedness, egocentrism, profiteering, and  opportunism that may cost future generations the treasures of nature,  and the natural endowments of scientific insight. Watching the dance of star and moon from this earthly theater we may  allow ourselves to ruin- I felt that more than the sun was overcast by  shadow. There was much more to see in this sky than the moon between us and our sun. There were also all the ways this celestial reality check  might provoke us to see and follow new paths between now, and any  version of the future our children deserve- assuming, that is, there’s  intelligent life down here. -fin David L.

It's On: Oil Versus Electric,"Something suspicious is going on in the media coverage of car fires this year. Three Tesla Model S cars caught on fire this year, all due to high-speed impacts. Not a single person was hurt. By comparison, the U.S.A. has had more than 250,000 gasoline car fires in the past year and a half. Those gasoline car fires resulted in over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries. (extrapolating 2012 NFPA data) Which fires did the media decide to focus on? Which fires generated more headlines than all the others combined? The three Tesla fires that resulted in a grand total of zero deaths and zero serious injuries, of course. Seems a bit strange, doesn't it? I think so, too. Perhaps I am paying more attention, because I am one of the 19,000 people on Earth that are driving a Tesla Model S, a car that has received the highest safety rating possible. It is the safest car in America, or anywhere else in the world: There have been zero deaths or serious injuries in a Tesla Model S worldwide due to a fire, or any other accident.  But, based on the number of headlines, three fires with no injuries provoked, I can't help but feel like there are other powers at work here.   Let's step back and look at the big picture. Up until now, there has been no serious threat to the world domination of the oil industry and the internal combustion engine. It's a system we have been forced to use because of the simple fact that there has been, until now, no other choice. Enter a brilliant young entrepreneur - who also happens to be a rocket scientist - who creates a compelling and sexy electric car that goes on to win every award under the sun.  There is so much excitement around the Tesla Model S that it is not uncommon for me to come out of the grocery store in North Carolina and find people in the parking lot taking photos of my car. Earlier this year, Tesla made headlines when the Model S became the first car in history to win Motor Trend Car of the Year by unanimous vote. Then Consumer Reports called it the best car they ever tested and gave it a score of 99/100. In May, Tesla wired nearly $500 million to the government and became the only American car company to fully pay back their government loan. Oh, and by the way, they did it nine years early, with interest - $25 million in interest, in fact, back to the taxpayers. Ouch, I bet that goes down like a jagged little pill in the boardrooms of certain other car manufacturers. Tesla is rocking the boat. What started as a ripple has now become a wave and the boat they are rocking is so enormous in its domination, some may have thought it to be unsinkable. They are rocking it in a way that is making people uncomfortable, especially the people who are heavily invested in it. So now ask yourself these questions: What happens when a start up car company is outselling their competitors without placing a single ad? What happens when the public has so much confidence in a company that the stock is up more than 300% this year, and was up over 400% before the media went nuts with these headlines about the three fires?  What happens when two of the most powerful industries in the world - oil and the established car industry - feel threatened for the first time? In this country, the gigantic, powerful entity we call Big Oil made $51.5 billion in the second quarter of 2013. $51.5 billion in three months. Think about that number and then consider the internal combustion engine based car industry sold over 14 million cars in the USA last year. These two giants have been in bed with each other for a century: ""You drill for the oil, and we'll make the cars. Together, we'll make a fortune. Even if the people hate us, they will have to use our products because they will have no other choice.""  And now a little start up company named Tesla has come along and threatened all of that. We didn't expect these antiquated allies to go down without a fight. It's on.  Earlier this year in my home state of North Carolina, the state legislature was trying to pass a bill that would ban Tesla from selling cars in my state. That's right, as ridiculous as it sounds, North Carolina was trying to ban an American car manufacturer from selling cars in America. And they're not the only state that has tried this move: Texas, New York, Minnesota and Virginia all tried to pass similar bills. Do not underestimate the power of the establishment and the money they can throw around to influence politicians, journalists and campaigns. Who is behind these state efforts to ban Tesla sales? The National Auto Dealers Association. You know, the guys who have been selling us gasoline powered cars since - well, since you were born. Their chairman William Underriner stated to the press that NADA ""has a whole mess of lawyers in Washington"" to defend their franchise laws and prevent Tesla from selling cars directly to customers. He stated ""NADA has serious concerns about Tesla's intentions."" I can tell you what Tesla's intentions are: to sell an American built electric car to those who want them, at home and abroad. It's pretty simple, William. NADA partially succeeded in Texas where Tesla is allowed to have galleries but is banned from giving test drives or discussing prices with potential customers.  The fact that the giants of the world are fighting Tesla is a great sign. Consider the famous Gandhi quote ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" First they ignored Tesla, doubting that any startup American car company could challenge the big three. Then they laughed and said there was no market for a luxury electric car. Now they are fighting because Tesla is really starting to scare them now. And they should be scared because you know what comes next: Tesla wins. And win they will. Because they have a superior product. Because once you drive a Tesla, all other cars seem like antiques. Because their leader is a man who not only builds rocket ships, but also seems the most likely person to lead the team that will make the human race an interplanetary species. In other words, he's a very, very smart guy. Most importantly, they will win because the move to electric cars and sustainable transportation is an essential part of the evolution of humans to live in a way that doesn't destroy the world around us.  Grab the popcorn because this will be an epic battle - this is good vs. evil: new, clean renewable energy vs. old, dirty fossil fuels. This fight will be played out in the public for years to come. But follow the money and ask the important questions. When you see three Tesla fires with no injuries getting more headlines than 250,000 gasoline car fires, ask yourself why. Read between the lines, get the whole story. It's going to be a fight of epic proportions, but my bet is on Tesla Motors and Elon Musk. Who doesn't love a story where the good guy wins.",ENVIRONMENT,TECH
Layoffs Near At Carrier Factory 'Saved' By Trump,"Layoffs are set to begin next month at a Carrier factory in Indianapolis that made national news last year for making a deal with President Donald Trump to keep workers in Indiana.  The company said in a filing last month that 338 workers would be laid off on July 20. “The jobs are still leaving,” Robert James, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, told CNBC on Thursday. “Nothing has stopped.” The plant became a campaign talking point in February 2016 when the company announced 1,400 jobs would be moved to Mexico.  After the election, during the transition, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, announced a deal in which the company would keep nearly 1,000 jobs at the plant and invest $16 million in the facility in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years.  Not all of the jobs were saved.   “We are moving forward with our previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with expected completion by the end of 2017,” the company said at the time, according to the Indy Channel. The station reported that 600 jobs would move to Mexico. Trump said in December that the plant’s workers would have a “great Christmas” as a result of his deal. That won’t be the case this year. A letter filed with the Indiana Department of Workforce Development last month said an additional 290 jobs would be cut on Dec. 22. ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Some TV Golf Fan Cost Lexi Thompson A Title By Emailing An Infraction To Tour,"Who needs referees when we have TV viewers to officiate big-time sporting events? The LPGA decided a major tournament because a snitch of a golf fan notified the tour that Lexi Thompson incorrectly placed her ball back on the green by a sliver on a short putt, Deadspin reported. But wait, it gets crazier. The slightly errant ball placement happened on the 17th hole of Saturday’s ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, California. The viewer reportedly emailed the complaint during Sunday’s final round. Thompson, who was two strokes in the lead, was notified before the 13th hole that she would be penalized 4 strokes ― two for improper ball placement and two for an incorrect scorecard. “Is this a joke?” Thompson asked, per the Associated Press. Told it wasn’t, she snapped: “This is ridiculous.” Watch the infraction for yourself here: Video of @Lexi's apparent rules infraction yesterday. #ANAinspiration. pic.twitter.com/kl4CQefdY9 As word spread, Tiger Woods weighed in on Twitter, stating that “viewers at home should not be officials wearing stripes.” Viewers at home should not be officials wearing stripes.

That doesn't mean eating a plain head of broccoli (not that there's anything wrong with that). The Engine 2 Diet offers fat (and pleasure) from whole unprocessed foods like avocado, nuts and olives but has no added oil. ""It takes 1,375 olives you squeeze the dickens out to get 32 ounces of olive oil, discarding fiber, phytonutrients and you're left with 100 percent fat,"" Esselstyn explains. He's had good insider info about plant-based nutrition via his father Caldwell Esselstyn, the heart surgeon advocating a plant-based diet rather than stents and surgery in the documentary Forks Over Knives. ""I've respected and admired my father for so long,"" says Esselstyn. ""He was an Olympic gold medalist in 1956, with a bronze star in Vietnam. In fourth, fifth, sixth grades, I'd bring it to school for show and tell. He was such a role model for me. I feel a certain obligation to give back, to help people and do my part to help save lives.""     Esselstyn does it with his new book ""My Beef With Meat,"" which blasts through the wall of meat myths, marketing and misinformation. ""People don't get it. They think the answer is a pill."" It's not a pill, it's a plant -- lots of plants. In the book's short, pithy chapters, Esselstyn addresses the usual misconceptions people have about being vegan, including the old, tired you-won't-get-enough-protein issue (Still?  Really, people).   ""We're bombarded by marketing,"" he says. ""Every supermarket is a hunting ground with all these amazing different products -- eighty percent of them are unhealthy. Whole plant-based foods have been with us for eternity. We've gotten off the track.""  Esselstyn's spent much of the summer getting us back on track, partnering with Whole Foods for Farms 2 Forks, a series of empowering plant-based immersion retreats. The seminars cover everything from nutrition to cooking and have featured speakers including Esselstyn, his father, PCRM head Neal Barnard  and ""The China Study"" author T. Colin Campbell. They've drawn both plant-based newbies and longterm vegans, everyone ""passionate about taking their health to the next level,"" says Esselstyn. ""Their reaction gives me so much hope. Going down this path of a meatless diet has a ripple effect and it's profound and palpable,"" he says. ""There's something in the air and it's not a fad. This is a megatrend, this is here to stay.""

China 'Seriously Concerned' About U.S. Investigation Of Solar Imports,"BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China's commerce ministry called  on the United States on Sunday to stop anti-dumping  investigations into imports of solar power products from China,  expressing ""serious concern"" and vowing to defend its producers. U.S. trade officials on Thursday opened investigations into  imports of certain solar power products from China and Taiwan, a  move that could have a major impact on the nation's fast-growing  solar market. The U.S. Department of Commerce said it initiated  antidumping duty and countervailing duty investigations, which  will assess whether the products are being sold in the United  States below their fair value, or if their manufacturers receive  inappropriate levels of foreign government subsidies. ""The Chinese side expresses serious concern,"" the commerce  ministry said in a statement on its website. ""China urges the  United States again to carefully handle the current ...  investigations, be prudent in taking measures and terminate the  investigation proceedings."" China will assess the impact on its solar industry and  ""resolutely defend"" itself through various mechanisms, the  ministry said. The investigations were sparked by a complaint at the end of  last year by the U.S. unit of German solar manufacturer  SolarWorld AG . The company at the time said it was  seeking to close a loophole in a prior trade case that enabled  Chinese solar panel producers to evade duties by using cells  manufactured in other countries, mainly Taiwan. The Commerce Department investigation and a parallel inquiry  by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) could open the  door to expanding duties on some imported solar panels. In October 2012, the U.S. set steep duties on billions of  dollars of solar products from China, but turned down pleas to  expand the scope of its order to include Chinese panels made  with non-Chinese solar cells. In response, many Chinese module  producers simply began sourcing cells from Taiwan. The ITC is to make a preliminary ruling on whether there is  a reasonable indication that imports from China or Taiwan  materially injure, or threaten to injure, the local industry by  Feb. 14. A negative finding would stop the investigations. If the ITC determines that the imports could be hurting the  domestic industry, the Commerce department is to make  preliminary determinations about subsidies in March and dumping  in June.

'Moby Dick' May Be More Than Just A Whale Of A Tale,"Debate has swirled for nearly 200 years around whether sperm whales rammed whaling ships with their foreheads to sink them. Director Ron Howard's 2015 film, ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" details the story of such an attack in 1820 involving the gentle giants, which can reach up to more than 60 feet in length. The sinking of that American whaling ship -- the Essex -- was also the inspiration for Herman Melville's 1851 novel, ""Moby Dick.""  Now, new research suggests that the structure of a sperm whale's forehead evolved to function as a massive battering ram for when males compete with each other for mates. And this behavior might be capable of sinking ships without the whales hurting themselves during such a collision, according to a study, published in the peer-reviewed journal PeerJ on Tuesday. Researchers used simulations to determine if the structure of the forehead significantly reduces stress in a sperm whale's skull during impacts. The forehead of a sperm whale contains two large oil-filled compartments -- one called the ""spermaceti organ"" and the other known as ""junk"" -- that may play a role in these ocean creatures' ramming capabilities, the study found. This oil was the main target of the 19th century whaling industry. ""The forehead of the sperm whale is one of the strangest structures in the animal kingdom,"" said study lead author Dr. Olga Panagiotopoulou, an expert in the anatomy, bone biology and mechanics of large animals in a statement. ""Our findings show that connective tissue partitions within 'the junk' of the sperm whale forehead may function as a shock absorber."" The controversial theory that a sperm whale's head has a battering ram function emerged in the 19th century following a specific incident. ""After a large male rammed and sank his ship in the Pacific in 1820, whaler Owen Chase described the whale's head as admirably designed for this mode of attack,"" said Panagiotopoulou. ""Until our research, its mechanical feasibility had never been addressed. The scientific community received the ramming hypothesis with reluctance,"" she added. ""This was mainly because the front part of the sperm whale head houses sensitive anatomical structures that are essential for sonar communication between whales, and they would be in harm's way in a ramming event. Also, not many people had actually observed sperm whales ramming."" Conservation investigator Sandra Lanham sent the researchers a report last year detailing how she saw two sperm whales ramming while flying over the Gulf of California in 1997. The scientists now want to learn more about how whales are able to continue this activity while avoiding fatal skull fractures. ""Our study has limitations, but we hope it might stimulate future research to unravel the mechanical function of the head during head-butting events in other species, where aggressive behavior has been observed but remains unmodeled,"" Panagiotopoulou said.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
What Your Data Scientist Wishes You Knew,"By Daniel Wesley Big data: It’s the topic on everyone’s lips. Even high schoolers are clamoring to get into the data science field -- they realize jobs in the data sector are expected to grow more than sevenfold, totaling nearly 3 million positions by 2020. The demand for data experts is high, but will entrepreneurs be able to leverage relationships with their data scientists to create successful businesses? It’s a true concern: Leaders aren’t always great at communicating, and without a strong bond with their data scientists, entrepreneurs and small business leaders could find themselves unable to foster the trust necessary to reach their goals. In other words, you could find yourself with lots of data and no way to effectively relate to the person on your team who can manage it. It’s like finding an antique treasure chest without the key. Sure, you could forcefully pry it open, but that risks irreparable damage. It’s better to seek smooth access than court destruction and dismay. Why Math, Science and Tech Pros Perplex If you’ve spent half an hour with data scientists, you know they’re smarter than smart. These are folks who look at a set of random data points and see connections. They’re multifaceted and insightful. Still, they can be a frustrating lot from the viewpoint of a gregarious, sales-minded founder. The disconnect happens on numerous levels, starting with personality types. Data scientists tend to be introverts; rather than gab incessantly, they listen and respond selectively. They need to recharge in environments where they can process life alone. This flies in the face of extroverted creative types whose missions include copious amounts of chitchat. It also makes it tough to develop relational speaking points because data scientists don’t seek out the watercooler. Ironically, I’m an introvert myself, but I recognize the need to balance my tendencies with a cadre of extroverted friends and colleagues. However, many data scientists are more reticent to seek out outgoing co-workers. And while most busy entrepreneurs might be able to give up a Friday happy hour once a month, data scientists aren’t likely to join them for cocktails. On the flip side of the communication conundrum, data scientists don’t necessarily find the leaders of their companies any easier to comprehend. Those in the data field want to see passion flowing downward, creating a positive and energetic cultural environment that resonates with personnel. This energy motivates data workers and illustrates that they’re working for a higher purpose. Data scientists also want to feel the businesses they work for are led by confident, charismatic individuals who value people, not sheeple. An owner who is narrow-minded or closed to outside ideas will destroy the golden goose. Good leaders realize innovation -- fostered by new ways of thinking about ideas and products -- enables data teams to communicate new perspectives, so they push when warranted and step back when necessary. Both leaders and data scientists want to have trust. They just have to build that trust through specific relationship-building strategies. The Intersection Between Data Folks and Founders Want to strengthen your bond with your data scientist? The following suggestions work to create great and lasting relationships between data scientists and leaders. I should know: They’re based on my relationship with a data guru-turned-president, Rob Hunter. He and I might be night and day in terms of personalities, but that’s only ripened the connection we have. 1. Get personal. Immediately after hiring a data scientist, set up a time to share lunch or drinks. Focus on your one-on-one conversation and actively listen to your new employee. This opens the lines of communication organically. Don’t be aggressive; let the conversation flow from one topic to another and try to discover commonalities. Rob and I did this and just clicked. He saw that I thought like a fast-moving, triage-trained doctor because of my medical background, and I recognized that he was more of a stabilizer. Best of all, we bonded while talking about our families, despite our kids’ age differences -- mine were young, while his were ready for college. To this day, we still exchange small talk comfortably as friends. 2. Understand their motivators. What drives your data scientist? As a leader, it’s up to you to find out. The more you know, the more you can encourage their growth. Inquire about past projects and ask questions about how they like to operate. Determine what tools they need for efficiency and effectiveness, but don’t expect an introvert to give up this information without gentle prompting. I learned early that Rob’s motivations dovetailed with mine: overcoming the challenges of achieving business success. Being competitive types, we both like to win. We also both care deeply about providing for our families. We might have been in different places in our lives and had dissimilar career paths, but we could motivate each other because we understood our personal drivers. 3. Strive for relatable communication. Data scientists prefer hearing about tangible objectives, not pie-in-the-sky dreams. When you speak with data workers, be sure to explain what you want to see. As your relationship develops, figure out how to communicate your goals -- and your data scientist’s results -- in a way you can both understand. For me, everything relates to sports. Luckily, Rob’s no stranger to the lingo, so when he wanted to get a point across to me, he used sports analogies. We stayed on the same page, often using references like being a quarterback or winning the Super Bowl. Every business leader is destined to work with data scientists. Not sure you’re prepared to overcome the challenges inherent in developing relationships with talented data workers? Put a plan together and work at it. You’ll see results and sow the seeds of sincere camaraderie. -- Daniel Wesley founded Quote.com to provide consumers with auto insurance quotes from leading carriers.",SCIENCE,BUSINESS
Google Still A Long Way From Meeting Diversity Goals,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google on Thursday released data on its two-year-old initiative to create a more diverse U.S. workforce, saying it had more black, Latino and female employees but still lagged its goal of mirroring the population. The company released its diversity figures for the first time in 2014 and sparked a conversation among Silicon Valley tech companies that led many of its closest competitors to follow suit. Google's overall percentage of non-white, non-Asian employees in the United States did not move at all in 2015 from the year before, remaining at 2 percent for African Americans, 3 percent for Hispanics, 3 percent for multiracial individuals and less than 1 percent for Native American and Pacific Islanders, according to the company. Women made up 31 percent of Google's overall workforce in 2015, up 1 percent from 2014, and 21 percent of technical hires for the year, up from 19 percent in 2014. White employees made up 59 percent of its U.S. workforce and Asians accounted for 32 percent. Google had about 38,670 workers in the United States in 2015, according to its report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on August 2015 data. While its percentages of minority employees did not change, the report said in 2015 Google had 880 black employees, up from 628 in 2014 and 1,782 Hispanic employees, up from 1,428 the previous year. There were 712 multiracial individuals, up from 636, and 56 American Indian or Alaska natives, up from 44 the previous year. Google vice president of people operations Nancy Lee said the figures do not reflect where the company wants to be and said many small changes that do not show up in the statistics are having an impact. She pointed to conversations on diversity leading to a discussion on pay equity, which in turn resulted in a policy of paying employees according to position rather than by negotiated rates, which were often lower for women and minorities. ""It's a journey. We're a 60,000 person company and culture change takes time,"" said Google diversity coordinator Yolanda Mangolini. Other initiatives include a program where Google employees use work time to serve as instructors at historically black colleges and universities. The figures underscore challenges tech companies face in transforming cultures that critics say are too homogenous, white and male-dominated. The most recent diversity reports from Facebook and Twitter show similar trends to Google in employment of blacks and Latinos, while Apple did slightly better partially due to more diverse hiring at its retail stores. Those companies declined comment beyond their recent diversity reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. William Guillory, founder of organizational development firm Innovations International Inc., said progress is hampered by large tech companies using the same approaches to tap into a limited pool of talent. ""What I'm talking about is casting a wider net,"" he said. ""If [candidates] don't have the skill set you need why can't you create some kind of Google University component that adds the layer of skills you're looking for?"" Michael Solomon of tech talent agency 10X Management said he believes Silicon Valley companies have made sincere attempts to address the issue but need to try harder. ""I don't think these companies are going far out of their way to discriminate but I think they need to go far out of their way to hire diversely,"" he said.",TECH,TECH
New York Giants Bench Eli Manning As Disastrous Season Continues,"The New York Giants announced Tuesday that the team would bench star quarterback Eli Manning. Coach Ben McAdoo said backup quarterback Geno Smith would start in place of Manning as the team tries to revive a losing season. Manning has started in 210 consecutive regular-season games, a streak that’s second only to former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. McAdoo also mentioned giving rookie Davis Webb an opportunity to start as the team evaluates Smith in the next five weeks, according to the team’s website.  Manning, who has started every game since 2004, was gracious about the decision. “Coach McAdoo told me I could continue to start while Geno and Davis are given an opportunity to play,” Manning said in the team’s blog. “My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them. Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won’t finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak. Like I always have, I will be ready to play if and when I am needed. I will help Geno and Davis prepare to play as well as they possibly can.” The 36-year-old was visibly emotional speaking to reporters on Tuesday. Eli Manning fight back tears. Almost crying, tough to see #Giants pic.twitter.com/cHRTZYEXK4 The Giants have only two wins so far in a dismal season that has been marred by 19 player injuries, including to star wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall. The unexpected collapse of the team’s season have led to calls for McAdoo’s firing. The head coach, addressing the decision to bench his two-time Super Bowl MVP, spoke highly of Manning and commended his work to keep the team afloat. “I’ll say it again, I have the utmost respect for Eli and everything he has done for this organization throughout his career,” McAdoo said in the team’s blog. “He is the consummate professional. He doesn’t like the position we are in, and neither do any of us. Eli has had to deal with a lot this season.”",SPORTS,SPORTS
The Supreme Court Just Made It A Lot Harder For You To Sue Your Employer,"Employers who stiff their workers or discriminate against them just got a big lift from the Supreme Court, which issued a major ruling Monday making it easier for companies to avoid employee lawsuits. The 5-4 ruling upheld employers’ use of class-action waivers in arbitration agreements. By signing these controversial provisions, workers give up their right to band together and sue in court for back pay or damages, and are instead forced to take their disputes to arbitrators individually. Arbitration agreements have become a common way for employers to stifle lawsuits that could lead to large plaintiff classes and big payouts. Workers backed by employee groups and labor unions challenged their employers’ use of these agreements, claiming they ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, which guarantees workers the right to join forces in “mutual aid and protection.” The employer-friendly conservative majority on the court decided against the workers. They ruled that collective bargaining law does not supersede federal law that established the arbitration process, therefore making the class-action waivers in employment contracts legitimate. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for the conservative majority, saying Congress did not write the NLRA to “displace” federal arbitration law. “The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,” Gorsuch wrote.  The high court has previously ruled that companies can force consumers into arbitration agreements with class-action waivers, which are tucked into the fine print when you buy a plane ticket or sign up for a cell phone. The latest ruling effectively sanctions the use of these waivers in the workplace, a practice that has grown increasingly common over the last two decades. The Supreme Court ruling will have long-lasting implications for workers. Class-action lawsuits are often the most powerful way for employees to secure back pay when their minimum wage or overtime rights have been violated or to secure damages when their bosses run afoul of discrimination laws.  It’s harder to pursue these cases as a single worker than as part of a group, which is why employers prefer arbitration. Lawyers can be reluctant to file individual complaints in which the judgments or settlements will be small and not worth their time. Many workers are also hesitant to file their lawsuits as individuals, fearing their employers will ostracize or retaliate against them. In a strong dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision of the majority “egregiously wrong.” She argued that the rights under the NLRA include the right to pursue litigation collectively, and that an employer-dictated waiver would violate it. “Employees’ rights to band together to meet their employers’ superior strength would be worth precious little if employers could condition employment on workers signing away those rights,” Ginsburg wrote. During oral arguments last year, Justice Stephen Breyer said the case could undermine “the entire heart of the New Deal” by weakening collective action by workers. According to a report last year from the Economic Policy Institute, an estimated 25 million workers ― just under one-quarter of non-union employees in the private sector ― give up their right to join class-action lawsuits as a condition of employment. The report anticipated that waivers would become an “even more widespread practice” in the event the Supreme Court sanctioned them. The Supreme Court case, National Labor Relations Board v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., consolidated three separate cases involving different employers: the software company Epic Systems, the accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young, and the oil company and gas station chain Murphy Oil.  A former Murphy Oil employee, Sheila Hobson, claimed that when she worked at one of the company’s retail stores, she and her colleagues were required to do off-the-clock work they weren’t compensated for. They got together to sue the company for back pay. But when they consulted a lawyer, they learned they couldn’t take Murphy Oil to court as a group because they had already agreed to arbitration when they accepted their jobs. The National Labor Relations Board, the independent agency that enforces collective bargaining law, argued that the forced arbitration clause interfered with Hobson’s right to join together with other employees to improve their working conditions. The Obama White House agreed, filing a brief with the Supreme Court in support of Hobson. But that was under former President Barack Obama. After President Donald Trump was inaugurated, his administration took the extremely rare step of reversing a previous administration’s position on a sitting case before the court. Last June, Trump’s acting solicitor general filed a new brief in support of the employers in the case.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Eric Schneiderman Has Always Been A Con Man,"In November 2010, the Roosevelt Institute hosted an event in Washington taking a hard look at a strange phenomenon in U.S. housing. Banks, it appeared, were fabricating documents to pursue foreclosures under outrageous, chaotic circumstances ― not accepting mortgage payments, miscalculating debts, rewriting loan terms without consulting homeowners and trying to evict people who hadn’t missed payments. The event wasn’t a glitzy Washington spectacle. The guests of honor were stressed-out homeowners who showed up to detail their financial nightmares for a handful of journalists.  Sitting in the back and nodding along calmly was Eric Schneiderman, a promising young politician who had just been elected attorney general of New York. Afterward, he made the rounds shaking hands. This was an important issue, he told the reporters. He wasn’t a housing expert, but he didn’t trust the banks. Something had to be done. It would soon become clear that his masterly performance was a total con. There is perhaps no reputation in American politics over the past generation more undeserved than the acclaim that has surrounded Schneiderman as a principled, tough-on-white-collar-crime Democrat. After the Roosevelt Institute event, he pounded the microphones for months as a vocal holdout against President Barack Obama’s $25 billion national mortgage settlement ― a once-and-for-all agreement to put the foreclosure mess to rest. Schneiderman said the deal was no good; Obama was sweeping too much bad behavior under the rug and going too easy on the bad guys.  Then in January 2012, Schneiderman got his payoff: not a better mortgage deal but a big night in the spotlight. Obama invited Schneiderman to be a guest at the State of the Union address, where the president announced him as the leader of a new federal and state government task force prosecuting the fraud at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis.  In this role, Schneiderman issued a grand total of zero criminal subpoenas against U.S. financiers. If you want to know why nobody went to prison for wrecking the global economy in 2008, the answer, in no small part, is Schneiderman. Monday night’s gut-wrenching expose of his history of alleged physical abuse and psychological manipulation in his romantic life is a particularly violent, misogynist rendition of the behavior he demonstrated in his professional life. He toyed with and misled the American public about his white-collar-crime work for years and generally got away with it. Though his record against the rich and powerful is profoundly unimpressive, Schneiderman consistently scored incredible press from mainstream and liberal outlets ― nearly all of it based on bank fraud investigations that not only weren’t turning out convictions but weren’t even trying to generate prosecutions. In 2012, The Nation hailed him as “the right man” at “the right moment,” and The American Prospect heralded him as “The Man the Banks Fear Most” in a glowing cover story. New York magazine named him a pillar of the more-liberal-than-Obama left in a gushing 2013 profile, and Politico managed to twist the fact that he never seemed to actually do anything into a virtue, describing him as a “low key” champion of “methodical, behind-the-scenes” work who showed “a lack of interest in capitalizing on the office.” After Donald Trump was elected president, New York magazine again sang Schneiderman’s praises, and Politico called him “the leader of the Trump resistance.” In fairness, Schneiderman has been just as effective against Trump as against Wall Street. Schneiderman built this reputation by holding press conferences and inking splashy settlements with banks that added up to much less than their headlines suggested. He cut deals with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs that seemed to be worth over $41 billion to taxpayers but translated into only about $11.5 billion after various tax breaks, allowances and loopholes were considered, as David Dayen, who chronicled the entire ugly history of Schneiderman and the foreclosure fraud debacle in his book Chain of Title, explained in The New Republic. And Schneiderman proceeded to stand by as big banks racked up an astounding array of federal postcrisis regulatory violations that mysteriously never seemed to run afoul of state criminal law. All politicians stretch the truth. Every ambitious officeholder is guilty of chasing microphones. But it was a special brand of fraud to build his career by convincing the world that he was a champion of the very cause he was working to undermine. “His hypocrisy is epic,” one of his accusers, former girlfriend Michelle Manning Barish, told The New Yorker. “He’s fooled so many people.” She was talking about his support for the Me Too movement and other feminist causes, but she might as well have been describing his bank-busting persona.  But Democrats couldn’t let themselves see the fraud for what it was. He was the top prosecutor in New York, and no bankers had gone to prison, but people still clung to the belief that he was the man the media said he was ― so much so that friends of one alleged victim of his abuse even counseled her to “keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose,” according to The New Yorker. Schneiderman resigned Monday night, just hours after The New Yorker’s story came out. The Democratic Party didn’t lose a champion of anything.",POLITICS,BUSINESS
Facebook Sees Spike In Government Data Requests,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc <FB.O> said on Thursday that government requests for account data increased by 13 percent in the second half of 2015, with the United States and India topping the list. Government requests for account data increased to 46,763 from 41,214 in the first half of the year, the company said in a biannual report. The number of requests jumped 18 percent in the first half of the year. Government access to personal data from telephone and internet companies has become a bone of contention since former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified details of a program to collect bulk telephone metadata in 2013. Governments often request basic subscriber information, IP addresses or account content, including people's posts online. Facebook has about 1.65 billion regular users, or about one in every four people in the world. Facebook said about 60 percent of requests in the United States had a non-disclosure order prohibiting the company from notifying the user of the government request. This was the first time Facebook has included details on non-disclosure orders since it started issuing the global requests reports in 2013.

Smart Wheel By FlyKly Could Change Everything About Commuting,"The phrase “This changes everything” gets thrown around a lot, but in the sustainable commuting sphere, an invention out of New York by a group of bike enthusiasts just might actually change everything. The Smart Wheel by FlyKly Bikes is a motorized bike wheel that can fit on almost any bike, instantly turning a regular bike into an electric one, opening up the options of who can bike commute, where, how far and in what terrain.  Bike commuting in urban areas has the potential to combat an enormous number of problems: traffic congestion, air pollution, gas consumption, and commuting affordability. But would-be bikers are often limited by various constraints, including weather, physical condition, cost and time.  In most of the American cities with the worst traffic, such as Los Angeles, Houston, Honolulu or the Bay Area, commuters are constrained by hills, heat and sprawling distances.  Electric bikes, which have motors attached to them, were meant to solve some of those problems, but often end up being prohibitively expensive. Some e-bike lines’ most basic models start above $1200, and can easily surpass $2000.  So FlyKly’s Niko Klansek decided to “turn an ordinary bike into a smart bike.”  “We want to make cities more livable, and make them more people -- not car -- friendly,” says Klansek. Enter the Smart Wheel, a wheel that can replace almost any bike’s back tire. The wheel hub has a self-contained, battery-powered motor that can propel a bike at speeds as high as 20 miles per hour for as far as 30 miles on one charge. The wheel recharges itself when coasting downhill.  FlyKly hopes the Smart Wheel will encourage people to use their bikes at times they previously thought they could not. “Without losing your breath or breaking a sweat,” they promise, “there’s no need to worry about what to wear to that business meeting or 8 o’clock date.” The device earns its “Smart” moniker by being operated completely through one’s smartphone, which stays put on a handlebar mount (that also serves as a bike light and a phone charger) and connects to the wheel through Bluetooth. The FlyKly app monitors speed, distance, time traveled, location and route.   Before setting out on a ride, the cyclist sets the maximum speed at which they want to travel through the app. The wheel senses when the rider starts pedaling and adjusts speed accordingly. FlyKly says the app is also able to learn the rider’s cycling habits and routines and suggest “faster, safer, and more fun routes to take.” The wheel can be locked via the app, and if the bike starts to move when the phone is not nearby, the app sends a message alerting its owner to a possible theft.   FlyKly hopes users will also use the app to track their preferred routes and share them with city officials who may be planning bike lanes and trying to improve bike-friendliness in urban areas. The company’s goal with the Smart Wheel is to “reshape the cities ... in a way that again people, not cars, come first.”   Given the incredible early show of support, achieving their goal seems quite plausible. The company launched a kickstarter this October with a goal of raising $100,000. They have already raised over $275,000 and counting. Though FlyKly has not yet decided what the final price for the Smart Wheel will be, they assure it will be far less than an electric bicycle. Since the wheel is removable, the invention is also more versatile than an e-bike. After all, sometimes you want to be the one powering your bike with your own pedaling. But when you don’t, or can’t, Smart Wheel will be there. ",ENVIRONMENT,TECH

The site currently features maps of Boston, New York, Barcelona, Madrid and London. Users can click on streets in each city to see what kinds of sounds dominate in that area.  Using what researchers call an ""urban sound dictionary,"" the maps trawl geo-located Flickr photos for tags associated with particular noises. Those sound-related tags are broken into five categories -- transport, nature, human, music and mechanical -- and create visual sound profiles. The maps also link those sounds to particular emotions, giving users a sense of what it might feel like to walk down a particular street.  Though users can only see complete sound profiles for specific streets, the color-coded maps (red for traffic sounds, green for nature, orange for music, blue for people, gray for mechanical) helps give a general idea of what you might hear if you were to walk from street to street in a particular neighborhood.  For instance, New York's Upper West Side, a wealthy residential area near Central Park, appears to be full of nature sounds: (Click here to play with interactive versions of the maps.) Researchers also used geo-located photo tags to attach sounds to specific emotions. They found, for instance, that streets defined by musical sounds were linked to feelings of joy or sadness, whereas traffic sounds were tied to fear and anger.  The latter isn't surprising. Research on urban sound has found that noise pollution is correlated with everything from sleep impairment to cardiovascular disease. This section of New York's Park Avenue, a busy thoroughfare, is dominated by transport sounds associated with surprise, sadness and fear: But other urban sounds, from church bells to street vendors, can also calm, exhilarate or inspire. The sounds of St. Mark's Place, a street near The Huffington Post's New York City offices, come mostly from humans. The street also contains music, nature and transport sounds, giving it a joyful feel, according to Chatty Maps.",TECH,TECH
NASA Launches GOES-R Weather Satellite,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Nov 19 - A U.S. weather satellite that will “revolutionize” forecasting blasted off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral on Saturday, promising to deliver continuous high-definition views of hurricanes and other storms over the Western Hemisphere. A detailed stream of images provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen weather forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Carried atop an Atlas 5 rocket, the GOES-R satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:42 p.m. EST. #GOESR is currently in a coast phase while it heads toward geo orbit. In the meantime, check out this photo of the satellite leaving Earth! pic.twitter.com/VBeT2xKT6i The launch was delayed an hour to resolve a technical issue with the rocket, developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. , said NASA launch commentator Mike Curie. A second, unrelated issue also contributed to the delay. Once in position 22,300 miles (35,888 km) above the equator, GOES-R is designed to take a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on specific regions to monitor fires, volcanic eruptions, heavy rainfall and storms. The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. “This is a quantum leap,” Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a press conference on Thursday. “It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.” The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built Exelis Inc., a subsidiary of Harris Corp . It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, said NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman. The satellite’s capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides.  Go #GOESR! With spacecraft separated & solar arrays deployed, satellite is on its way to boost weather observations: https://t.co/FpLMvoHby4 pic.twitter.com/UL2PjqCOhn GOES-R, built by Lockheed, includes the first operational lightning mapper, which will image lightning fields in the western hemisphere 200 times a second, NOAA said. It is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said.

Watch O.J. Simpson's Parole Hearing Live Here,"After serving over eight years in prison for his role in a 2007 armed robbery inside a Las Vegas hotel, O.J. Simpson will go before the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners on Thursday to plead his case as to why he should be released as early as October. The hearing will be streamed live on various sites, according to the board, and we’ll make sure to keep one running on this page. The hearing begins at 1 p.m. ET at the board’s office in Carson City, Nevada. Simpson will dial in via video conference from Nevada’s Lovelock Correctional Center, where he is imprisoned.  Simpson, 70, will speak to the same four board members who granted him parole on some of his charges in 2013. They will consider factors including “Simpson’s age, whether his conviction was for a violent crime, his prior criminal record and his plans after release” when deciding whether to grant him further parole, the board has said. Legal experts widely expected Simpson to be informed that he will be released from prison on Thursday, including now-retired district attorney David Roger, who served as prosecutor in the Simpson case. In 2008, Simpson received a nine-to-33-year prison sentence for charges including armed robbery and kidnapping as a result of a group effort to steal memorabilia from two men inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Four of the other men involved in the crime only ever received probation, and a fifth was released from prison in 2011. Many have described Simpson’s near-decade-long imprisonment as unspoken retribution for his acquittal in the murder of his estranged wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman in 1994. ",SPORTS,POLITICS
Donald Trump Can't Stop Attacking Black Sports Figures,"Saturday morning, President Donald Trump attempted to rescind a White House invitation he apparently had never extended, when he tweeted that Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry was no longer welcome to make the customary visit to celebrate the team’s NBA championship. Curry, Trump said, was “hesitating” to commit to the trip ― an obvious falsehood, considering that the point guard had on Friday stated plainly that he had no interest in visiting the president. The tweet followed Trump’s Friday night attack on NFL players who, inspired by the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have spent the last year protesting racial injustice and police brutality during the national anthem. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” Trump said at a rally in Alabama. “Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’”  That, meanwhile, followed the White House’s decision last week to call for the firing of ESPN anchor Jemele Hill, who in a series of tweets had called the president a “white supremacist.” Curry, Hill, and the vast majority of NFL players who have protested during the anthem, like Kaepernick, of course, are all African-Americans. In the span of less than two weeks, the president of the United States has used his bully pulpit three times to attack prominent black sports figures. That is a remarkable and improper use of presidential power. But it is not at all surprising that sports figures have become the focus of Trump’s ire.  From boxer Jack Johnson to the University of Wyoming’s Black 14, from Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges, America has a long tradition of black athletes taking a stand against racial injustice. Black protest in sports tends to take the form of a freighted absence — Ali gone from boxing for three years; Abdul-Rauf in the locker room during the national anthem. Curry’s pointed withdrawal from the White House visit is of a piece with Kaepernick’s choice to sit during the anthem, which subsequently led the league to blackball him. ESPN, in its frantic attempts to keep Hill off the air, nearly created a charged absence right in the middle of its afternoon programming block. It was only a matter of time before the racial reaction embodied by Trump’s presidency would explode across the sports landscape. There are few places in America where black people are more visible and their voices more audible than in the NFL and NBA, and on ESPN. Seventy percent of NFL players are black. Nearly three quarters of NBA players are. ESPN, for all its other faults, is by far the most racially diverse sports media outlet on the planet. Echoes of the white grievance that powered the Trump campaign can be heard, for instance, in the complaints about ESPN’s liberal tendencies, a polite euphemism for the network’s blackness. They can be heard, too, in the furious response to Kaepernick’s protest, in which athletes represent an ascendant black power that is ungrateful for the opportunities extended to them, and wrong for pointing out the obvious racial injustices that still exist in the country. The backlash is fueled by the belief that, in return for million-dollar salaries and the fragile affections of many white fans, black sports figures are required to sacrifice their basic humanity and their right to participate in civic society. Curry and Kaepernick and Hill broke that unspoken agreement. “What we do with the black athlete is say, ‘This is what you get,’” said Louis Moore, an author and history professor at Grand Valley State University. “We take these black athletes and say, ‘Look, they’ve made it! Anybody can make it in America!’” “But the moment they speak up,” he continued, “they become problematic.” Trump was speaking to this very sense of grievance in his follow-up tweets: If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect.... ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do! Trump and his supporters demand that athletes “stick to sports” on the premise that sports are not an acceptable arena for any discussion of social injustice, as if any other venue would be, as if sports themselves weren’t already deeply political, as if American sports weren’t the domain of government-abetted monopolists enjoying a set of power arrangements that—as athletes point out from time to time, to national opprobrium—aren’t as far removed from the plantation as we’d like to think. When Hill pointed out the plain fact that Trump is a white supremacist whose presidency is based on white supremacy, she knew what she was talking about. She covers sports, after all. That they are rich and famous does not insulate black sports figures from America’s racist legacy, as is demonstrated by the cases of NBA player Thabo Sefolosha, former NFL running back Warrick Dunn, or former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin, whose cousin was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. Trump has drawn such a forceful rebuke from so many athletes precisely because his words and policies directly affect them too. In targeting Hill, Curry and NFL players like Kaepernick, Trump was goosing his small but fervent base of supporters, people who do not want to confront America’s racial realities through sports or anywhere else. But if this weekend’s immediate response is any indication, Trump’s comments will only embolden athletes to take an even more forceful stance against him and what he represents. Numerous NFL players have already spoken out against his speech in Alabama. LeBron James called Trump a “bum” for his criticism of Curry. The NFL Players Association said that its members “can no longer afford to stick to sports.” North Carolina’s title-winning basketball team announced it would not visit the White House. And when a Twitter commenter asked Reggie Bush if he thought even more players would start kneeling during the national anthem, the former NFL running back responded only, “Yes.” The absence is growing. ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Stand — Or Kneel — For Something,"I’d rather be in with the “sons of bitches” than the “very fine people.” Please #TakeTheKnee. I don’t know why any NFL player would be reading my words, but if you are, unite around this cause — and heck, everyone, take a knee! If peaceful protests did not produce results, those in power would not work tirelessly to silence them. Take a knee for justice not oppression, for unity not divisiveness, for respect not racism, for humanity not white supremacy, for equality not inequity, for inclusion not discrimination, for freedom of speech not suppression, for love not hatred, for peace not violence or police brutality, for the America that CAN be not the one put forth by the President, for black lives not black men and women being flagrantly gunned down in the streets and disproportionately locked up in prisons. If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention. What is right is often not (rarely) popular, welcomed or easy; that does not make it one iota less important, necessary or critical. Do not forget Trump’s divisive words, do not become distracted by his antics, do not let his offensive behavior slide, do not overlook his racist and white supremacist patterns, do not normalize any of the President’s unconscionable actions, of which this is just the latest heinous disgrace. Repeatedly insisting and claiming to not be racist, while saying and doing things that appeal directly to a racist base and employing rhetoric to unmistakably stoke fires of division, is racism in action; attacking black athletes and influencers should not be good politics for anyone. Donald Trump’s “logic” on the NFL – like so much he spews, champions or puts forth – is twisted, dangerous, pathetic, disheartening, tragic, sickening, backwards, racist, terrifying and plain wrong. Why is Trump focused on THIS (or attempting to distract the public) when well over 3.5 million American citizens are without power, struggling, suffering in Puerto Rico, plus millions more across Florida, Texas and the US Virgin Islands, in additions to countless fellow human beings, struck by natural disaster in the past couple of weeks? The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Not only can we speak openly, express our beliefs, demonstrate peacefully, protest injustice, rather we are called upon to do all of that and more. Those are the precise values and rights for which our brave, patriotic men and women in uniform continue to risk their lives, even make the ultimate sacrifice, to protect and defend. Please note, kneeling before the flag does not violate the US Flag Code Chapter 10 Respecting the Flag. However, the following are direct conduct violations: carrying the flag flat or horizontally; wearing it as apparel, bedding or drapery; using it for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever; embroidering it on cushions or handkerchiefs; impressing it on paper napkins or anything for temporary use; using any part in an athletic uniform or costume. But NOT taking a knee. Twenty-seven players and staff boldly and courageously took a knee before the Jaguars-Ravens football game, many more linked arms in solidarity. That is the most ever, including Shad Khan, the only non-white owner in the NFL who also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration; I guess he won’t be firing any of those players, defying Donald Trump’s call to his owner friends to “get that son of a bitch off the field right now” in his now infamous speech. Stevie Wonder set the tone when he took a knee for America at the Global Citizen festival yesterday. The Oakland A’s Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel during the national anthem, marking what I believe will be an expansion of the emblematic physical statement into other sports. I suspect we will be seeing hundreds of players, staff and fans demonstrate before today’s NFL games – and can only hope that white players recognize the importance of being an ally and accomplice in this struggle for human rights, of using white privilege for the benefit of our brothers and sisters, of defending dignity on the field and off. This is not merely about solidarity or football or the flag; we are all tied together in the common fabric of destiny, an inalienable truth. Countless players are talented, proactive, leading, philanthropic citizens, forces for good who care deeply and serve communities around the country – and may that only continue to deepen, thereby inspiring, educating, mobilizing and empowering the masses. Professional athletes are role models for millions of people of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, ages, genders, faiths, politics who are watching, listening and taking note. I am proud to see leadership, teams, owners, players, commentators, leagues, coaches, human beings strongly and vocally support “peaceful pursuits of positive change” and social justice, to borrow a phrase from the statement of the San Francisco 49ers, leading the way alongside our other Bay Area teams. May this not only shift the culture of the NFL and sports, but far more importantly, that of the United States of America – to be one of justice and equity, safety and freedom for all. Get political. Get active. Get woke. Stand – or kneel – for something, for anything, for everything.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Microsoft Fights U.S. Government Over Data Requests,"Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails, the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents. The government’s actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and Microsoft's First Amendment right to free speech. The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing, spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. Microsoft’s suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people's computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data. Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says in the lawsuit. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated. “People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,” Microsoft says in the lawsuit. It adds that the government “has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.” SURVEILLANCE BATTLE The lawsuit represents the newest front in the battle between technology companies and the U.S. government over how much private businesses should assist government surveillance. By filing the suit, Microsoft is taking a more prominent role in that battle, dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in recent months due to the government’s efforts to get the company to write software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a December massacre in San Bernardino, California. Apple, backed by big technology companies including Microsoft, had complained that cooperating would turn businesses into arms of the state. ""Just as Apple was the company in the last case and we stood with Apple, we expect other tech companies to stand with us,"" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a phone interview after the suit was filed. One security expert questioned Microsoft's motivation and timing. Its lawsuit was “one hundred percent motivated by business interests” and timed to capitalize on an increase in customer privacy issues spurred in part by Apple’s dispute, said D.J. Rosenthal, a former White House cyber security official in the Obama administration. In its complaint, Microsoft says over the past 18 months it has received 5,624 legal orders under the ECPA, of which 2,576 prevented Microsoft from disclosing that the government is seeking customer data through warrants, subpoenas and other requests. Most of the ECPA requests apply to individuals, not companies, and provide no fixed end date to the secrecy provision, Microsoft said. Microsoft and other companies won the right two years ago to disclose the number of government demands for data they receive. This case goes farther, requesting that it be allowed to notify individual businesses and people that the government is seeking information about them. Increasingly, U.S. companies are under pressure to prove they are helping protect consumer privacy. The campaign gained momentum in the wake of revelations by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 that the government routinely conducted extensive phone and Internet surveillance to a much greater degree than believed. Microsoft’s lawsuit comes a day after a U.S. congressional panel voted unanimously to advance a package of reforms to the ECPA. Last-minute changes to the legislation removed an obligation for the government to notify a targeted user whose communications are being sought. Instead, the bill would require disclosure of a warrant only to a service provider, which retains the right to voluntarily notify users, unless a court grants a gag order. It is unclear if the bill will advance through the Senate and become law this year. Separately, Microsoft is fighting a U.S. government warrant to turn over data held in a server in Ireland, which the government argues is lawful under another part of the ECPA. Microsoft argues the government needs to go through a procedure outlined in a legal-assistance treaty between the U.S. and Ireland. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) is fighting a separate battle in federal court in Northern California over public disclosure of government requests for information on users. The case is Microsoft Corp v United States Department of Justice et al in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:16-cv-00537.",TECH,TECH
"Aaron Hernandez Had Most Severe CTE Ever Found For Someone His Age, Researchers Say","Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez had the most severe case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ever discovered in someone his age, researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine disclosed at a conference Thursday. Dr. Ann McKee, the director of the school’s CTE center, said the 27-year-old’s brain was “clearly at the severe end of the spectrum” for his age group, diagnosing Hernandez with Stage 3 CTE (out of 4), which hasn’t been seen before in brains younger than 46 years old. Hernandez died of an apparent suicide earlier this year while serving a life sentence for homicide. In the troubled years before his arrest, Hernandez reportedly became extremely paranoid, began regularly using PCP, and carried a gun with him at all times.   CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head trauma, and is commonly diagnosed in players of high-impact sports like football and boxing. The damage in particular affected Hernandez’s frontal lobes, McKee said, a region of the brain associated with decision-making, judgment and cognition.  Symptoms of CTE include impulse control problems, aggression, depression and paranoia, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. McKee cautioned attendees that a CTE diagnosis alone is insufficient in explaining all of Hernandez’s behavior, but it does offer a significant clue. “We can’t take the pathology and explain the behavior,” McKee said, according to commentary relayed by The Washington Post. “But we can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE, and CTE of this severity, have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses for aggression, emotional volatility, rage behaviors. We know that collectively.” A Boston University study of 202 brains of deceased American football players earlier this year found CTE in 87 percent of them, with the number climbing to 99 percent among NFL players. “It is no longer debatable whether or not there is a problem in football; there is a problem,” McKee said in a statement at the time. ”[It] is time to come together to find solutions.” ",SPORTS,SPORTS
Report: White House Will Not Publicly Back Encryption Legislation,"The White House is declining to offer public support for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies such as Apple Inc to help law enforcement crack encrypted data, sources familiar with the discussions said. The decision all but assures that the years-long political impasse over encryption will continue even in the wake of the high-profile effort by the Department of Justice to force Apple to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last December's shootings in San Bernardino, California. President Obama suggested in remarks last month that he had come around to the view that law enforcement agencies needed to have a way to gain access to encrypted information on smartphones. But the administration remains deeply divided on the issue, the sources said. The draft legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican chair and top Democrat respectively of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is expected to be introduced as soon as this week. The bill gives federal judges broad authority to order tech companies to help the government but does not spell out what companies might have to do or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help, according to sources familiar with the text. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance. Although the White House has reviewed the text and offered feedback, it is expected to provide minimal public input, if any, the sources said. Its stance is partly a reflection of a political calculus that any encryption bill would be controversial and is unlikely to go far in a gridlocked Congress during an election year, sources said. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the pending legislation, but referred to White House press secretary Josh Earnest's statements on encryption legislation. Last month Earnest said the administration is ""skeptical"" of lawmakers' ability to resolve the encryption debate given their difficulty in tackling ""simple things."" Tech companies and civil liberties advocates have opposed encryption legislation, arguing that mandating law enforcement access to tech products will undermine security for everyone. Several lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, have vowed to oppose any attempt to limit encryption protections in U.S. technology products. Even some intelligence officials worry that enabling law enforcement agencies to override encryption will create more problems than it solves by opening the door to hackers and foreign intelligence services. Some also say it is unnecessary because the government has other means of getting the information it needs. The Justice Department dropped its legal action against Apple last week, saying it had found a way to hack into the phone. The White House last year backed away from pursuing legislation that would require U.S. technology firms to provide a ""back door"" to access encrypted data. The backpedaling resembled a retreat by President Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s on efforts to require a special computer chip in phones to give the U.S. government a way to monitor encrypted conversations. But the desire for encryption legislation among some intelligence and law enforcement officials has never gone away, and it gained new life after the Islamist militant-inspired attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Obama, speaking at the South by Southwest entertainment festival in Austin, Texas, last month, warned against ""fetishizing our phones"" and said that doing nothing to address law enforcement's encryption challenges ""can't be the right answer."" Obama, however, also cautioned against Congress taking any action that would be ""sloppy and rushed."" Apple and others have called on Congress to help find a solution to the problem of criminals and terrorists using encryption to avoid surveillance. A separate proposal to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue is also not expected to be enacted this year. Meanwhile, tech companies are stepping up their efforts to implement encryption and other security measures. The Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp announced this week that it had implemented complete encryption of its service - and now cannot get access to customer messages even if was ordered to by a court.",TECH,TECH
"Net Neutrality Rules Will End In June, FCC Says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said in a notice on Thursday that landmark 2015 U.S. open-internet rules will cease on June 11, and new rules handing providers power over what content consumers can access will take effect. The FCC in December repealed the Obama-era “net neutrality” rules, allowing internet providers to block or slow websites as long as they disclose the practice. The FCC said the new rules will take effect on June 11. A group of states and others have sued to try to block the new rules from taking effect. The revised rules were a win for internet service providers like AT&T Inc (T.N) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) but are opposed by internet firms like Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). “The agency failed to listen to the American public and gave short shrift to their deeply held belief that internet openness should remain the law of the land,” FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said Thursday. “The FCC is on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American people.” The U.S. Senate is set to vote as early as next week on whether to reject the FCC repeal of the net neutrality rules - but that effort faces an uphill battle. Proponents currently have the backing of 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with Democrats, as well as Republican Senator Susan Collins. With the prolonged absence of Republican Senator John McCain due to illness, proponents believe they will win on a 50-49 vote. Senator Ed Markey said it was “likely” the vote will take place in the middle of next week. On Wednesday, senators officially filed a petition to force a net neutrality vote and 10 hours of floor debate under the Congressional Review Act. Following the FCC announcement, Markey wrote on Twitter, “the Senate must act NOW and pass my resolution to save the internet as we know it.” The FCC voted 3-2 to reverse Obama-era rules barring service providers from blocking, slowing access to or charging more for certain online content. Once they take effect, the new FCC rules would give internet service providers sweeping powers to change how consumers access the internet but include new transparency requirements that require them to disclose any changes to consumers. If the Senate approves the measure, it would not likely pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. If the legislation were to pass the House, President Donald Trump would be expected to veto it. In February, a coalition of 22 state attorneys general refiled legal challenges intended to block the Trump administration’s repeal of net neutrality. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has often said he is confident the agency’s order will be upheld. Democrats have said they believe the issue would be key in November’s midterm congressional elections, especially among younger internet-savvy voters. Republicans have said the FCC repeal would eliminate heavy-handed government regulations, encourage investment and return the internet to pre-2015 rules.",POLITICS,TECH

The Federal Reserve Board: The Best Weapon Against Discrimination?,"Most people have little understanding of the Federal Reserve Board. This is unfortunate because it has an enormous impact on the economy and therefore on people’s lives. The Fed’s decisions on interest rate policy can slow the rate of the economy’s growth and bring job creation to a halt, if they choose. Conversely, if the Fed adopts an interest policy to foster growth, then millions more people can have jobs. The Fed’s impact in this area is not just a question of aggregate job numbers. After all, adding another one million jobs in a labor market with 150 million jobs may not seem like a very big deal. However the job growth that we see as the labor market tightens overwhelmingly benefits the most disadvantaged groups in society. The additional jobs go disproportionately to those with less education and also to workers who face discrimination in the labor market, specifically African American and Hispanic workers. Along with the increase in job opportunities, these workers are also likely to see more wage gains since the stronger job market improves their bargaining position. A few years back, Jared Bernstein and I wrote a book on the benefits of full employment that emphasized this point about full employment — offering especially large benefits for the disadvantaged. A new paper from the Federal Reserve Board made the same point with additional data and analysis. The basic point is that a high employment economy is an effective way to reduce racial discrimination in the labor market. While a low unemployment rate should not be an excuse for abandoning policies explicitly designed to combat racial discrimination in the labor market — it is a very effective tool, especially at a time when other channels may be blocked. We see clear evidence of the benefits over the last three years. The members of the Federal Reserve Board’s Open Market Committee (FOMC), which decides interest rate policy, are regularly surveyed about their estimate for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or NAIRU. This is in principle the lowest the unemployment rate can go before inflation starts to spiral upward. In the survey given three years ago, the range of estimates from FOMC members went from 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent. Today, the unemployment rate is 4.4 percent. Furthermore, inflationary pressures by almost every measure have weakened in the last year, suggesting that the unemployment rate could go even lower without causing inflation to be a problem. But it’s worth asking what would have happened if the inflation hawks among the FOMC had gotten their way. This would have meant that the Fed would have raised interest rates sooner and faster, preventing the unemployment rate from getting below their projections for the NAIRU. If we start at the more optimistic 5.2 percent number, the economy reached this level of unemployment in July of 2015. At that time the employment-to-population ratio (EPOP) for African Americans was 55.9 percent. (This is the percentage of African Americans over age 16 that have jobs.) In the most recent data, the EPOP for African Americans was 57.6 percent. This translates into another 560,000 African Americans with jobs. The EPOP for African American teens stands at 24.4 percent in the most recent data, a full four percentage points above its July 2015 level. While this is still a low level, it means the probability of an African American teen having a job is 20 percent greater than if the unemployment rate had been kept from falling below the 5.2 percent estimate for the NAIRU. Of course the story would be considerably worse if the inflation hawks on the FOMC, with their 6.0 percent NAIRU estimate, had gotten their way. There is a similar story with Hispanics. Their EPOP is 62.9 percent today, compared to 61.4 percent in July of 2015. This difference translates into another 620,000 jobs for Hispanic workers. These points are especially important now, because Donald Trump is about to make his first appointment to the Federal Reserve Board. His pick is Marvin Goodfriend, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Goodfriend has been a consistent critic of the policies pursued by the Federal Reserve Board (and Congress) to try to speed the recovery and lower unemployment. It is a safe bet that he would be among the inflation hawks that would be looking to slow the economy and reduce the rate of job creation. The Republicans have a majority in the Senate, which makes it likely that Goodfriend will be approved for this position. But it is important that the public know how much is at stake with this appointment. If Goodfriend joins the FOMC, he is likely to be a major force against using the Fed’s power to reduce the extent of racial discrimination in the labor market.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Rudy Giuliani's ABC Interview Was A Mess. Here Are The Biggest Takeaways.,"Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who recently joined President Donald Trump’s legal team, sat down with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos on Sunday for a wide-ranging, eyebrow-raising interview. Giuliani appeared on ABC’s “This Week” following his explosive revelation on Fox News last week that Trump had reimbursed Michael Cohen, the president’s personal attorney, for the $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump, who had previously denied all knowledge of the payment, suggested Friday that Giuliani didn’t have “his facts straight.” Giuliani quickly backpedaled, saying during a Fox News appearance on Saturday that he was “still learning” about the case. On Sunday, he continued to sow confusion about what he knows. Here were some of the biggest takeaways from his ABC interview: “We don’t have to,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump would comply. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” Mueller reportedly warned Trump’s lawyers in March that he had the power to issue a subpoena if the White House refused his request to have a sit-down interview with the president as part of the federal investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, rejected that argument on CNN later Sunday. “He’s going to need to comply with a subpoena,” he told the network’s Jake Tapper. “If they take that case to court, they’re going to lose.” Pres. Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos “we don’t have to” comply with a potential subpoena from the special counsel, adding “He's the President of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” https://t.co/R6JsMQN9yM pic.twitter.com/RX6MLYeQ2e “Every lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify,” Giuliani said. “I’ve got a client who wants to testify. ... I hope we get a chance to tell him the risk that he’s taking.” Giuliani also said he expects Cohen to “cooperate” with prosecutors in the Russia probe, and claimed pardoning him if he’s indicted or convicted of a crime is “obviously not on the table.” “It has not been discussed, and would not be discussed” Giuliani said. “I’m a big believer in the pardon power. ... But right now, pardons would be a bit ― they wouldn’t be illegal to talk about, they’d be kind of confusing.” Either way, Giuliani said it’s time for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to shut down Mueller’s investigation. “There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” he said. “I happen to believe it’s greater than anybody realizes.” President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos a pardon for Michael Cohen “is not on the table. That isn’t a decision to be made now. There’s no reason to pardon anybody now… It has not been discussed.” https://t.co/bKAHeA5LAy pic.twitter.com/KFOz6yeJTM Giuliani said last week that Trump first found out about the payment to Daniels― whose real name is Stephanie Clifford― several weeks ago, but claimed Sunday that he was less certain of the timeline.  “I don’t know when the president learned about it,” he said. “The reality is those are not facts that worry me as a lawyer. Those don’t amount to anything ― what is said to the press. That’s political.” “It’s okay to lie to the press?” Stephanopoulos interrupted. “Gee, I don’t know,” Giuliani responded. “You know a few presidents who did that. I don’t think that this president has done that. But in any event, that’s not the crime.”  Rudy Giuliani on @ThisWeekABC: ""What is said to the press, that's political.""George Stephanopoulos: ""It's okay to lie to the press?""Giuliani: ""Uh...gee, I don't know."" pic.twitter.com/VjrmQO7aUK “I never thought $130,000 was a real payment ― it’s a nuisance payment,” Giuliani said. “I don’t like saying this, but it’s not a great deal of money ― $1.3 million is a great deal of money,” he continued. “That’s the kind of money you would think of as a settlement. If I saw $130,000, I would never think it was to settle a substantial claim against my client.”  Giuliani smears Daniels as ""woman you saw on SNL last nite trying to make more money,"" then adds this gem: ""I know this sounds funny to people at home - I never thought $130k was a real payment. It's a nuisance payment...People don't go away for $130k if it's a meritorious claim"" pic.twitter.com/WdRnFeaElp “I have no knowledge of that, but I would think if it was necessary, yes,” Giuliani said. “[Cohen] made payments for the president or he conducted business for the president.” Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she didn’t personally know about payments other than the one to Daniels, though she also added a caveat. If such payments were made, “they didn’t cross my desk as campaign manager” in the 2016 election, Conway told Jake Tapper. Did Michael Cohen make payments to other women on behalf of the president? Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos: “I have no knowledge of that, but I would think if it was necessary, yes."" https://t.co/R6JsMQN9yM pic.twitter.com/Ol0Hpb0Xp9 Giuliani told multiple news outlets last week that Cohen had complained after the 2016 election about Trump not reimbursing him for the Daniels payment. But Giuliani appeared to downplay those statements Sunday, calling Cohen’s alleged complaints just “one of the rumors.”  “But that’s what you said,” Stephanopoulos said. “You stated it as fact.” “Well maybe I did,” Giuliani responded. “I don’t know. How do you separate fact and opinion?” While discussing whether Trump would testify in the Russia probe, Giuliani claimed the special counsel’s team was behind a New York Times report that featured 49 questions Mueller wants to ask the president. But Stephanopoulos pushed back on that theory. “Those questions were written by [Trump attorney] Jay Sekulow after a meeting with Mueller and his team,” Stephanopoulos told Giuliani. “And these were ... the impression of the Trump team’s take on the questions, and in fact it was a document made by the Trump team. It wasn’t something leaked by Mueller.” “Could it have been somebody formerly on our side? Could it have been somebody formerly on theirs? I don’t know,” Giuliani responded. “Main fact is I don’t care. My client’s prejudiced by that, but in a way we were helped by it.” As expected, Daniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, was waiting in the wings to skewer Giuliani over his “train wreck” of an interview Sunday. “It’s an absolute, unmitigated disaster for Rudy Giuliani and the president,” Avenatti said. “I can’t believe that that actually just happened. I mean, what we witnessed by Rudy Giuliani may be one of the worst TV appearances by any attorney on behalf of a client in modern times.” Stormy Daniels’ attorney @MichaelAvenatti calls Giuliani’s interview with @GStephanopoulos, “an absolute, unmitigated disaster for Rudy Giuliani and the president… I think it is obvious to the American people that this is a cover-up; that they are making it up as they go along.” pic.twitter.com/cURpRlV3Ce Nick Visser contributed to this report.",POLITICS,POLITICS

Watch A Year Flash Before Your Eyes From 1 Million Miles Away,"One year ago, NASA treated earthlings to a magnificent view of our home planet from a vantage point some 1 million miles away. Since then, the agency’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera ― appropriately nicknamed EPIC ― has captured thousands of dazzling photographs. And on Wednesday, NASA blew our minds again with the release of a stunning time-lapse image, built from more than 3,000 photos, showing a full year of Earth’s dizzying dance. EPIC, which is attached to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Deep Space Climate Observatory, takes a color image of the sunlit side of Earth about every two hours. The camera’s vantage point allows it to view sunrise and sunset at least 13 times per day, as lead scientist Jay Herman explains in the new video.  Beyond their evident beauty, EPIC’s photos “will be used to study the daily variations of features over the entire globe, helping us to better understand ― and protect ― our home planet,” Herman says. NASA researchers will be able to measure cloud height, ozone and aerosol levels, vegetation and more.  If you need us, we’ll be contemplating our tiny existence on this planet we call home.",SCIENCE,SCIENCE

"Internet Energy Efficiency: NRDC Study Questions Power Drain From Routers, Modems","From Mother Nature Network's Matt Hickman: If there’s one thing I pride myself on, it’s practicing vigilance when it comes to making sure that I unplug any non-essential appliances and electronics when I’m not using them. As for the things that I don’t unplug on the regular, I ensure that they’re connected to a vampire energy-combating power strip or similar (prefably non-terrifying) devices. What can I say? I like to save moola.

However, in addition to the fridge, there are a couple of electronic devices in my home that I dare not tamper — highly essential items that I never turn off and leave plugged in 24/7: My modem and AirPort Extreme base station.

Having previously delved into the energy-guzzling nature of newfangled HD-DVR cable boxes (crazy enough, they suck more juice than Energy Star rated fridges), the Natural Resources Defense Council has now set its sights on modems and routers, devices, that like cable boxes, are ubiquitous and rarely unplugged. Collectively, Americans consume $1 billion worth of electricity per year on keeping home networking devices fired up but could potentially save a whopping $330 million in costs if they switch over to energy-efficient models.

In a just-released, first-of-its-kind report titled “Cutting Energy and Costs to Connect to the Internet: Improving the Efficiency of Home Network Equipment”  the NRDC’s crackerjack team of scientists in partnership with consulting firm Ecova examine exactly how much being constantly connected at home is costing us. For starters, standard modems, wireless routers, and similar devices consume just as much energy as a 32-inch flat-screen TV — that’s 30 times more than a phone charger. And there are approximately 145 million of them in use nationwide.

This all adds up to 8.3 billion kWH khours of electricity consumed each year, the equivalent of the output of three large, coal-burning power plants (500 MW). The result, according to the NRDC,  “is an estimated 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year, equivalent to the pollution spewing from the tailpipes of 1.1 million vehicles.”

Explains NRDC senior scientist Noah Horowitz in a press release: These small, innocuous black boxes that never sleep consume enough electricity each year to power all 1.2 million homes in the Silicon Valley area, the hi-tech capital of the world. Small network devices suck roughly the same amount of energy around the clock, whether or not you are sending or receiving any data. But there are steps that manufacturers can – and should – take to make sure these devices are no longer energy vampires. The thing is, hardly any manufacturers are currently stepping up to the plate to address the inherently energy-draining nature of home networking devices. Energy efficient options do exist — and they’re 25 percent more energy efficient, resulting in the aforementioned $330 million in saved energy costs  —but are somewhat of a rarity. “The manufacturers know how to build the better mousetrap, and it’s time for that innovation to be a standard feature in the new modems and routers we buy at the store or receive from our Internet providers,” says Horowitz. The mostly good news is that Energy Star is on the case: The government’s ENERGY STAR® program is expected to soon issue a specification that will result in a label to help customers buy efficient models and choose Internet providers offering energy-saving network equipment in their subscription packages. However, qualifying models will not be required to meet the industry’s advanced benchmarks to scale power down when data is not being transmitted. In addition, the state of California is considering setting minimum energy efficiency standards to make sure every model sold there is an efficient one. All rather sobering stuff but good to hear progress is being made.

"MyFitnessPal Security Breach Affects 150 Million Users, Under Armour Reports","Hackers breached MyFitnessPal, a popular calorie-counting app and website, and acquired private data from about 150 million users. Under Armour Inc., which owns the nutritional app, announced Thursday that an “unauthorized party” gained access to the data in late February. Information acquired by the hackers included user names, email addresses and hashed passwords, the company said. Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers were not affected since the app doesn’t collect that information. Payment card information was also unaffected because the company collects and processes that information separately.  The company says it does not know the identity of the party responsible for the security breach. MyFitnessPal allows users to track their daily meals, count how many calories they consume and search for the nutritional information of specific foods. In a notice to the app’s users, Under Armour Chief Digital Officer Paul Fipps said the company learned of the breach on Sunday. The company alerted its users four days later. “We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation,” Fipps wrote. “We have also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement authorities.” The company is urging MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords immediately.  Under Armour is the latest victim of a string of security breaches affecting companies in all industries. Orbitz, a travel booking site, announced this month that it had a security breach that affected about 880,000 payment cards from the site’s users. Equifax also announced this month that it had another massive data breach affecting 2.4 million customers in 2017, six months after it revealed a previous breach that affected 143 million additional people.

This Jobs Program Just Might Get People Back To Work,"By Sophie Quinton   BALTIMORE — When the man in the teal hoodie mentioned that he had trained as a pharmacy technician, Lachelle Hill’s voice rose in excitement. “Why don’t I see that on here?” the state job counselor asked, pointing at the paperwork on the table between them. Hill was counseling Corey, a 30-year-old jobseeker who didn’t share his last name, at a federally funded job center here on the top floor of a shopping mall, an escalator ride away from a Forever 21 and a Cinnabon. Unemployment insurance beneficiaries are required to look for work, but Hill wasn’t just checking Corey’s paperwork for compliance. She was helping him focus his job search, and trying to steer him toward positions he was qualified for. Such conversations are central to a reemployment grant program that the U.S. Department of Labor has touted for years. In February, Congress passed a budget bill that would make the program permanent and increase its funding from about $100 million last year to more than $3 billion over the next six years. To push states to improve their programs further, the law requires that starting in 2023 states must spend a quarter of their money on “evidence-based interventions” that have been proven to get people jobs faster. But creating evidence-based employment programs can be tricky. While research generally shows that employment assistance helps people get jobs, it’s not always clear why certain programs work well and whether they can be expanded. The nationwide employment program that Corey’s benefiting from is based on a Nevada model that significantly reduced the amount of time people received unemployment benefits. Studies have yet to determine whether the Nevada approach can get the same results elsewhere. State workforce and unemployment insurance officials are now waiting for the Labor Department to clarify its definition of “evidence-based.” “We’re all waiting on pins and needles,” said Michelle Meader, who operates Washington state’s version of the employment program. Back at the job center, Corey said he’d been looking for jobs on roadwork crews and at the seaport, and talking to a friend about starting a day labor business. Hill zeroed in on the brightest spot on his resume: his pharmacy training, which could net him wages of about $15 an hour in the area. “Sometimes, people crash because they aim too low,” Hill said. Corey explained that his pharmacy technician license had expired, but Hill didn’t bat an eye. “Let’s look into the recertification, and see if we can get you the funds to do that.”   Success in Nevada The current federal reemployment program began as a grant with a slightly different focus called Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment, or REA. The first $18 million was split between 20 states in 2005. States used the money to require some unemployment insurance claimants to go to a career center for an interview. Staff members would check that the claimant was actively searching for work, share labor market information, and make sure they had a job search plan. The program was designed to uncover idlers who weren’t looking for work — and thus weren’t eligible for benefits — and to help participants get jobs faster. A 2011 Labor Department-funded study of the REA program in Florida, Idaho, Illinois and Nevada found that, on average, participants reduced their time receiving benefits by over a week compared with a control group. The Nevada program had the best results: It cut time receiving benefits by almost three weeks, saving $805 in payments on average. For every dollar spent on administering the program four were saved on unemployment benefits, according to the study conducted by IMPAQ International, a research and evaluation firm in Bethesda, Maryland. The researchers said Nevada’s program may have been successful because it used the same staff to conduct eligibility checks, help claimants make job search plans, and also — thanks to a separate federal grant — connected participants with more career services. Claimants felt like the job counselors were there to help them, not put them through a compliance exercise, said Lynda Parven, deputy administrator of the Employment Security Division at the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. “Most people saw it not as a stick, but as a carrot.” The Labor Department restructured the grant requirements in 2015 to reflect Nevada’s model. The program now emphasizes job assistance targeted to a claimant’s needs and requires staff to refer participants to at least one other career service, such as a resume workshop at a job center. The employment program is now active in almost every state. But while the prior version of the grant required states to randomly select participants, the current version selects participants from higher-need populations, such as discharged veterans and people likely to struggle to find a job. States use algorithms to determine who falls into the latter group. But Can It Be Repeated? The Labor Department has long held up the Nevada results as a success story. In last year’s budget request, for instance, the agency called the reemployment program “a proven activity that saves an average of $536 per claimant.” The figure is seemingly taken from a 2012 study of the Nevada REA program, also by IMPAQ International. But researchers still are not sure what caused Nevada’s program to work so well, if it can be replicated, or if the current version of the program delivers the same results. The lack of clarity is true of many programs that help get people back to work. “A lot of the evidence on these interventions has been kind of at a black box level,” said Yvette Chocolaad, policy director for the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, at a recent Urban Institute event. While the overall outcome may be good, it may not be clear what components of a program make a difference. Employment programs involve many factors. While research highlights a few strategies that work, such as friendly emails and follow-up messages that encourage claimants to come to their appointment at a job center, others are hard to quantify or replicate, such as a program’s leadership.   Jacob Klerman, principal associate of Abt Associates, an evaluation company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is wrapping up a Labor Department study that compares REA programs in multiple states. He wouldn’t remark on the yet-to-be-published findings, but said it wasn’t clear if the Nevada model could be copied. “The results from Nevada are basically twice as large as any other state. So Nevada is an outlier.” As for the current version of the reemployment program, it’s too new to have been subjected to rigorous academic studies. Many state agencies are still crunching the first year of data on, for instance, whether the new model has decreased the amount of time people spend receiving benefits. Maryland’s data so far, collected by the unemployment insurance office, shows that last year over 18,000 people attended a job services orientation, and almost half as many made it to a follow-up session, such as a resume workshop. The program’s most important element may be the staff. At the job center here in Baltimore, they are a friendly bunch, quick to hand out inspiration. On a recent Friday morning, a receptionist in the lemon-walled reception area urged on a young man with an aphorism: “You’re a go-getter. Good things come to those who wait, but better things come to those who go out and get it.” In a cubicle on the other side of the room, Hill deftly guided reemployment program participants toward services that might help their job search. She asked a recent college graduate laid off from a mortgage company if he was tailoring his resume to every job application, and she suggested he sign up for a resume workshop to get some tips. Then Hill sat down with a young woman with braces and a trendy bob who said she was eager to take any job at all. The woman had previously worked as a security guard and in customer service, and she seemed a little lost and unsure of herself. Hill took a firmer, more motherly approach, registering her for a career aptitude test and an interviewing workshop and encouraging her to come back later for more one-on-one counseling. Hill asked if the woman had access to a computer at home — she didn’t — and told her she was welcome to use the job center’s computers. In the next room, the program manager for the Maryland reemployment program, Kari Pompilli, was also interviewing claimants. “Our goal is to not let them fall into a rut of unemployment,” she said later. If jobseekers confer with someone who listens to them and is optimistic about their search — “That’s half the battle, for some people,” she said.    Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research ",POLITICS,BUSINESS

"Palo Verde Beetles, Huge Horny Bugs, Descend On Arizona Looking For Love (VIDEO)","Ah yes, the summer rains of the Southwest monsoon. Lightning strikes, microbursts. It's so romantic ... particularly if you're a 5-inch long palo verde beetle. Apparently people in Arizona are freaking out over large, cockroach-looking bugs that have arrived with the monsoon. Dustin Williams, owner of Green Mango Pest Control, told Arizona's KTVK that his phone has been ringing off the hook with questions and concerns about the fierce-looking longhorn beetles. ""People in Arizona are used to the scorpions, the little American roaches, but with the 4-inch palo verde they call and say, 'What the heck is going on?'"" Williams said in an interview with the station. (Story continues below)
Do I make you horny?  Longhorn palo verde beetles emerge to mate during Arizona's monsoon season. Photo: Imgur What's going on? More like 'Let's Get It On.' It just so happens that monsoon season is palo verde beetle mating season. The beastly buggers, which are among the largest beetles in North America, live underground for two-to-four years of their lives before emerging to mate when the weather changes. Liberated and looking to score, they fly -- yes, fly -- around looking for partners for about a month before they die. ""As soon as they mate, they die. I've seen about a month, maybe, is their lifespan after they come out of the ground,"" Williams told KTVK.  Bug blog Myrmecos notes that ""hundreds of thousands"" of palo verde beetles -- which derive their name from the plant whose roots they feed on as grubs -- surface in Tucson every June.  
Palo verde beetles look scary, but they're harmless. A puppy investigates. Photo: Imgur Apparently, Myrmecos author Alex Wild can track the arrival of the bugs by new comments that surface on a blog post he wrote about palo verdes in 2008. Although the beetles are harmless to humans, their sheer size does tend to freak people out: ""These things are tough! You can step on them with all your weight and it will only stun them. The best way I’ve found to exterminate them is by repeatedly smashing them with a brick, though it still only works about 3/4 of the time. It makes for a fun challenge though. I think my next attempt is going to be a flame thrower, maybe a lawnmower."" So much for live and let love.

Fox News Viewers Really Don’t Like Lifelong Republican Robert Mueller,"WASHINGTON ― Fox News viewers aren’t too keen on Robert Mueller, the longtime Republican law enforcement official now heading the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Of those Americans who say at least some of their information on the FBI’s investigation came from Fox News, 65 percent strongly disapproved of Mueller, while another 9 percent somewhat disapproved, a newly released HuffPost/YouGov survey finds.  Mueller got higher approval from those watching other networks, with 60 percent of those following the investigation on CNN saying they strongly approved and 70 percent of those getting news from MSNBC giving the special counsel strong approval. Some people followed the story on multiple networks. Most Fox News viewers ― 68 percent ― also thought that the FBI was biased against President Donald Trump, while 61 percent either had little or no trust in the FBI. (The kind of people who turn to Fox News, of course, are also probably likely to be the most suspicious of the probe to begin with: About half of the Trump voters who’ve been following the story say they’ve tuned into Fox.) More than three-quarters of Americans say they’ve heard at least something in the news lately about Mueller and the FBI’s Russia investigation ― and among that group, nearly half said at least some of their news came from cable TV.  Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity have been heavily criticizing the special counsel investigation along with Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who named Mueller as special counsel and is also a Republican. Mueller is a decorated veteran who joined the Justice Department under George H.W. Bush and was nominated as FBI director by George W. Bush. Overall, the HuffPost/YouGov survey found that Americans are largely split on the FBI’s handling of the Russia investigation, with 37 percent approving, 36 percent disapproving, and the rest unsure. Mueller gets only modestly more positive marks: 38 percent approve of his performance as special counsel, while 32 percent disapprove. Just under half of respondents say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, down significantly from 2015, although relatively unchanged from polls taken earlier this year. As in previous surveys, views are deeply polarized. About three-quarters of Hillary Clinton voters, but only a third of Trump voters, say they have even a fair amount of trust in the FBI. A 73 percent majority of Trump voters, but just 7 percent of Clinton voters, think the agency is biased against the president. A previous HuffPost/YouGov poll showed that Trump had successfully convinced most of his voters that the FBI was biased against him. On Sunday, Trump called for an investigation into whether the FBI infiltrated his campaign by having an informant interview three associates of the campaign. Over the weekend, he also called on “real Americans” to “start getting tough” on the investigation he called a “scam.” Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 10-12 among U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

International Health Group Drops Partnership With Heineken Over 'Beer Girls',"An international health organization has suspended its partnership with the Heineken beer company because of the controversial use of so-called “beer girls” to promote its products. The Global Fund launched a partnership in January with the Dutch brewer in its latest campaign to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Heineken was to use its communications and logistics expertise to help shape effective messages, identify demand and provide quality control in shipments of medical supplies, according to a Heineken statement. But the Global Fund announced on Thursday in a statement that it was suspending its partnership with Heineken “based on recent reports of the company’s use of female beer promoters in ways that expose them to sexual exploitation and health risks,” National Public Radio reported. “We take these allegations very seriously and have challenged Heineken to examine their operations and make changes to protect women from sexual exploitation and health risks,” said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands. “We are suspending the partnership until such time as Heineken can take appropriate action to address these issues.” The mostly young drink promoters are paid low wages — and work for tips, largely from groups of intoxicated men — to push certain beers in bars. Heineken has come under particular pressure to end the practice in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. A 2011 study found that some Heineken beer girls in Cambodian bars moonlighted as sex workers for extra money and faced increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Reporter Olivier van Beemen revealed a similar situation in West African bars in an article in the Dutch publication NRC last week. That was apparently what Sands was referencing when he said “recent reports.” Heineken could not immediately be reached for comment. The company, however, responded to van Beemen’s article, saying it took drink promoters’ risk of sexual exploitation very seriously.  “The practices described go completely against what we stand for as a company, and therefore we strongly condemn these malpractices,” said the Heineken statement. “The beer promoters are not employed by Heineken, but are sourced via external agencies ... this makes it difficult to properly supervise the working conditions. However, we simply cannot allow them to continue to be confronted with unwanted intimacies and abuse or even with prostitution during their work.” The company’s statement concluded: “We will take further steps together with our local operating companies, promotional agencies and other relevant parties to deal with these malpractices and prevent them in the future.” Critics had earlier condemned Global Fund’s partnership with Heineken, saying an organization concerned with health should not work with a company pushing alcohol, which can be detrimental to health. It’s been a bad month for Heineken. Earlier this week, the company yanked a beer commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as “terribly racist.” The Heineken Light ad showed a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past several black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline, “Sometimes, lighter is better,” flashed on the screen. “We missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,” a Heineken spokesperson told Newsweek. The Global Fund is an international organization headquartered in Geneva that’s the largest funder of programs to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided seed money for the organization that began in 2002, according to Agence France Presse.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
How Being An Immigrant Helped Me Become A Better CEO,"America is known as a land of not just opportunity, but also as a center of entrepreneurial innovation and a magnet for talent from all over the world. Personally, my experience as an immigrant set me up for entrepreneurial success.  My backstory: I immigrated to America from my native Bulgaria as a young college student. After graduating, I worked for five years as an engineer at Google before founding a successful venture-backed technology company, Leanplum. There are five life skills I learned from immigrating to the US that shaped me into a better CEO. Whether or not you share this experience, these skills may help you found and grow your company as well.  1. Take Risks  Immigrating is the ultimate risk. Most people can’t imagine a scarier move than leaving their home country to live in foreign land with a different language, where traditional social networks and safety nets are absent.  I moved to America in 2003 to attend college in New York. I was 19. My entire worldly belongings fit into two suitcases, and I had borrowed thousands of dollars from my family to help pay for college. But even though this was a massive risk for me and my family, it was worth it because it enabled me to pursue opportunities that I never could have achieved in my home country.  In a way, being an immigrant prepared me for the risks and stresses of running a startup. Compared to the emotional commitment of asking your friends and family to help fund your education, pitching VC investors is easy!  2. Be Resourceful  Immigrating to the US forced me to become more resourceful. Out of necessity, I constantly had to adapt, solve problems, figure things out, and generally learn how to survive and thrive in a new country.  In the same way, entrepreneurs learn every day by putting out fires, finding new solutions, and pivoting away from failure. Being an entrepreneur requires continuously adapting and taking on a mindset of 24x7 learning. At the same time, you must find new ways to solve problems and serve in every role imaginable, from CTO to CFO to customer service rep.  The best entrepreneurs, like immigrants, are relentlessly self-reliant — they proactively shape circumstances to suit their goals.  3. Believe in Your Vision  When I first arrived in the US, I learned the radical lesson of mental de-cluttering. While in college, I worked 20 hours per week in the cafeteria during the graveyard shift, the maximum time allowed to work on campus as a full-time student, all while triple majoring in math, computer science, and computational science. I only had time for working, studying, eating, and sleeping. I didn’t overthink my situation — just did what I had to do to succeed. This is the same mentality as entrepreneurship.  When I started Leanplum, I was in the same mentality as when I was 19 — non-stop coding, talking to customers, eating, and sleeping. Starting and scaling Leanplum has been one of the happiest and most thrilling adventures of my life, because it has given me the chance to pursue a specific vision for what I wanted to achieve, with focus, determination, and a great team.  4. Move Between Cultures  I’ve been privileged to understand and appreciate multiple cultures, finding ways to operate effectively across cultural boundaries. Being an immigrant has made me a better person, as well as a better entrepreneur.  Even if you never move to a new country, learning another language, working with a diverse team, and respecting unique cultural differences can help improve your sense of empathy, enhance your tolerance of ambiguity, and help you understand other people’s intentions. Being an immigrant has helped me relate to people better and given me greater confidence in working with individuals from all walks of life.  5. See Things Differently  Perhaps the greatest life skill I’ve learned from immigrating is a sense of perspective. There seems to be something about the experience of being an immigrant that makes people have a broader perspective and embrace innovative ideas. Many of America’s most innovative entrepreneurs have this “immigrant” mindset. Steve Jobs was the son of an immigrant. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, are also immigrants. Immigrants have started more than half of America’s billion-dollar startup companies.    America must not lose this incredibly valuable competitive advantage. We must continue to be a welcoming place for immigrants, especially for the entrepreneurial immigrants who invest so much to start new businesses, create new jobs, launch whole new industries, and transform our sense of possibility of what life can be like.

Uber's Self-Driving Program At Risk As Judge Considers Heated Case Brought By Rival,"A federal judge heard arguments Wednesday in a case that could put Uber’s self-driving car development on hiatus, based on claims from rival Waymo that Uber stole some of its trade secrets. Waymo, a Google-spinoff, is seeking an injunction against Uber’s program, effectively halting it for the duration of the trial. Self-driving vehicles are central to Uber’s long-term business strategy, so halting work on them could have severe financial repercussions for the company. At the heart of the case is a technology called LiDAR that helps an autonomous vehicle map out and navigate its surroundings as it’s driving. Waymo lawyers presented evidence that a former executive named Anthony Levandowski downloaded Waymo’s LiDAR designs, along with some 14,000 other documents, before he left the company in January 2016. Soon after Levandowski left, he started a competitor company named “Otto” that was purchased by Uber for $680 million less than a year later. Waymo lawyer Charles Verhoeven portrayed Otto as little more than a shell company, founded by Levandowski for no other purpose than selling valuable, confidential technology to Uber. And while U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup conceded, speaking of Waymo’s evidence, that he’s “never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” ultimately the company struggled to prove that Uber asked Levandowski to steal Waymo’s files on Uber’s behalf. That matters, since Waymo is suing Uber ― not Levandowski. “I’m listening very carefully to see the proof that shows that Uber was aware that he downloaded information,” Alsup told Charles Verhoeven. “That would be pretty damning if you had that.” Verhoeven maintained that proof does exist, but it’s among 3,500 or so documents, which Uber says contain confidential information that it refused to release. Complicating matters, Levandowski has asserted his fifth amendment rights and refused to testify. (He also stepped away from Uber’s LiDAR-related research for the duration of the case). In lieu of the “smoking gun” Alsup sought, Verhoeven presented evidence claiming Levandowski conspired with Uber before he left Waymo. “There was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Levandowski had a deal,” he said. That evidence includes emails Levandowski exchanged with Uber while he still worked at Waymo, and 5.3 million shares of stock (worth approximately $250 million) Uber granted Levandowski on Jan. 28, 2016, the day after he left Google. Uber responded by clarifying it actually awarded Levandowski the stock months later during the Otto acquisition, but set the vesting date earlier as a courtesy. Uber, represented by outside lawyer Arturo Gonzalez, denied any wrongdoing, as it always has. “We are adamant that we did not use any of their secrets,” he said. Notably, however, Uber also hasn’t gone out of its way to defend Levandowski. Gonzalez said Uber “didn’t have any basis” to dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files. While it’s conceivable he brought them into work on a personal laptop and consulted them, Gonzalez said, “There’s no evidence that it happened.” Uber’s ultimate goal is to move the case out of the public spotlight and into arbitration, where this could all be settled privately. The judge is expected to make a decision on the injunction sometime in the next couple weeks. A trial ― should it come to that ― would likely begin sometime in October.",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Cassini Preps For Death Plunge Into Saturn And Sends Farewell Image Of Tiny Earth,"As NASA’s amazing Cassini spacecraft takes on technological death-defying feats months before it goes into a final plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere, it continues to transmit images back to Earth of things never seen before so close to a giant planet. This week, Cassini flew through the relatively short 1,500-mile gap that separates Saturn’s enormously intricate ring system from the top of the planet’s atmosphere, transmitting precious data back to Earthbound scientists. Cassini also this month beamed home ― through Saturn’s icy rings ― a unique image of Earth, 870 million miles away, as seen above. That very tiny dot in space represents everything we are, our continents and oceans ― everything about where we are in the cosmos. And if you need to strain your eyes to see both Earth and our moon, here’s a zoomed-in version of us with the moon to our left:  It offers an interesting perspective on our place in our little neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy. And while this is the most recent photograph of Earth from very far away, it’s not the first and not necessarily the most dramatic. We’ve gathered some incredible images here to show how, from someone else’s perspective ― if they happen to live on a world that isn’t part of our solar system and if their technology discovered us in the cosmos ― they could easily refer to Earth as, well, an exoplanet. From the following pictures, it’s not easy to tell how many billions of people live here, or to be able to make out any actual signs of technology. We are just one dot, among billions and billions (probably trillions) of other dots. Maybe someone out there is looking in our direction and wondering if there’s any life on this exoplanet dot known locally as Earth. ",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
"Consciousness Works Differently Than You Think, According To This New Theory","We may not be nearly as aware of the world around us as we'd like to think, according to a thought-provoking new theory in cognitive neuroscience.  Just like a movie appears continuous even though it's made up of a series of separate images, our brains might use a two-stage model of visual processing to perceive the world in short blips, or ""time slices."" The brain may then piece the individual frames together into an unbroken image of the world, the new ""time slice theory"" suggests. ""We intuitively believe that we are directly aware of things at any moment in time,"" Dr. Frank Scharnowski, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Zurich and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post on Friday. ""This is not the case."" In a paper published Tuesday in the journal PLoS Biology, an international team of researchers suggests that there's some lag time between when we actually see something and when we become aware of it. Data from previously published psychological and behavioral experiments supports this theory, the researchers determined. The two-stage model they devised suggests that our brains first process visual information from the environment while we're in an unconscious state, and then transfer it to our conscious awareness.  Here's what the researchers believe happens: First, we rapidly and unconsciously process visual information, which takes only several milliseconds. Then, the features of that visual information are integrated into our conscious awareness in a coherent way, which takes several hundred milliseconds. This would mean that consciousness comes in a series of 400-millisecond ""time slices,"" with gaps of unconsciousness in between. Got that? ""We do not experience stimuli and objects during their actual presentation, but much later when they are rendered conscious,"" Scharnowski said. ""Such a representation is akin to the answer to the question of how were your holidays: 'We enjoyed the colors of the Tuscan landscape for three days, and then went to Venice for four sunny days at the sea.' The response is a compressed post-hoc description regarding the temporal features of the trip even though the actual event was spread over a long period of time."" So how much faster is human vision than perception? Much faster.  ""We can see the time difference when two bars are presented with a delay of 3 milliseconds,"" Scharnowski said. ""In contrast, conscious perception is much slower and can be delayed for several hundred milliseconds."" This time lag is a good thing for perception, according to study co-author Dr. Michael Herzog, a professor at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne's Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland. ""The brain wants to give you the best, clearest information it can, and this demands a substantial amount of time,"" he said in a statement. ""There is no advantage in making you aware of its unconscious processing, because that would be immensely confusing.” If we don't see the world as a continuous flow and instead process it more like a string of snapshots, human consciousness may not be as coherent as we'd like to think.  ""Although this is counterintuitive, it is nothing scary,"" Scharnowski said. ""We also perceive the letters of this text as continuous even though they are of discrete pixels.""",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
Famed Quarterback Warren Moon Hit With Sexual Harassment Lawsuit,"Former NFL star Warren Moon was sued for sexual harassment and sexual battery by an assistant in California who says the hall of fame quarterback made inappropriate work demands, including forcing her to share his bed on business trips. The lawsuit, which was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court and first reported on by The Washington Post, says that Moon, 61, grabbed Wendy Haskell’s crotch while she was sleeping during a trip to Seattle. Haskell, 32, who was hired at Moon’s Sports 1 Marketing agency in July, also accuses Moon of drugging her during a trip to Mexico in October and then pulling off her bathing suit. Haskell claims she was demoted from her executive assistant role after she complained about Moon’s unwanted sexual advances. Moon’s lawyer Daniel Fears released a statement on behalf of his client: “Warren Moon has yet to be served with the lawsuit filed by Wendy Haskell, but he is aware of the claims contained in it. Mr. Moon denies the claims by Ms. Haskell. Mr. Moon contends these claims are meritless, and he has every intention to vigorously defend himself in court.” According to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by Deadspin, Haskell accuses Moon of having a “dark and twisted side.” She says Moon forced her to submit to a number of perverse arrangements, including “providing him unfettered access to the bathroom every time she showered, wearing skimpy lingerie while in the obligatory single room, obtaining prior approval for her wardrobe, and being subjected to continuous unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances.” Haskell filed her lawsuit the same week that Time magazine named “The Silence Breakers” as its 2017 Person of the Year. The cover image includes Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, who have all spoken out against various forms of sexual misconduct in the past year. The cover also includes the arm of a woman whose face viewers cannot see. Her presence is meant to represent all the women and men who fear coming forward with their own stories.  Haskell, through her attorney, told the Post that she wanted her name to be made public, though she did not make any additional comment on the lawsuit. Moon requested a leave of absence from his role as an analyst for the Seattle Seahawks’ radio broadcast. According to ESPN, Moon was in the midst of his 14th season as a Seahawks analyst. This article has been updated with a statement by Moon’s lawyer.",SPORTS,SPORTS
Desiree Linden Becomes First American Woman To Win Boston Marathon In 33 Years,"Two-time Olympian Desiree Linden became the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in 33 years on Monday when she broke the tape at the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 39 minutes, 54 seconds. Linden, 34, won with a time more than 14 minutes slower than her previous two races, but course conditions were not conducive to personal- or course-record performances. Fellow American Sarah Sellers was second, 4:10 behind Linden. “I don’t have the right words. I’m thrilled,” Linden said on the TV broadcast immediately after the race. “It’s supposed to be hard. ... I was just lucky to get it done.” Linden finished second in 2011 with a time of 2:22:38. No words. Just pure emotion from @des_linden. #BostonMarathon pic.twitter.com/lY4Ldn3MYA In the men’s 26.2-mile race, Japanese amateur Yuki Kawauchi won in 2:15:58, his first major marathon victory. Kawauchi is known in the running community but works full time for the government in Japan and is without sponsorship. He is not regularly viewed as an “elite” marathon runner. Kawauchi, 31, appeared stunned and emotional at the finish line. While he is a seasoned runner with more than 80 marathon finishes in his career, Monday’s time in Boston adds to his record number of 2:20-and-under marathon finishes. The temperature Monday morning at the start line was announced at 30 degrees and rain fell throughout the race, often heavily, to make for a slower overall pace. “For me, these are the best conditions possible,” Kawauchi said after the race. The last Japanese man to win the Boston Marathon was Toshihiko Seko in 1987. Kawauchi is the ninth Japanese male to win Boston. Kawauchi is dubbed a “Citizen Runner” and holds the world record for the fastest marathon in a full business suit and the top time wearing a panda costume.",SPORTS,SPORTS

Google Launches Effort To Remove Terrorist And Extremist Content From YouTube,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google will implement more measures to identify and remove terrorist or violent extremist content on its video-sharing platform YouTube, the company said in a blog post on Sunday. Google said it would take a tougher position on videos containing supremacist or inflammatory religious content by issuing a warning and not monetizing or recommending them for user endorsements, even if they do not clearly violate its policies. The company will also employ more engineering resources and increase its use of technology to help identify extremist videos, in addition to training new content classifiers to quickly identify and remove such content. “While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies, the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now,” said Google’s general counsel Kent Walker.  Google will expand its collaboration with counter-extremist groups to identify content that may be used to radicalize and recruit extremists, it said. The company will also reach potential Islamic State recruits through targeted online advertising and redirect them towards anti-terrorist videos in a bid to change their minds about joining. Germany, France and Britain, countries where civilians have been killed and wounded in bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in recent years, have pressed Facebook <FB.O> and other providers of social media such as Google and Twitter <TWTR.N> to do more to remove militant content and hate speech. Facebook on Thursday offered additional insight on its efforts to remove terrorism content, a response to political pressure in Europe to militant groups using the social network for propaganda and recruiting. Facebook has ramped up use of artificial intelligence such as image matching and language understanding to identify and remove content quickly, the company said in a blog post.",TECH,TECH
"Billions Of Cicadas Are About To Rise From The Earth, Have Sex And Die","Hope you like the sound of humming. That is, if you live in the Northeastern United States, anyway. Billions of cicadas are slated to rise up from the ground in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio to mate next month, The Washington Post reports. They have been lying in wait since they began life in 1999. This summer, at age 17, they’ll finally be crawling above ground to make the lives of human beings a living hell, just like any good teens. Then, the winged insects will mate and die off in around a month. These “17-year-cicadas” include three different species, according to Discovery News. Other types are on a one-year or 13-year schedule. This year’s cicada crop will emerge as nymphs once nighttime soil temperatures eight-inches below the surface hit 64 degrees for four days in a row, according to The Plain Dealer. The nymphs climb into trees, then shed their exoskeletons to emerge as red-eyed adults, ready to breed. Cicadas eat tree sap and typically don’t damage plants significantly. They also don’t bite or sting. But what some folks dread is the incessant noise. Sure, that doesn’t sound so bad, but when hordes of the insects are all buzzing at once, it’s a little weird. “It feels like an alien spaceship coming in,” Gene Miller, a resident of Arlington, Virginia, told The Washington Post in 2004.

The Georgia GOP Governor's Primary Focuses On Guns And Immigration,"WASHINGTON ― The race for Georgia’s Republican gubernatorial nomination is all about the culture war.  The three leading candidates have aired ads showing themselves wielding rifles and handguns. One declared he owned a “big truck” just in case he needed to round up criminal illegals and “take them home myself.” Not to be topped, another started a statewide tour with a “deportation bus.”  The attention-grabbing ads and stunts have highlighted a seven-candidate race in which, should none get more than 50 percent of the vote in Tuesday’s primary, the top two finishers will advance to a late July runoff.  The frontrunners are Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp.   In one of Kemp’s ads, he holds a shotgun while “interviewing” a young man interested in dating one of his daughters. The requirements for wooing that daughter? “Respect and a healthy appreciation for the 2nd Amendment,” the suitor replies. The uproar generated by the ad could help Kemp stand out in a field that includes former state Sen. Hunter Hill, state Sen. Michael Williams and former Navy SEAL and businessman Clay Tippins. Cagle also holds a gun in one of his spots, as a narrator brags about his endorsement by the National Rifle Association. The NRA’s backing came after he pushed an amendment to kill a tax break benefiting Georgia-based Delta following the company’s decision ― in reaction to February’s mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida ― to end a discount program for NRA members flying to the group’s national convention. (Never mind that the discount program was rarely used.)  In another ad, Cagle brags about his work to end so-called sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants in the state.  Hill, who has the endorsement of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), released an ad where he shoots a target and argues the age requirement to buy a handgun should be lowered to 18 from 21. “As governor, I won’t give an inch on our 2nd Amendment,” he says in the ad.  But those ads were just a set-up for the biggest free media play in the race: Williams’ deportation bus, which he drove around the state, promising “to fill this bus with illegals and send them back to where they came from. He would do so by implementing a program that allows state and local police to enforce immigration law under a partnership with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. It worked. Williams received attention from local and national media, even landing an interview with Fox News ― a prize for any candidate in a competitive GOP primary. (Williams also received plenty of mockery when the bus briefly broke down.) The winner of the GOP primary will face one of the two Democrats, both former state representatives, in November: Stacey Abrams or Stacey Evans.  The showdown between journalist and activist Laura Moser and lawyer Lizzie Fletcher has become much bigger than a normal race for a House district nomination. The decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to attack Moser as unelectable turned the contest into a symbol of a broader battle between progressive candidates and the national party apparatus. That drove donations to Moser, helping to lift her over other candidates in the March primary and into a runoff against Fletcher, who has the backing of EMILY’s List. The runoff campaign between the two fizzled somewhat ― The Texas Tribune labeled the contest “boring,” and the progressive energy and money animating Moser’s insurgency appears to have dried up.  The winner of the race will face Rep. John Culberson in a 7th Congressional District centered around west Houston. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the district by fewer than 2 percentage points in 2016. If Moser does pull off a win in the runoff, the race will become an instant test of whether progressives can win despite Democratic establishment doubts.  The Club for Growth, which views itself as the enforcer of GOP orthodoxy on free-market economics, has had an up-and-down few years. Its attacks on Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primaries were unable to stop his march to victory. Still, they ended up loving his tax cuts ― while hating his proposals to enact tariffs and restrict free trade.  The group sees a slew of open House seats in heavily Republican territory in Texas as a chance to reassert its influence. Club for Growth Action, the group’s political arm, has aired TV ads in four different districts in the run-up to Tuesday’s GOP runoffs. The group backs Michael Cloud (who’s also been endorsed by former Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul) in the 27th District, former Cruz chief of staff Chip Roy in the 21st, local official Ron Wright in the 6th, and GOP activist Bunni Pounds to replace Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling in the 5th.  Pounds, Cloud, Roy and Wright are all expected to join the House Freedom Caucus if elected to Congress.  The special election last year to replace then-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Congress turned into the most expensive House race in the nation’s history, with over $40 million spent on TV and radio advertising alone. In the end, Republican Karen Handel triumphed over Democrat Jon Ossoff in an early test of Democratic resistance to Trump. The Democratic primary to challenge Handel this year has been sleepier, to say the least. Former TV news anchor Bobby Kaple has raised the most money in the field, and earned the endorsement of former Gov. Roy Barnes and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Kevin Abel, a businessman, also amassed a significant war chest. But the late entrance of Lucy McBath, a former Delta flight attendant who became a gun control activist following the shooting death of her son, could shake up the contest. McBath only entered the contest following the massacre in Parkland, but has the backing of EMILY’s List. Also supporting her is Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg-backed group where McBath previously worked. The group has spent more than $500,000 on TV ads supporting her. ",POLITICS,POLITICS
"Pollutants Found In Children's Clothing From Multiple Luxury Fashion Brands, Greenpeace Says","BERLIN, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Environmental campaign group  Greenpeace has found traces of chemicals that can pollute  waterways in children's clothing and shoes made by luxury  brands, challenging the sector's reputation for higher standards  than those of mass fashion. In a report issued on Monday just before Milan Fashion Week,  Greenpeace said it found the substances in products from Dolce &  Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Hermes, Christian  Dior, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs. Greenpeace has been campaigning against pollutants used in  the textile industry since 2011. It wants major brands and their  suppliers to commit to stop discharging potentially harmful  chemicals in waste water by 2020. Concerned about toxicity to aquatic organisms and the fact  some do not biodegrade easily, the European Union has restricted  the industrial use of some of these chemicals but there are no  rules on the sales of textiles containing their residues. Greenpeace said 12 of the 27 articles it tested contained  residues of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), used in textile  manufacturing which it said can break down into  hormone-disrupting chemicals when released from garments during  washing. In five items, the group said it also found per- and  polyfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) used to make garments water  repellent. Five articles tested positive for phthalates, used in  printing designs on clothing, and three for antimony, a compound  used to manufacture polyester. The chemicals Greenpeace tested for have been commonly used  in textile manufacturing, but are gradually being phased out by  some brands due to concern about their polluting impact. Reuters could not independently confirm Greenpeace's  findings, which two of the companies sought to play down. Armani said its products were ""absolutely safe for  consumers"" as it complied with international guidelines that  were more restrictive than EU environmental requirements. Armani said it has committed to abolish all chemicals which  could cause environmental damage to production sites by 2020 and  is in discussion on this with environmental groups. Louis Vuitton said all its products fully complied with  international environment and safety standards, including the  children's ballerina shoes and sneakers that Greenpeace tested  positive for PFCs. Louis Vuitton said both had lower  concentration levels than international rules required. However, Louis Vuitton said it shared Greenpeace's concerns  as it recognised ""the intrinsic hazardous properties"" of the  chemicals used in the industry and said it was working hard to  exceed current environmental standards. Hermes, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Dior and Marc Jacobs were  not immediately available to comment. An industry consultant privately criticized the Greenpeace  campaign, but declined to speak publicly. Some big brands have become highly sensitive to scrutiny of  their environmental standards as shoppers demand more  information about how products are made, with companies like H&M   and Adidas keen to portray themselves as  ""green"". They are among two of the 20 brands Greenpeace has already  persuaded to make the ""Detox"" pledge, helped by supporters  bombarding the firms via social media. The only luxury names to  sign up so far are Britain's Burberry and Italy's  Valentino. Greenpeace said many of the products in its study were  labelled as ""Made in Italy"", usually a by-word for quality, but  still contained similar chemical residues to garments made in  developing countries. ""It's time these luxury brands lived up to their reputation  as fashion trendsetters, and started leading the toxic-free  fashion revolution,"" said Chiara Campione, a campaigner for  Greenpeace Italy. Many clothing retailers have already agreed to make their  clothing PFC-free but some outdoor brands have said there are  currently no PFC-free technologies that would provide the same  lasting level of weather protection.

These Pups Rescued From Puerto Rico Are Part Of This Year's Puppy Bowl,"Sunday’s Puppy Bowl XIV will include two extra special canine athletes. Every year, the event, which involves a bunch of adorable puppies frolicking around, serves as Animal Planet’s counter-programming to the Super Bowl. All of the participating dogs come from animal shelters or rescue groups, and this year, two of the puppies are animals rescued from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Kaleb Jr. and Archer, both mixed-breeds, were transported to the U.S. mainland by The Sato Project, a nonprofit focused on helping Puerto Rico’s stray dogs, ABC News reports. The Sato Project has sent puppies to the Puppy Bowl for the past seven years, according to Bustle, but this year its participation takes on a new significance as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the hurricane. As of Wednesday, nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority customers still had no power. “We’re hoping these little dogs on Sunday are going to fly the flag high and proud and people will once again start to realize that the crisis isn’t over there and we are a part of the USA,” Sato Project founder Chrissy Beckles told ABC 7. Kaleb Jr. and Archer have already been adopted by families in New York state, and both have been given new names — Murphy and Maddox, respectively, AM New York reports. They’re still called Kaleb Jr. and Archer in Puppy Bowl XIV promotional materials, though, so those are likely the names that will be used when the program airs. Both pups now appear to have great lives and loving homes, according to what their families told AM New York. Maddox, aka Archer, is a “super loving” puppy who enjoys belly rubs. And Murphy, aka Kaleb Jr., is a friendly, sociable dog whose hobbies include trying to sneak bites of steak and chasing a cat named Milton. The Sato Project still has other dogs available for adoption, though. The group is also accepting applications for temporary dog foster homes as well as for volunteers in both New York and Puerto Rico.",SPORTS,ENVIRONMENT
Animal Fathers: 12 Of The Best Non-Human Dads Out There (PHOTOS),"Some animal fathers out there give dads a bad rap. Polar bears aren't terribly cuddly with their young and have been known to eat them when food is scarce. Assassin bugs do the same thing (but is that really a surprise?). It's a rough life for many newborn non-humans, but there are some stellar dads in the animal kingdom. Emperor penguins stand watch over their eggs for two months in frigid antarctic blizzards. The giant water bug spends weeks walking around with dozens of eggs on its back. Male seahorses carry unborn eggs in a gestation pouch. There are a lot of superstar parents to look up to this father's day, so take a look at the slideshow below to see the extreme measures these animals will go to for their young. Here's to you, dads.",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Now We Know How 'Lucy' Died 3 Million Years Ago. Maybe.,"Cracking what must be one of the coldest cases of all time, scientists at the University of Texas claim to have figured out what killed “Lucy,” the iconic human ancestral specimen who lived and died more than 3 million years ago. In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature, the researchers argue that the pattern of fractures seen in Lucy’s 3.2-million-year-old fossilized bones show that she died as the result of a “vertical deceleration event.” In other words, a severe fall from a considerable height. Scientists have long debated whether Lucy, a small bipedal creature who belonged to an extinct species known as Australopithecus afarensis, spent time in trees (arborealism) as well as on the ground ― a point referenced by the paper’s lead author in a written statement. “It is ironic that the fossil at the center of a debate about the role of arborealism in human evolution likely died from injuries suffered from a fall out of a tree,” Dr. John Kappelman, a professor of anthropology and geological sciences at the university, said in the statement. For their research, Kappelman and and Dr. Richard Ketcham, a geological sciences professor at the university, used a CT scanner to create an archive of more than 35,000 “slices” of Lucy’s fossilized skeleton (which was found in Ethiopia in 1974 and whose name was inspired by the Beatles song “Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds,” according to the website of Arizona State University Institute of Human Origins). Subsequent analysis of the slices revealed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy’s right humerus (the long bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow) that the researchers maintain are similar to bone fractures seen in victims of falls. The researchers concluded that these and other fractures in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to brace herself ― but that the impact was too severe to have been survivable. The researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement. That sounds plausible, if a bit gruesome. But other scientists are skeptical. Dr. Rebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town in Africa, told The Washington Post that the study had failed to disprove alternative explanations for the breaks ― though she didn’t dismiss the research out of hand. “In my opinion this is a nice study that tells us something interesting about an individual who has played an important role — both scientifically and historically — in our understanding of human evolution,” she told the Post. But others were harsher in their appraisal of the new research. “There is a myriad of explanations for bone breakage,” Dr. Donald C. Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, told The Guardian. “The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a “just-so story” that is neither verifiable nor falsifiable, and therefore unprovable.” Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy’s fractures occurred long after she died, telling The New York Times that “elephant bones and hippo ribs appear to have the same kind of breakage. It’s unlikely they fell out of a tree.” But the new research focused on “a small subset of fractures” that are consistent with “high-energy bone-to-bone impacts” and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in fossilized bones, Kappelman told The Huffington Post in an email. “These appear to have occurred perimortem (at or near the time of death).” In any case, the fresh look at Lucy’s old bones seem to have humanized her ― at least for Kappelman. As he told HuffPost in the email: “Our hypothesis suggests that the fractures in Lucy’s shoulder were produced when she stretched out her arms in a last desperate attempt to break her fall.  We have all done this when we fall.  It was in the moment of understanding her death, of literally being able to experience what she went through, that I felt empathy for her. My understanding of her death brought her to life for me.”",SCIENCE,SCIENCE
So You Hired A Racist. Now What?,"There’s no doubt the election of Donald Trump by the electoral college emboldened white supremacists and provided them bigger platforms upon which to spread their anti-diversity messages. Racists no longer feel confined to trolling people on Twitter and are suddenly removing their white hoods and boldly showing their faces at KKK rallies. This puts businesses in a precarious situation: if you discover, online or otherwise, that one of your employees is racist — and actively engaged in promoting white supremacy — what should you do? Google recently fired James Damore shortly after he spent his working hours producing a 10 page anti-diversity manifesto in which he speculated that his women colleagues were biologically inferior to men. After the manifesto went viral, Google’s head of diversity Danielle Brown issued a statement acknowledging the manifesto, disputing its accuracy, and reaffirming Google’s commitment to diversity. Google CEO Sundar Pichai went out of his way to remind young girls in tech, “You belong in this industry. We need you.” And lastly, Damore was the unfortunate recipient of the dreaded pink slip, namely for violating Google’s code of conduct. Google did the right thing by sending a powerful message about their unwavering commitment to diversity and rejecting harmful gender stereotypes. Research shows time and time again that diversity isn’t just a nice-to-have, but a strategic imperative. Research by McKinsey tells us that 35 percent of ethnically diverse companies outperform their competitors, and diversity in the boardroom generates better and more profitable ideas. Still, there might be some white supremacists among our workplaces. If you’ve hired a racist, what should you do? Acknowledge that you’ve hired a racist. It can be very powerful to email your workforce acknowledging that, somewhere in the hiring process, you miscalculated a person’s cultural fit for your business. If one of your employees marched alongside the KKK in Charlottesville, let your workforce know. They probably already know, and your silence would simply ring volumes. In fact, Twitter user @YesYoureRacist identified several of the speakers and protestors at Charlotteville’s white nationalist rally. Revisit your code of conduct and ensure you’ve inserted strong pro-diversity language. Beyond being a moral imperative, diversity in our workplaces is a competitive advantage. Any employee caught to have violated your code of conduct has proven themselves unfit and unwilling to live up to the values upon which you want your business to be run. Resource your employee resource groups. ERGs are a great way for women, minorities, and allies to build community and proactively respond to current events. Put your money where your mouth is: Fund these ERGs to the best of your ability and empower them to make big impacts in your workplace. Assess job candidates for their “cultural fit.” Consider asking job candidates “What have you done to promote diversity and inclusion in your previous workplace?” This is a great way to weed out KKK recruits and to ensure you’re hiring folks who, like you, value D&I. Fire any employee who acts on their racial animus. If your employee marched with the KKK in Charlottesville, that could warrant their immediate dismissal from your workplace. Check with an employment attorney to see if you have grounds for firing, especially if they’ve violated your code of conduct or contributed to fostering a hostile work environment. Social media is a powerful community-building tool, but it also can be useful in exposing people. Sometimes, those people just so happen to be our students or employees who espouse Nazism. The values they harbor have no place in society, let alone our payroll. Cristina Lara managed diversity and inclusion at Hillary for America. She has previously worked in diversity & inclusion at Cisco and Amazon. Of course, her opinions are her own. Follow Cristina on Twitter.",BUSINESS,TECH
Establishment GOP Notches Win In Ohio Primary For Vacant House Seat,"State Sen. Troy Balderson narrowly defeated businesswoman Melanie Leneghan on Tuesday in the hotly contested Republican primary for Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, a battle that pitted the party’s two major wings against one another. Balderson beat out Leneghan as well as seven other GOP candidates, according to The Associated Press late Tuesday. He will face businessman Danny O’Connor, who defeated five other candidates to win the Democratic nomination for a special election scheduled for Aug. 7. Balderson was endorsed in the primary race by former Rep. Pat Tiberi, the Republican who represented the Columbus-area district before stepping down in January. Tiberi, a reliable ally of the House GOP leadership, spent nearly a half-million dollars from his old campaign account to boost Balderson, viewed by the party’s establishment as a more suitable candidate to retain the suburban district, given the difficult political environment for Republicans this year. Conservatives in Congress backed Leneghan, setting up the intraparty showdown. The House Freedom Caucus, led by co-founder Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), viewed her as the more solidly conservative candidate.  Last week, the group warned GOP leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), to stay out of the primary fight. The conservative anti-tax group Club for Growth also contributed $190,000 that paid for ads supporting Leneghan. Though the 12th district has traditionally been one the GOP could count on winning, the special election is expected to be competitive. And the winner of that race should have a leg up in the November vote for a full two-year term. Balderson and O’Connor also won the primaries to face off in the November elections for the seat. In 2016, President Donald Trump carried the district by slightly more than 11 percentage points ― a concerning margin for Republicans because of increased enthusiasm among Democrats that have marked recent special elections. In the March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, for example, Democrat Conor Lamb edged his GOP opponent in a district Trump carried by 20 percentage points. “We’re looking at a situation where every seat counts” to maintain the House GOP majority, Matt Borges, the former Ohio Republican Party chairman, told Politico last month. Terming Leneghan “out-of-step with mainstream Republicans,” he added that the party didn’t need “any self-inflicted wounds” in its fight to keep control of the House. ",POLITICS,POLITICS

"Exxon Mobil 'Misled' Public On Climate Change For 40 Years, Harvard Study Finds","Exxon Mobil Corp. deliberately deceived the public about the dangers of climate change for four decades, a new Harvard University study finds. For the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters Wednesday, two Harvard researchers analyzed nearly 200 documents related to Exxon Mobil’s climate change communications. The researchers found that America’s largest oil producer had repeatedly made “explicit factual misrepresentations” about global warming in advertisements aimed at the general public, while simultaneously acknowledging its risks behind closed doors.  “Our findings are clear: Exxon Mobil misled the public about the state of climate science and its implications,” study authors Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran wrote in a New York Times op-ed this week. “Available documents show a systematic, quantifiable discrepancy between what Exxon Mobil’s scientists and executives discussed about climate change in private and in academic circles, and what it presented to the general public.” The discrepancy, the researchers said, was staggering. About 80 percent of Exxon Mobil’s research and internal memos acknowledged that climate change was real and caused by humans. However, 80 percent of the company’s newspaper ads regarding climate change questioned this fact, the study found. An internal Exxon Mobil memo penned in 1979, for instance, acknowledged a possible link between fossil fuel combustion and an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Another memo from 1982 described “potentially catastrophic events” that could arise from climate change, such as the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. A peer-reviewed study conducted by Exxon Mobil scientists in the 1990s concluded  “the body of evidence ... now points towards a discernible human influence on global climate.” Another one from 2002 found that limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could be needed to “forestall coral reef bleaching, thermohaline circulation shutdown, and sea level rise.” But in 1997, the same year that the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, Exxon Mobil released an ad that called the science of climate change “too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” A 2000 Exxon Mobil advertorial in The New York Times described climate change as an “unsettled science.” The oil giant has previously defended itself by saying that it has never “suppressed climate change research.” But Oreskes and Supran said in their study that “the question is not whether Exxon Mobil ‘suppressed climate change research,’ but rather how they communicated about it.” Exxon Mobil’s peer-reviewed studies about climate change weren’t widely distributed or readily available to the general public, while their ads were meant to reach millions, the researchers noted. The company had “really good scientists,” Oreskes, a history of science professor, told the Times. “That finding then makes the contrast with the advertorials that much more notable.” The study comes as Exxon Mobil faces several lawsuits and investigations related to its transparency, or lack thereof, regarding climate science. Reacting to the Harvard study, Exxon Mobil called the research “inaccurate and preposterous.”   “Our statements have been consistent with our understanding of climate science,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement, according to Agence France-Presse news agency. Silvestri added that the researchers had “cherry-picked” data to “attack” Exxon Mobil’s reputation. Speaking to the Times, he highlighted two Exxon Mobil ads that had suggested that climate change “may pose” long-term risks. The scientists, however, rejected Silvestri’s claim. Supran told AFP that they’d “looked at the whole cherry tree” in their research, including the ads that the spokesman had mentioned. While Exxon Mobil did publish some ads that suggested potential risks associated with global warming, the “predominant stance taken [in the company’s climate change] advertorials is ‘Doubt,’” said the study, which was funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund.  Following the publication of the Harvard paper on Wednesday and the related op-ed, the hashtag #ExxonKnew began appearing on social media. The hashtag first gained popularity in 2015 after InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times published reports alleging that the oil had purposefully covered up what it knew about climate change. BREAKING: A new peer-reviewed study conclusively finds that Exxon misled public about climate science. https://t.co/hh1mK4uCM1 #ExxonKnew pic.twitter.com/LbpVC8jLuB Since then, numerous investigations at the state and federal level have been launched and lawsuits have been filed related to whether Exxon Mobil deceived the public or its investors about the risks posed by climate change, both to the environment and to its business.  Last month, three communities in California sued 37 oil, gas and coal companies including Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron for their alleged contributions to sea level rise and for concealing the hazards posed by global warming. The companies “have known for nearly a half century that unrestricted production and use of their fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes our climate,” the complaint reads. ″They have nevertheless engaged in a coordinated, multi-front effort to conceal and deny their own knowledge of those threats, discredit the growing body of publicly available scientific evidence, and persistently create doubt in the minds of customers, consumers, regulators, the media, journalists, teachers, and the public about the reality and consequences of the impacts of their fossil fuel pollution.” ",BUSINESS,BUSINESS
Trump's Plan On Prescription Drug Prices Looks Nothing Like What He Promised,"Candidate Donald Trump promised Americans a war on the pharmaceutical industry. President Donald Trump isn’t going to give them one. On Friday afternoon, the Department of Health and Human Services released a policy blueprint for helping Americans pay for prescription drugs that, with every passing year, get harder and harder to afford. “Today, my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people,” Trump said of the plan during a speech in the White House Rose Garden. Whether and how much the approach will ultimately reduce drug prices is unclear, and will probably remain so for some time. But while some of the ideas Trump endorsed have bipartisan support and the potential to help people, few experts expect the administration’s plan to have the kind of dramatic impact Trump once promised.  The health care industry certainly doesn’t seem scared. Stocks climbed following the speech, while analysts dismissed it loudly, using phrases like “non-event” and “waste of time.”  A missive from the health care trading desk at Jeffries said simply, “Jay-Z’s Blueprint far more impactful than HHS version.”  For those who think President Trump is taking on the drug companies, the industry and investors think otherwise --- shares are up. By a lot. pic.twitter.com/BXbssQm9JN Trump’s speech and a 39-page blueprint have been weeks in the making, although their roots lie in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump promoted himself as a different kind of Republican ― one who would stand up for average Americans and protect them from powerful corporate interests. The drug industry was high on the list of predators. He railed against them regularly, even after taking office, famously saying drugmakers were “getting away with murder” by charging such high prices for life-saving medications.  More controversially, Trump also endorsed an idea Democrats had long championed and Republicans had long opposed: having the federal government negotiate prices directly with drugmakers, just like the governments of other developed countries do. Name-brand drugs in those countries are far less expensive than they are in the U.S.  A year and a half into his presidency, and following some well-publicized meetings with precisely the sort of pharmaceutical industry leaders he once denounced, Trump has backed away from that rhetoric. He’s no longer calling to have the federal government negotiate with drugmakers over prices and, more generally, he no longer identifies the drug industry as the primary culprit behind high prices. Instead, Trump has adopted a more nuanced and in many ways more traditionally Republican argument for why prescriptions are so expensive. This view, which the White House Council of Economic Advisers laid out in a February report, blames high prices more on the excesses of big government than on the excesses of Big Pharma.  According to this argument, government insurance programs make drugs unnecessarily expensive. An example is the requirement that Medicare Part D plans ― the private insurance policies that provide seniors with prescription coverage ― include at least two drugs from each class. If the insurers who provide those plans could have just one drug from each class, administration officials say, insurers would have more negotiating leverage and could cover drugs more cheaply. Another issue is the way Medicare pays for drugs that specialty physicians, such as oncologists, deliver on an outpatient basis. Trump administration officials say this payment scheme gives the doctors incentive to provide the most highly priced therapies when cheaper drugs might be just as good, if not better, on a clinical basis. Trump is expected to call for restructuring those payments, in order to reduce that incentive. The administration has some other changes in mind, too. It wants to straighten out a complicated scheme of rebates and payments among insurance companies, drugmakers and a group of middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. PBMs have received a great deal of scrutiny in recent years, because their payment arrangements are secret.  In theory, they are supposed to help insurers bargain for lower prices, which can then benefit consumers. In practice, critics say, PBMs strike deals that drive up their own profits without providing much relief for the people who get drugs. The precise details of how the administration plans to address these and other issues remain unclear, even in the blueprint. Absent more information, it’s impossible to know how aggressive the administration intends to be ― or what could be done through regulatory action, which the administration can handle on its own, versus legislation, which would require Congress to act. But the break with campaign rhetoric is clear and, in this respect, Trump’s approach to prescription drugs has a lot in common with the approach he has taken toward the insurance reforms of the Affordable Care Act. As a candidate, Trump promised to replace “Obamacare” with a more generous, more comprehensive universal coverage scheme. At several points, he suggested he might just push for a European-style, single-payer system in which the government would simply insure everybody. “Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now,” he said shortly after taking office. Once in office, Trump abandoned such promises. The repeal bills he tried to pass would have downsized existing government programs and stripped away regulations designed to make sure everybody can get decent coverage, regardless of pre-existing condition. Had one of those bills become law, millions of people would have lost coverage. A common theme in the Obamacare repeal episode and, now, the effort on drug prices is Trump’s willingness to outsource policymaking to the GOP establishment, which remains loyal and sympathetic to the big corporations Trump attacked as a candidate.  Still, there are some critical differences as well.  With the repeal fight, Trump was largely outsourcing to congressional leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). They promoted extremely conservative ideas, including structural changes to Medicaid that would have dramatically reduced its funding. At times, they seemed more focused on getting a bill ― any bill ― through Congress than attempting to construct a workable alternative for helping people to get insurance. On prescription drugs, it appears Trump has largely turned policymaking over to a few key figures in his administration, chiefly Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Both are bona fide conservatives and have ties to the drug industry. Azar is a former Eli Lilly executive.  But in an administration full of ideological zeal and sometimes questionable competence, Gottlieb and now Azar have reputations for smarts, savvy and a serious commitment to governing. Gottlieb in particular has earned praise, even from Democrats, for the way he has managed the agency. And so perhaps it is not surprising that at least some of the ideas they have put on the president’s agenda enjoy a great deal of support from across the political spectrum. These days, it’s difficult to find anybody who understands health policy who’s willing to defend current PBM practices. And those changes to reimbursement for cancer and other specialty drugs? The Obama administration tried to do something similar. The administration also says it will seek to change the design of the Part D benefits, in ways that could make specialty drugs more affordable for the people who desperately need them but struggle to pay for them.  Each of these ideas comes with its own costs and potential dangers. Take the idea of changing the requirements on which drugs Part D plans cover, reducing the number from two to one in each class of treatment. The theory is that with two drugs, many people will take the more expensive one when they don’t need it. But if there’s just one, it could be harder for people who need a different drug to get one. (Think of somebody who needs a particular psychiatric drug in order to avoid certain side effects.) There is one element of the administration’s drug strategy that has a distinctly Trumpian tinge to it: criticism of other countries.  The administration argues that drug companies charge Americans more because, in other countries with price controls, they have to charge less. In this view, those other countries are basically getting a free ride, because American consumers are subsidizing the research and development that leads to breakthroughs. Trump says he will address that problem by somehow getting other countries to pay more of their fair share. Presumably, this would entail making drug prices, already a subject of trade negotiations, an even bigger priority, though it’s not clear how much leverage the U.S. has. Also, most economists doubt the prices that drug companies can get abroad have much, if anything, to do with the prices they charge here.  What’s not on the table are any of the big, potentially game-changing ideas like having the government negotiate directly with drugmakers, or allowing imports of cheap drugs from other countries, or radically redesigning the patent system (which some economists believe is both the source of high prices in this country and the easiest way to bring them down).  There are reasons for this. Conservatives like Azar and Gottlieb say such measures would cause more harm than good ― stifling innovation, limiting choices and ultimately depriving people of medicine they need.  Lots of reasonable people agree with that view, or at least worry about the possible effects of the government meddling with prices. The economics of pharmaceuticals, like health care policy generally, is complicated and full of trade-offs.  But the contrast with what Trump promised as a candidate could not be more stark.

The 7 Problems With Our Phones,"The dark truth is that it’s become very hard to find anyone (and certainly anything) more interesting than one’s smartphone. This perplexing and troubling realization has for most of us had huge consequences for our love stories, family lives, work, leisure time and health.This is a text that aims to bring a little sanity to our closest, most intense and possibly most danger-laden technological relationship. 1. Addiction To say we are addicted to our phones is not merely to point out that we use them a lot. It signals a darker notion: that we use them to keep our own selves at bay. Because of our phones, we may find ourselves incapable of sitting alone in a room with our own thoughts floating freely in our own heads, daring to wander into the past and the future, allowing ourselves to feel pain, desire, regret and excitement. We are addicted to our phones not because we rely on them, but to the extent that we recruit them to a harmful project of self-avoidance. 2. Our phones and our relationships In principle, we love family life and are very keen on and devoted to relationships. But, obviously, the reality is tricky. The wonderful things are mixed up with a lot that is awkward and frustrating. Our partner isn’t quite as sympathetic as we’d ideally like; our family is more conflicted and challenging than feels fair or reasonable. Our phone, however, is docile, responsive to our touch, always ready to spring to life and willing to do whatever we want. Its malleability provides the perfect excuse for disengagement from the trickier aspects of other people. It’s so tempting to press the screen when one’s partner launches into an account of their day or their theory of ideal fridge management. The details of their existence and their hopes for our shared domestic life cannot compete with information about the most expensive apartment currently on sale in Manhattan or the diet of Mymains Stewart Gilligan (the largest pet cat in the world). 3. Dating  We can, it seems, hook up so easily. There are millions of people out there. It shouldn’t be hard to find the right one – if only we sign up to the right site. We become monsters of our hopes: any person we have met is judged against those we haven’t ever met. Of course, none of the people we do meet through our phones is in fact ever quite right. So we go back to the search and redouble our efforts. The task of love can’t be to locate some mythical ‘right person’. Compatibility is an achievement of love, it can’t be its precondition. This is a truth that our phone, as yet, doesn’t want to teach us. It promises to locate someone who likes eating cheese, wants to wear a rubber mask and lives within a ten mile radius of Sevenoaks. But it cannot, as yet, help us with the real challenge of love: which is to extend sympathy and understanding to human frailty. 4. Appreciation Our phones seem to deliver the world directly to us. Yet (without our noticing) they often limit the things we actually pay attention to. As we look down towards our palms we don’t realize we are forgetting: They are all waiting for a little attention. 5. Fear Of Missing Out  Thanks to our phone we’re more exposed than ever to the alluring things others do: ‘there was this great bar we all went to …’; ‘she’s getting married in a little country church…’;  the top after-party … amazing views … chic Brooklyn bar that locals love…’ There is so much we’re not doing, not invited to, not part of. Our own lives, it naturally seems, are filled with the Fear Of Missing Out. It’s tempting to get a bit cynical. Maybe the hyped things are not all they’re cracked up to be? It’s more nuanced than this: we do indeed risk missing out. But there is a rather different list of things we might not get round to enjoying than the one our phones want us to focus on: getting to truly know our parents, learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; chatting to a seven year old child… It’s not the notion of missing out that is the problem. It’s our ideas of what we might be missing out on that counts – and that our phones unhelpfully skew. 6. The Dream of being ‘liked’ It can feel desperately naive or narcissistic to admit it – but we really like being ‘liked.’ Our momentary excitement when we get a message isn’t shameful or ridiculous. It’s a widely shared, yet secret, pang of hope: that our troubles and joys will be truly understood by another; and that all the messages we wish to send to the world would be received and perfectly understood, at least by someone. We should not be frightened or discomfited by our pervasive loneliness. It isn’t our fault: a degree of distance and mutual incomprehension isn’t a sign that life has gone wrong. It’s what we should expect from the very start. In any case, loneliness makes us more capable of true intimacy if ever better opportunities do come along. It heightens the conversations we have with ourselves, it gives us a character. We don’t repeat what everyone else thinks. We develop a point of view. We might be isolated for now, but we’ll be capable of far closer, more interesting bonds with anyone we do eventually locate. Loneliness is simply a price we may have to pay for holding on to a sincere, ambitious view of what companionship must and could be. 7. Selfies The problem with selfies is not that we take them, but that we don’t take them seriously enough. We tend to feel the need to be a touch ironic: ‘Here I am eating a sausage!’ ‘Look at me with this cute hat!’  Yet selfies are not inherently silly or self-regarding. They sit in one of the grand traditions of high art: the self-portrait. Although he was hampered by having to use oil paint and brushes, Rembrandt was addicted to making images of himself (more than one hundred across his long career). But he never showed himself winking or making funny hand gestures. Instead he was looking closely at who he was and what he had become: contemplating the sadness that gradually accumulated in his own face, trying to work out what he really made of being alive: what has life done to me? What have I done with my time on earth? He wasn’t seeking the approval of others, he was seeking self-knowledge. When something (like taking selfies) seems a little trivial or silly, it’s tempting to think we should take it less seriously; we should distance ourselves from it and see it in a mocking light. But the wiser move might be to get much more ambitious. The art of a selfie may have a long way to go yet. We are still so far from inventing the technology we really require for us to flourish. We deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times.   If you like our articles, visit our website.",TECH,TECH
How Some Rich People Are Trying To Dismantle Inequality,"By Erynn Beaton, The Ohio State University; Maureen A. Scully, University of Massachusetts Boston;  and Sandra Rothenberg, Rochester Institute of Technology Ample research indicates that the growing problem of wealth and income inequality could stunt U.S. economic growth and undermine our democracy while stirring political polarization. Given that the federal government shows little interest in fighting economic inequality and many states are ill-equipped to do much about it, what else can be done? Studies have also found that the rich exert far more influence over government than the rest of us. This imbalance means that wealthy people who do something about inequality may have more power to make an impact than everybody else. As scholars of social change, we wanted to learn more about how a small number of affluent Americans choose to spend their own time, clout and money fighting inequality. The latest official estimates indicate that the richest 10 percent held 76 percent of the nation’s wealth as of 2013. That means for every US$10, these Americans own $7.60, leaving $2.40 for the remaining 90 percent. And the concentration of wealth is only getting worse. The richest 10 percent held only 67 percent of the nation’s wealth in 1989. Growing inequality is inspiring some rich people to do something about it by influencing public policy and corporations. For example, Morris Pearl, previously the managing director of investment firm Blackrock, has lobbied to close the carried interest tax loophole, which many financial managers use to significantly lower the income taxes they pay. Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of Chobani Yogurt, gave his employees an ownership stake in the company prior to its sale, even though he could have made more himself if he had not. Businessman T.J. Zlotnitsky offers another apt example of this demographic. After making a fortune with his tech company, he wants companies to pay higher wages and the government to tax the rich more. Zlotnitsky belongs to Patriotic Millionaires, a group of rich people bent on fighting inequality. As he explained in a blog post:  To learn more about people like him, we conducted interviews with 20 people who live across the country and belong to a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a more fair economy. (We agreed not to name it.) All of the people we spoke with consider themselves to be “wealthy allies” who work alongside people of much more modest means to reduce economic inequality. These rich people epitomized wealth in America: most were white men. They spanned all ages. Some had inherited their fortune, while others were raised in households with modest means and made their wealth over the course of their careers.  Like Zlotnitsky, most wealthy people fighting inequality who we spoke with told us they had gone through a reflective process to recognize the advantages their status has afforded them while getting involved in this effort. First, they accepted that they partly owed their wealth to a system that works in their favor and not merely to their own merits and efforts. Realizing that they owe their wealth partially to systematic advantages and luck was challenging because it requires overcoming the popular belief that people get what they deserve. Chuck Collins, who inherited and gave away his share of the Oscar Mayer fortune, told a tale of self-awareness in a memoir he called “Born on Third Base.” Collins now advocates for preserving the estate tax and does research on inequality to bring more attention to the issue.  The next step is overcoming shame. Acknowledging their privilege made many of the people we interviewed feel ashamed. For example, a bisexual woman who inherited nearly $1 million on her 21st birthday said she found it harder to come out to her friends as wealthy than as a lesbian. Hearing over and over that identifying as rich was disconcerting surprised us because many Americans claim their wealth as evidence of merit. In addition to overcoming their guilt and shame, wealthy allies often fear the ire of other rich people. Their peers got mad at them for doing things that arguably violate their own economic interests, such as advocating for taxes targeting the rich.  The people we interviewed all said they consider these challenges hard but necessary parts of the process of becoming a wealthy ally. Many said they relied on people like themselves for moral support. Most of the rich people who try to do something about inequality give some of their money away. Yet philanthropy isn’t an ideal tool for fixing inequality, as research by economists like Indraneel Dasgupta and Ravi Kanbur has shown. The rich people we interviewed who wanted to side with the poor seemed to think about philanthropy differently than their peers. All donated at least some of their wealth, and some have given their entire fortunes away. But most of them also tried to go further by lobbying Congress to raise taxes on the rich or urging corporate boards to raise worker pay – two potential ways to reduce inequality. Some of the people we interviewed said they believed that they had found another path to make their philanthropy more effective. For example, one man admitted to himself that he might not be the best person to determine where his money should be spent. After years of giving money to charities started and run by upper-middle-class men like himself, he began giving to organizations that were started and led by the poor. In this way, he handed over his elite power to the poor, trusting that they knew better how to raise themselves up than he did. As this example demonstrates, acting as a wealthy ally to dismantle economic inequality requires a paradigm shift. Wealthy allies said they believed that the most effective way for them to fight inequality is by willingly handing over their power to the poor. This shift can make it uncomfortable for rich people to join the movement to fight inequality. But if their efforts help preserve our democracy and our economy, it may be worth it.

Trump And Kim Jong Un Likely To Meet Next Month In Singapore,"President Donald Trump will likely meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore next month, according to several media reports. Both CNN and Fox News, citing people familiar with the plans, said officials have been told to begin preparations for the summit after Trump ruled out the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula as a possible location. The White House has confirmed that a date and site have been set, but the announcement has not been made publicly. Trump said he would reveal the details in three days. “I can tell you that a date and location are set, but, beyond that, I don’t have any other announcements at this point,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday. Kim expressed support for the summit in a statement given to North Korean state television on Wednesday, saying the event would be a “historic meeting” and a first step toward the “building of a good future” on the Korean Peninsula. The news comes shortly after newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Pyongyang to meet with Kim and finalize details of the meeting. During the Wednesday visit, Pompeo secured the release of three American prisoners that had been held in North Korea. The U.S. had long demanded that North Korea free the men, Kim Dong-chul, Kim Hak-song and Tony Kim, who had been held on charges of espionage and “hostile acts.” “I’m thrilled that we have them back,” Pompeo told reporters, according to The New York Times. “President Trump set conditions for this to happen, and I am thrilled with that.” The secretary also appeared optimistic about the summit, telling Kim at a lunch in Pyongyang that he was “hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve.” The three former prisoners are scheduled to arrive at Joint Base Andrews, outside Washington, D.C., at 2 a.m. Thursday and will be met by the president. All are reportedly healthy and able to walk on their own. “I will be there to greet them,” Trump tweeted. “Very exciting!” Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.",POLITICS,POLITICS
Two Words: Driverless Boats,"Remote-controlled ships could hit the high seas within a decade. While they might end up putting sailors out of a job, fully autonomous boats could help the fossil fuel-hungry shipping industry drastically slash its carbon emissions. Staffing a ship with a full crew requires lots of energy. Sailors need food, water, onboard sewage treatment facilities, air conditioning and heating. They also add weight to the vessel, slowing it down. Without a crew on board, a cargo ship could run on 10 to 15 percent less fuel and cut its carbon emissions by a similar percentage, according to Oskar Levander, vice president for innovation at Rolls Royce, which is developing autonomous ships with researchers at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. “The primary benefits of remote and autonomous vessels will be improved efficiency and safety,” Levander told the blog Climate Home. “Obviously anything that makes ships more efficient in terms of energy consumption also has the potential to reduce emissions.”  The first driverless boats were developed by the United States Navy and tested in 2014. The Navy designed its fleet of remote-controlled ""swarm boats"" to carry out risky missions without a crew, keeping sailors away from the line of fire.  Driverless cargo ships, by contrast, would be responsible mostly for steaming across the ocean, docking, loading or unloading cargo, then steaming on to the next port. And Rolls Royce says its researchers are perfecting the technologies needed to remotely steer ships through the high seas. Shipping goods by sea accounts for between 2 and 3 percent of global carbon emissions -- equivalent to the annual carbon output of Germany. That number could jump to 14 percent by 2050, according to Bill Hemmings, aviation and shipping policy director at Transport and Environment, a group advocating for sustainable industry policies.  The quickening pace of global economic growth is driving the rise in shipping emissions. During the 2008 recession, global trade slowed to a crawl, and ships literally cut their speeds to conserve fuel. Now, as the economy rebounds, cargo ships are completing voyages faster and more frequently, increasing their carbon output, said Hemmings. ""The easiest way to make a ship more efficient is to slow down,"" Hemmings told The Huffington Post. ""What we all fear is when the economy picks up, average ship speeds are going to pick up and emissions will skyrocket again."" Pollutants emitted by cargo ships, along with emissions from the aviation industry, have been a bone of contention during international climate negotiations. At the December climate talks in Paris, 196 countries pledged to reduce their carbon emissions in a bid to keep planetary warming under two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but the deal didn't include the shipping or aviation sectors.  By leaving those two industries out of the agreement, countries have made it much harder to meet the agreed-upon warming targets.  ""If shipping and aviation don’t start reducing, these two sectors are going to gobble up whats left of the carbon budget,"" Hemmings added.  For large cargo ships, cutting carbon emissions can be tough. Most ships still rely on bunker fuel, the heaviest, dirtiest fuel on the market. Some military vessels run on nuclear power, but it's too risky for commercial boats. Ships could potentially run on lower-carbon ethanol or hydrogen fuel cells, but companies have so far shown little interest in switching. So, shipping companies and researchers are experimenting with ways to make fossil fuel-powered vessels more efficient, said Hemmings. In an effort to cut the amount of fuel ships needs to complete their journey, they're testing high-tech sails, streamlined hulls and ""bulbous bows,"" which reduce drag as ships slice through the water.  Rolls Royce's remote-controlled ship is only the latest in a string of efforts to improve ship efficiency. It remains to be seen how well it actually works.  ""Whether autonomous ships will be significant, I don’t know,"" Hemmings said.  Airplanes are already highly automated. But there's little evidence that taking humans out of the cockpit would do much to cut carbon emissions. Most attempts to clean up the aviation industry have involved swapping jet fuel for cleaner alternatives. Researchers have also developed fully electric and hybrid-electric airplanes, including planes that run exclusively on solar power.  The shifting regulatory landscape could give remote-controlled ships a boost. Until this year, cargo ships didn't have to report how much fuel they used. Companies that wanted to hire efficient ships weren't able to charter those vessels simply because they didn't know how much fuel each ship burned, according to Hemmings. That changed in April, when the International Maritime Organization adopted a measure requiring ships weighing more than 5,000 metric tons to report how much fuel they use. The new reporting rules could help countries and shipping companies demand that ships clean up their act, according to Hemmings. ""Once we’ve measured fuel burn of ships, then maybe we could have an efficiency standard,"" Hemming said. ""If you have autonomous ships that are efficient, they would fare well under that regime.""",TECH,BUSINESS
The Most Important Climate Pacts You've Never Heard Of,"From Climate Central's Andrew Freedman: With global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions stalled, cutting short-lived climate pollutants has emerged as an unsung story of U.S.-led progress in the international climate arena. Momentum has quietly been building toward a series of agreements that, when combined, could make a significant dent in the amount of manmade warming that occurs during the next several decades. The recent pacts, two of which were reached in St. Petersburg, Russia on September 6, concern global warming pollutants that have a far shorter atmospheric lifespan than carbon dioxide (CO2), a single molecule of which can linger in the air for more than a century. In contrast, emissions of black carbon, or soot, last just days to a couple of weeks before being washed out of the atmosphere. But those emissions exert a strong warming influence both when they are airborne and after landing on bright surfaces such as snow and ice. Other short-lived climate pollutants — including tropospheric ozone, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) — linger in the atmosphere for several years to about a decade. Some short-lived climate pollutants are helping to melt snow and ice in the Himalayas and the Arctic, altering the timing and characteristics of the South Asian Monsoon season, as well as contributing to millions of premature deaths each year due to air pollution. Those pollutants have a lower public profile than carbon dioxide, the main culprit in long-term manmade climate change, and consequently, diplomatic efforts to curb short-lived emissions have not been the focal point of most discussions.  While there has been gridlock trying to craft a new global climate treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol, which mainly concerns carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, there has been a flurry of activity concerning short-lived pollutants that recent studies have shown play a surprisingly large role in warming the planet. The recent progress on short-lived pollutants both reflects the frustration leaders have with the U.N. climate talks, and a newfound determination to go after the low-hanging fruit to advance climate policies through innovative diplomatic approaches. If they are successfully implemented, the new agreements could give a much-needed shot in the arm to the U.N. climate treaty process.  For more information on the methods behind this interactive, click here. Reducing emissions of the short-lived pollutants offers the chance to slow global warming in the near-term while diplomats continue the arduous process of negotiating a longer-term climate treaty, since carbon emissions cuts will be required to limit long-term warming and its myriad effects regardless of how steep any cuts to short-lived pollutants are. Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in Washington, said that for the past 18 years, countries have focused on making progress on climate change through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, but that approach has changed. “We’ve said everything’s got to be done through this monolithic, one approach. And guess what? It hasn’t worked.” Zaelke said. “The world has simply found other ways to get started (to address manmade global warming).” Recent studies have shown that cutting emissions of short-lived climate pollutants could avoid up to 1.1°F of additional global warming by 2050. Those emissions reductions also could lessen some global warming-related hazards, such as sea level rise, during the next few decades. According to a study published this year in the journal Nature Climate Change, reducing emissions of a portfolio of short-lived climate pollutants, including soot and methane in addition to HFCs, by 30 to 60 percent by 2050 would slow the annual rate of sea level rise by about 18 percent by 2050. Combining reductions in short-lived pollutants with decreasing CO2 emissions could cut the rate of sea level rise in half by 2100, from 0.82 inches to 0.43 inches per year, while reducing the total sea level rise by 31 percent during the same period, the study found. The most recent agreements on short-lived climate pollutants have been the biggest climate diplomacy victories yet for the Obama administration, which has placed a high priority on advancing greenhouse gas emissions reductions through multiple avenues outside of the U.N. The administration's international efforts mirror the situation domestically, where staunch resistance to action in Congress has forced the White House to use administrative means, mainly through the EPA, to implement its climate policies. U.S.-China Agree to Cut HFCs Meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg on September 6, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a bilateral agreement to begin working to phase down the production and use of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, a treaty negotiated in 1987 to address the destruction of the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. The treaty is considered to be one of the most effective international environmental treaties to date, with every country in the world having committed to binding reductions in emissions of substances that deplete stratospheric ozone. Since the treaty entered into force, the ozone layer has been steadily recovering, although a seasonal “ozone hole” still appears each spring over Antarctica. An unintended consequence of the Montreal Protocol was that it led to the creation and use of HFCs as a non-ozone destroying substitute for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were strictly limited and subsequently banned by the treaty. While HFCs do not harm ozone, they do contribute to global warming. Some types of HFCs are so potent that scientists call them “super greenhouse gases.” HFCs are used as substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals in refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial applications. With the phase out of CFCs, the use of HFCs has been increasing in recent years, particularly in developing countries such as China and India. According to Zaelke’s group, a phase down of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol could prevent the equivalent of up to 8.8 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year by 2050, with a cumulative total of prevented emissions of between 76 to 134 billion tons of CO2-equivalent. Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at NASA, said in an email that avoiding the projected explosive growth in HFC use alone could forestall up to 0.2°F of warming by 2050, and up to 0.9°F by 2100. For the past four years, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have introduced an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to reduce the use and production of HFCs, but there has not been enough support to pass them. Now that China has agreed to take action on HFCs, environmental advocates hope that other major developing nations that have opposed the amendments, particularly India and Brazil, will follow suit. The leaders of both nations are scheduled to meet with President Obama at the White House during the next two months, and HFCs are likely to be on the agenda, said Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. Light said that taking action now on short-lived pollutants is necessary since even if a new U.N. treaty were to be successfully negotiated in 2015, it wouldn’t go into effect until 2020 at the earliest. That delay would threaten the goal of limiting climate change to less than a 3.6°F global temperature increase compared to preindustrial levels, which was agreed to by world leaders in 2009. The world has already seen about 1.6°F temperature increase since 1901, according to a forthcoming report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The cooperation between the U.S. and China on HFCs is also significant because the two countries, which together account for the majority of the world’s carbon emissions, are the biggest players in the U.N. climate talks. “It goes without saying that if the U.S. and China can’t cooperate (on a mitigation plan), then there just won’t be a global mitigation plan,” Light said. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee who plans to introduce legislation to address domestic emissions of short-lived pollutants, praised the U.S.-China deal. ""The fact that China has now endorsed phasing down HFCs under the Montreal Protocol is something few of us would have even thought possible just a few short months ago. But thanks to strong leadership from the President and Secretary of State, it’s a reality,"" Murphy said in a statement. ""This is an enormous step forward, and one we need to capitalize on in Bangkok next month,"" when the parties to the Montreal Protocol meet next. G-20 endorsement; voluntary initiatives launched In addition to the bilateral agreement the U.S. reached with China, on Sept. 6 the G-20 nations also endorsed taking action on HFCs through the Montreal Protocol, while reaffirming their commitment to the U.N. climate treaty process to address CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases. Those agreements were largely overlooked by the media as news of Syria dominated worldwide attention.. There has also been unprecedented progress within another new international forum geared specifically toward cutting emissions of short-lived climate pollutants. Created in February 2012, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollution now has 33 member nations plus the European Commission, as well as numerous non-governmental organizations. The group has about $60 million in funds to sponsor projects that would address near-term climate change and air quality, such as promoting the use of cleaner-burning cookstoves in the developing world and promoting the use of cleaner diesel engines, both of which are sources of black carbon emissions. While some critics have argued that the newfound focus on short-lived pollutants may distract attention from the task of cutting carbon emissions, the White House, along with outside observers, dismiss such concerns. What is needed, they say, is progress along any avenue possible at this point, given the dire state of U.N. treaty talks ever since world leaders failed to produce a new climate treaty at a summit in Copenhagen in 2009. “I don’t think this is a distraction. I think the U.S. and other countries see daylight” here that they don’t see within U.N. climate talks, Light said.  ""Climate change is a complex issue, and one that will require the U.S. government to walk and chew gum at the same time. We can pursue action on HFCs under the Montreal Protocol while simultaneously pushing for a strong agreement from the UNFCCC,"" Murphy said, referring to the U.N. climate talks. ""Not all climate pollutants were created equal, and it behooves us as responsible policymakers to move fast in reducing short-lived climate pollutants.""",ENVIRONMENT,ENVIRONMENT
Pranksters Rename Mexico's Congress As 'Chamber of Rats' On Google Maps,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Pranksters changed the name of Mexico’s lower house of Congress to the “Chamber of Rats” on Google Maps on Tuesday in the latest dig at the political class during a testing start to the year for the country’s government. The lower house, also known as the Chamber of Deputies, became the “Chamber of Rats”, using the Spanish word “rata,” which is also slang for thief in Mexico. “Our teams are working fast to resolve this incident,” Google Mexico said in a statement, explaining that place names on the online mapping service came from third parties, public sources and contributions from users. It was the second such attack in the space of a few days. Mexican media reported at the weekend that the presidential residence appeared as the “Official Residence of Corruption” on Google Maps before Google Mexico removed it from the map and apologized for “inappropriate content” created by a user. Mexico’s government has faced protests, road blocks and looting of shops since the start of 2017, when the cost of fuel jumped sharply on the back of a finance ministry decision to liberalize the market and end state-set gasoline prices. Allegations of corruption swirl constantly around the political class in Mexico. A 2013 Transparency International study showed that 91 percent of respondents felt political parties were corrupt or extremely corrupt. Some 83 percent took the same view of the legislature, the study showed. The credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto was damaged by a conflict-of-interest row earlier in his six-year term when it emerged that he, his wife, and his then-finance minister had all acquired homes from government contractors. A government-ordered probe cleared all of any wrongdoing. (Reporting by Dave Graham; Editing by Bill Rigby)",TECH,TECH
Shoppers Boycott Publix Over Store's Donations To NRA-Backed Candidate,"Some Florida shoppers are vowing to boycott grocery store Publix ahead of the busy Memorial Day weekend after the regional chain donated more than a half-million dollars to a gubernatorial candidate who touts himself as a “proud NRA sellout.” Earlier this month, local media first revealed the grocer’s $670,000 in donations over the last three years to Republican candidate Adam Putnam, Florida’s current agriculture commissioner. Putnam, who brands himself as a lifelong gun owner, opposed Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) gun control law signed in the wake of February’s deadly mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school. Putnam had said Scott’s decision to raise the age to purchase a rifle or a shotgun from 18 to 21 “destroys the family tradition of possessing and practicing safe use of firearms.” The National Rifle Association, which immediately sued to block the gun law, applauded Putnam’s stance. Publix is Florida’s largest private employer, according to The Tampa Bay Times, and its political donations to Putnam are likely some of the largest since 1995, if not in the company’s history.  Now the #BoycottPublix petition has spread across social media. No, @Publix. Just, no. As long as you're using the money I spend to support @adamputnam for Florida governor, you have lost my business. #BoycottPublix Add me to the list of people who will #BoycottPublix. I hate the idea that even a penny I've spent at @Publix has gone to @adamputnam. There will be no more money from me. Not even a penny. So @Publix wont let you have ""Summa Cum Laude"" on a cake, but I bet a picture of a gun would have been perfectly fine.#BoycottPublix #NRAsellout https://t.co/wbEfcPa4qi Hey @Publix...made the switch today!  Will not set foot in your store again until stance on Putnam changes!  He is bad for Florida and our Everglades! #tweetthereceipt #BoycottPublix pic.twitter.com/Vqev8Eavhq Publix defended itself, saying it never made any direct donations to the NRA, which has called for more guns in the wake of what many are calling a gun violence epidemic. Including last week’s deadly shooting at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school, there have been 16 school shootings this year, according to a count by The Washington Post. Publix said in a statement to HuffPost Tuesday evening that the company has a “history of supporting candidates focused on job growth and a healthy Florida economy.” “We regret that some of our political contributions have led to an unintentional customer divide instead of our desire to support a growing economy in Florida,” the company said. “As a result of this situation, we are evaluating our processes to ensure that our giving better reflects our intended desire to support a strong economy and a healthy community.” Those vowing to boycott Publix have argued that supporting Putnam directly supports the NRA because of his promise to uphold the group’s beliefs. “I’m very sad I’ll never experience the joy of a [Publix sub] again but nothing tastes as good as being on the right side of the fight,” tweeted social media user Gabriella Juliet, who used the boycott hashtag. Whether the boycott will affect the company ― which has 1,183 stores in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia ― remains to be seen. According to personal finance website WalletHub, 60 percent of Americans plan to barbecue over the Memorial Day weekend, with $1.5 billion worth of meat and seafood being purchased for the event. Memorial Day is also the second most popular day for beer sales, just behind Independence Day. David Jenkins, a Tampa resident who said he is participating in the boycott, estimated to the Times that he spends $500 to $600 a month at Publix stores. He said he’s now taking his business to competitor Winn-Dixie. “I’m sure if you went through every corporate chain you could find something you disagree with, but there’s a certain point where you draw a line,” he told the paper. “This situation — where the amount of money is so substantial and the stakes so high — is the line.” Publix has financially supported Putnam as a political candidate since at least 1995, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Publix has explained its support for Putnam as him being a “hometown candidate” from Polk County, where the company was founded, and having “a long-standing relationship” with the grocer. The Times reported that in 2016, during his second term as commissioner of agriculture, Putnam once pulled the results of failed health inspections of seven Publix stores from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’s website. He then eliminated the pass/fail grading system and made it so the worst rating possible is “re-inspection required.” Florida’s primary elections are on Aug. 28. The state’s gubernatorial election is on Nov. 6. Putnam’s challengers include U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. The Democratic candidates are former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, and Central Florida businessman Chris King. This article has been updated to include a statement from Publix.",POLITICS,BUSINESS

"Facebook Pays Kid $10,000 For Discovering Major Instagram Bug","A 10-year-old discovered a bug on Instagram that could have ruined the entire platform, and his reward was a paltry $10,000 from Facebook. We know what you're thinking: $10,000 is a lot of money! Indeed it is. But Instagram is said to be worth many billions of dollars (about $56 billion, according to our math using current revenue projections). All estimates aside, Facebook acquired it for $1 billion in 2012 -- the service is worth a lot of money. The Finnish 10-year-old, identified only as Jani in the VentureBeat report about his discovery, is said to have found a glitch on Instagram that allowed him to delete any comment left on the social platform. Rather than harnessing his newfound superpower to rule Insta with an iron fist, he alerted Facebook officials, who patched up the glitch. VentureBeat said Facebook confirmed the story -- originally published in a Finnish newspaper -- but a representative for the social network did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post. We'd like to assert that Jani is owed more money. His reward would only pay for a bit less than 30 percent of one year of private college education in the United States. And if he had posted the exploit to, say, Reddit rather than going to Facebook, the damage to innocents who generate revenue from amateur photos of brunch and puppies may have been unspeakable -- brand #engagement could have plummeted! In fairness, the reward was more than the $4,457.14 average paid to security researchers who reported bugs to Facebook last year. But come on: Facebook and Instagram are among the most widely used, important online services in the entire world. We respect Jani for keeping them safe for all, but maybe he could have gotten a little more out of the exchange -- maybe $1 per monthly user who could have been affected by the glitch? For a total of $400 million or so? Seems fair to us.",TECH,TECH
Science And Sense In A Post-Truth World: How Do We Know?,"In my work and my world, I am dealing routinely with whiplash-inducing headlines about health, and nutrition in particular (“no, wait, fruits and vegetables are bad for us this week!”)  that raise questions about science, sense, and knowledge. When whatever  we think we know, however reliably we think we know it, is called into  question so routinely, it begs the question: how do we know?  My question is not how do we know any given thing, but rather - how  do we know anything, ever, at all? The surprising answer is, we do  not. Not unless we decide to trust our nervous systems and the  perceptions they engender, for which there is a compelling case. We do not, truly, know anything because all we can do is  perceive. Were we in a virtual reality, like the one portrayed in the  science fiction classic, The Matrix, we would likely be unable  to know it, or prove it. We cannot disprove it now, either, since all of  our perceptions of all of our disproofs would take place in the same  virtual reality, reinforce it, and do nothing to tell us it wasn’t real. We really can’t know anything for sure. But we can choose to have  faith in the veracity of our impressions here, and build knowledge from  them. If our perceptions are reliable, then what we derive from them is  reliable, and so, too, are the embellishments of science, which are,  essentially, extensions of our native perceptions via instruments and  assays, lenses and equations.  It makes sense that our nervous systems and perceptions would be  reliable since they are the ones we have here, wherever here is, and  thus they are the ones adapted to be here. They are the perceptions that  help us survive in this place where we are surviving.  We can, in effect, choose to have faith in our perceptions, and build  our understanding from that foundation. The only alternative is to  renounce the reliability of the only reality we know, and never  understand anything. Most of us have made the choice long ago, if rather  unconsciously. What an intriguing, if ironic opportunity for bridge-building to  concede that the origins of science reside in faith. Not faith in  supernatural forces; faith in ourselves, faith in our perceptions, faith  in our capacity to know- but faith, just the same. Knowledge and  knowing do not begin with science, but with our faith in the reliability  of constant or consistent patterns we perceive in the world around  us. Knowing begins with our senses, and the common sense to trust them. Science, then, extends those perceptions, dispels the denser shadows,  reveals the hidden. But there is nothing an electron microscope or the  Hubble telescope could show us that would remedy lack of trust in our  native capacity to see. Science expands the realm of what we can know,  only because knowing is possible in the first place, based on patterns  we perceive in the world around us. The more constant the patterns, the  more reliable- or even certain- our knowledge. We know for certain that our reality is not THE reality, of  course. We cannot, for instance, see infrared, or ultraviolet; but we  know those wavelengths exist. To see the lesser rainbow bounded by our  frail, human vision is to concede that what we “see” is not all there is  to see, just our portion of it.  The same limits pertain to our other  senses. We do not hear ultrasound, but know it exists. We know that  solid objects are made up of far more empty space than substance, yet- solid they seem to our fingertips, themselves more empty space than otherwise. Science is not possible without faith in our perceptions, yet science  itself tells us how limited those unaided perceptions are. Knowing  within our sliver of reality, therefore, comes naturally; all the rest  is rather harder. How we know is of practical importance to us every day, for science  is being abused. The science of climate change is abused by deniers of  the long established and increasingly obvious, an indictment succinctly  and elegantly made recently by one of our premier scientists,  astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. The  science of nutrition and health is abused every time a new round of  headlines tell us everything we knew most reliably until yesterday, such  as the general benefits of eating vegetables and fruits and legumes, is  wrong again. We did not suspect, we knew that apples fell down, not up from their  trees before Newton. Had Newton’s calculations said otherwise, Newton’s  formulas and not the apples would have been wrong. So, too, we know that  a passing fixation on lectins  does nothing to alter the established benefits of routine consumption  of vegetables, fruits, and legumes; nor does a study overlooking the encompassing influence of social factors and environmental circumstance on health.  In this post-truth era, we seem to have forgotten, or at least allow  ourselves to be mislead routinely about, what science is for.  Science is where knowledge extends, not where it begins. How  interesting, with regard to diet, that every wild species on the planet  knows what to feed itself, while owning no science at all. Our species  presumably knew how to feed itself, too, until it started misapplying  science to propagate doubt and perpetuate confusion. Science is a method, a set of tools, and the most powerful we know,  for answering hard questions that do not yield to casual observation and  common experience. It is not for refuting what we know reliably and  decisively on the basis of those humbler methods. Science cannot tell us  that apples fall up out of trees, or that fire puts out water- for  these are established as false where knowledge begins, in the realm of  our native perceptions. Science is for enhancing knowledge. It can find for us previously  unknown things about lectins, and explore for us the idiosyncrasies of  electrical fires. The reliability, verifiability, falsifiability, and  replicablity of science are to be celebrated by all of us living in a modern world awash in its endowments.  But science simply isn’t for unknowing what was constant and clear  before ever science was applied to it. We know that apples fall down  from their trees and will continue to know that, no matter what new  truths are teased out of gravity. We know, as well, that eating apples is good for us this week, as it was last. The science of logic tells us something can be necessary but not  sufficient, like any one enzyme in a biochemical pathway, or any one  station in an assembly line. Common observation tells us something can  be sufficient but not necessary, like any one route to a destination  when others are at hand, or any one specific diet on a common theme fostering vitality and longevity. Science, for all its independent marvels, depends on sense. Science  is a powerful tool, and like any other power tool, can be used well or  badly. For it to foster understanding rather than constant confusion in  this age of alternative and competing “truths” on every important topic,  we need to use it more sensibly. -fin This column follows a talk I was privileged to give recently to  students in a Theory of Knowledge course at the Cheshire Academy taught  by Mr. Chip Boyd. My thanks to Mr. Boyd, and his students, for the  provocation!  David L.

The Case For Sharing All Of America's Data On Mosquitoes,"By Ed Yong For decades, agencies around the United States have been collecting data on mosquitoes. Biologists set traps, dissect captured insects, and identify which species they belong to. They’ve done this for millions of mosquitoes, creating an unprecedented trove of information — easily one of the biggest long-term attempts to monitor any group of animals, if not the very biggest. The problem, according to Micaela Elvira Martinez from Princeton University and Samuel Rund from the University of Notre Dame, is that this treasure trove of data isn’t all in the same place, and only a small fraction of it is public. The rest is inaccessible, hoarded by local mosquito-control agencies around the country. Currently, these agencies can use their data to check if their attempts to curtail mosquito populations are working. Are they doing enough to remove stagnant water, for example? Do they need to spray pesticides? But if they shared their findings, Martinez and Rund say that scientists could do much more. They could better understand the ecology of these insects, predict the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever or Zika, coordinate control efforts across states and counties, and quickly spot the arrival of new invasive species. RELATED: How the Rise of Cities Helped Mosquitoes Thrive That’s why Martinez and Rund are now calling for the creation of a national database of mosquito records that anyone can access. “There’s a huge amount of taxpayer investment and human effort that goes into setting traps, checking them weekly, dissecting all those mosquitoes under a microscope, and tabulating the data,” says Martinez. “It would be a big bang for our buck to collate all that data and make it available.” Martinez is a disease modeler — someone who uses real-world data to build simulations that reveal how infections rise, spread and fall. She typically works with childhood diseases like measles and polio, where researchers are almost spoiled for data. Physicians are legally bound to report any cases, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiles and publishes this information as a weekly report. The same applies to cases of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika, but not to populations of the insects themselves. So, during last year’s Zika epidemic, when Martinez wanted to study the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the disease, she had a tough time. “I was really surprised that I couldn’t find data on Aedes aegypti numbers,” she says. Her colleagues explained that scientists use climate variables like temperature and humidity to predict where mosquitoes are going to be abundant. That seemed ludicrous to her, especially since organizations collect information on the actual insects. It’s just that no one ever gathers those figures together. RELATED: Shazam for Mosquitoes Together with Rund and a team of undergraduate students, she found that there are more than 1,000 separate agencies in the United States that collect mosquito data — at least one in every county or jurisdiction. Only 152 agencies make their data publicly available in some way. The team collated everything they could find since 2009, and ended up with information about more than 15 million mosquitoes. Imagine what they’d have if all the datasets were open, especially since some go back decades. A few mosquito-related databases do exist, but none are quite right. ArboNET, which is managed by the CDC and state health departments, mainly stores data about mosquito-borne diseases, and whatever information it has on the insects themselves isn’t precise enough in either time or space to be useful for modeling. MosquitoNET, which was developed by the CDC, does track mosquitoes, but “it’s a completely closed system, and hardly anyone has access to it,” says Rund. The Smithsonian Institution’s VectorMap is better in that it’s accessible, “but it lacks any real-time data from the continental United States,” says Rund. “When I checked a few months ago, it had just one record of Aedes aegypti since 2013.” “That’s why we came up with this idea of a national surveillance system,” Martinez says. “The U.S. government should make it a requirement for mosquito-control boards to send in their data.” RELATED: The Quest to Make a Better Mosquito Repellent Some scientists who work on mosquito control apparently disagree, and negative reviews have stopped Martinez and Rund from publishing their ideas in prominent academic journals. (For now, they’ve uploaded a paper describing their vision to the preprint repository bioRxiv.) “Some control boards say: What if people want to sue us because we’re showing that they have mosquito vectors near their homes, or if their house prices go down?” says Martinez. “And one mosquito-control scientist told me that no one should be able to work with mosquito data unless they’ve gone out and trapped mosquitoes themselves.” Other scientists aren’t convinced that collating the data would be useful. “To predict an outbreak, a national database would be of no use,” says Lyle Petersen, who directs the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. “Mosquito density is very, very local. Knowing what’s going on with mosquitoes in California isn’t going to help you with what’s going on in Illinois. The data from even one part of a city may be totally irrelevant to another.” Micah Hahn, an epidemiologist at the University of Alaska Anchorage, feels differently. She says that a national mosquito database “would be extremely useful for public health-planning and emergency response”—but creating one would be a logistical nightmare. “There are hundreds to thousands of independently operating vector-control units — some not more than a guy and truck in rural areas — with varying levels of human resources and computer savvy,” she says. They vary in which traps and baits they use, whether they count males as well as females, and whether they identify insects down to the species or genus. Merging such disparate data would be hard, and there’s no quality-control system in place for checking it. Roxanne Connelly, an entomologist at the University of Florida, agrees. “As a researcher, I’d love to have access to a nation-wide mosquito surveillance database and have often wished for such a system in Florida,” she says. But after 17 years of experience, she thinks that “trying to standardize the data, for the past or in for future, is going to be almost impossible.” Martinez agrees that this is the biggest obstacle to creating the database of her dreams — but she doesn’t see it as a deal-breaker. She and Rund argue that many states have already taken steps toward building open databases. Iowa, for example, makes all its mosquito data freely available. “At a minimum we are advocating for stringing these systems together,” they say. “Data should be made available without having to justify exactly what’s going to be done with it,” Martinez says. “We should put it out there for scientists to start unlocking it. I think there are a ton of biologists who will come up with cool things to do.” This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.

"Sen. Dean Heller’s Campaign Paid His Social Media Influencer Son More Than $50,000","Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller’s campaign has paid his son, a social media influencer, more than $50,000 since July 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. The payments to Harris Heller and his company, Heller Enterprises, were mostly for social media consulting, but they also include small reimbursements for travel and lodging. The Heller campaign said Harris Heller’s work for the campaign includes running their Instagram page – which has 1,337 followers – and making videos for Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The Nevada senator is considered the most vulnerable Republican running for re-election in 2018. A first-term Republican running in a state narrowly won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, he is expected to face Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in November. Paying family members with campaign funds is legal, as long as they aren’t paid more than market rate for the work and the work is for bona fide campaign services. But ethics experts have flagged the practice as problematic. It’s ensnared members of Congress from both parties, including GOP Reps. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Stephen King (Iowa) and Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush (Ill.). “A candidate or office-holder contracting with a family member raises questions about personal use of campaign money,” said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. “If a candidate can use donor money to fund the lifestyle of themselves or their family members, the risk of corruption goes up.”  Harris Heller isn’t a social media neophyte. He describes himself as “Musician/social media influencer” on his LinkedIn page, declaring: “If I’m not playing guitar, snapchatting or streaming on Twitch you should probably call the police.” He and his wife, the singer Kenzie Nimmo, have hundreds of thousands of followers on their YouTube accounts and were popular on Vine before Twitter shut down the latter service. They’ve appeared on The View and in ads for Gap, Coca-Cola and HP.   The Heller campaign defended the hire, saying the younger Heller produced most of the video content for the campaign’s social media accounts, shooting hundreds of hours of video. He has also started the campaign’s Instagram account and provides story-telling expertise that traditional campaign digital consultants lack. “Harris Heller produces quality content at a cheap discount to the campaign. He creates social and digital media for Fortune 500 companies,” spokesman Keith Schipper said. “He is an important part of our team, and we are lucky to have him.” The spokesperson said Harris Heller has produced 28 videos, including spots pushing the campaign’s tax reform message and showing his father’s extensive travels around the state.  The younger Heller has a YouTube page that went inactive in June 2017. Most of the videos on the page have between 1,000 and 3,000 views, although some have substantially more. One video, titled “I’m Doing a Nude Scene in Grey’s Anatomy,” has 16,000 views. Other popular videos include “Recording in Justin Bieber’s Studio” and “TOP 8 HIDDEN TRICKS IN POKEMON GO.” The payments to Harris Heller began in July 2016 and have continued into 2018. On its most recent FEC report, the campaign said Harris Heller earned two payments totaling $10,000 in February and a $2,500 payment in March. (The campaign said Harris Heller is paid $2,500 a month, although those payments are sometimes delayed.)  In the past, campaign finance reform advocates and ethics groups have called the practice “legally alright but morally kind of sticky.” Before his retirement, former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) introduced legislation seeking to ban the practice. It attracted no co-sponsors, and never saw the Senate floor.",POLITICS,POLITICS
"More Toxic Chemicals Damaging Children's Brains, New Study Warns","The number of industrial chemicals, heavy metals and pesticides proven capable of derailing normal brain development -- and robbing children and society of dollars, IQ points and future potential -- has doubled over the last several years, according to a new paper published Friday.  Dr. Philippe Grandjean, one of the co-authors, suggested that the world is facing a ""silent pandemic"" of ""chemical brain drain.""  ""We have an ethical duty to protect the next generation,"" he said. ""In particular, the next generation’s brains."" As a medical student in the 1970s, Grandjean remembers watching a young Japanese teenager, Shinobu Sakamoto, on the TV news. Sakamoto struggled to walk and talk, but was determined to let the world know about her people's plight. Many in her fishing village of Minamata had unknowingly consumed seafood heavily tainted with methylmercury. Her mom had done so while Sakamoto was in her womb. ""I was shocked, as they didn't teach us anything about the effects of pollution on human health"" in medical school, recalled Grandjean, chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark and an adjunct professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""That was the moment I decided to do something about it."" Grandjean has spent the decades since investigating chemicals capable of damaging the developing brain. He started with lead, then mercury. ""Every time I turned over a stone, I found something new,"" he said. The line-up has now grown to a dozen ""bona fide brain drainers,"" said Grandjean. That's twice as many chemicals as he and co-author Philip Landrigan, chairman of the department of preventative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, listed in their first review of the science in 2006. Joining methylmercury, lead, arsenic, PCBs, toluene and ethanol, according to the authors' updated list, are manganese, fluoride, DDT, chlorpyrifos, tetrachloroethylene and polybrominated biphenyl ethers.  The consequences of exposure in the womb or during the first years of life to any of these heavy metals, pesticides, solvents, flame retardants and other industrial compounds may not always be as obvious as they were for Sakamoto. But the effects on society, experts warn, can be profound. An estimated one in six children in the U.S. is now affected by a cognitive or behavioral disorder, and that rate appears to be on the rise. Experts suggest that increases in the number of kids with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for example, can't be explained by increased awareness or surveillance alone. Environmental pollutants are among the suspects. Still, the new paper's concerns go much further. Reduce one child's IQ by five points and the difference may be imperceptible. The child might be just a little slower to learn, a little shorter of attention and a little less successful on tests and at work -- which economists estimate could equate to $90,000 in lost lifetime earnings. Reduce the average IQ among all children in the U.S. by five points, however, and the impact is striking: About half as many members of that generation will be ""intellectually gifted,"" twice as many will be ""intellectually impaired,"" and billions of dollars of productivity will be lost. And that doesn't take into account the costs of diagnosis, treatment, special education, incarceration and other indirect costs, such as an estimated rise in traffic accidents attributed to more distracted drivers. A potential shifting of the bell curve should ring alarms for policymakers, business leaders and parents alike, experts say. They add that the current list of chemical culprits likely represents just the tip of the iceberg. ""The number is going to increase. Right now, it's just a matter of not having data available,"" said David Bellinger, an expert in children's environmental health at Harvard, who has found associations between three of the brain poisons -- lead, methylmercury and organophosphate pesticides (a class that includes the newly added chlorpyrifos) -- and drops in the combined nationwide IQ of 23 million, 17 million and 0.3 million points, respectively. Adding to the problem, Bellinger added, is that ""the regulatory process in this country is inherently conservative: You have to prove something is bad [before you can ban it] rather than prove something is good [before you can authorize it]."" Representatives of the chemical industry, meanwhile, called the new paper ""flawed."" ""The authors focus largely on chemicals and heavy metals that are well understood to be inappropriate for children's exposure, highly regulated and/or are restricted or being phased out,"" the American Chemistry Council told HuffPost in an emailed statement. ""They then extrapolate that similar conclusions should be applied to chemicals that are more widely used in consumer products without evidence to support their claims."" The industry group further emphasized that its members ""go to great lengths to ensure products are safe.""
 
Most of today's knowledge about chemicals and their effects on the human brain is based on the study of adults -- typically those who have suffered occupational exposures or tried to kill themselves. With these data, scientists have tallied a total of 214 neurotoxic chemicals. Another thousand chemicals have been shown to be toxic to animals' brains, while thousands more have yet to be studied for neurotoxicity.   Science has come a long way since Grandjean’s medical school days, when his professors taught that the fetus is well protected inside the mother’s womb. Scientists now know that hundreds of chemicals can course through umbilical cord blood. But proving that a specific chemical can harm a child's growing gray matter is extremely difficult and time-consuming, which experts suggest is why the list currently stands at only 12. ""The default assumption is that if it's not good for the adult brain, it's even worse for the child's,"" said Bellinger. Timing is critical. At certain times while the baby is still inside the womb, brain cells are added at a rate of 250,000 every minute -- with each neuron migrating to a specific location in the brain, where it begins building intricate networks with other cells. During the first few years of a baby's life, 700 new neural connections are formed every second.   ""The brain has to go through very complicated and delicate stages of development that have to happen at the right time and in the right sequence. If that doesn't happen, you don't get a second chance,"" said Grandjean, who has recently published a book on the topic titled Only One Chance. ""That kid is stuck with that brain the rest of his or her life,"" Grandjean added. Some children may be more at risk than others, noted Bruce Lanphear, an environmental health expert at Simon Frasier University in British Columbia. ""If you grow up in an impoverished neighborhood, you could be exposed to lead, airborne pollutants, tobacco smoke and high levels of pesticides,"" he said. ""Each of these can chip away at learning abilities or elevate risks of ADHD."" What's more, some of these chemicals may magnify the effects of others. Lead, for example, has been shown to cause more harm in children who are also exposed to tobacco smoke or manganese. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a pediatric environmental health expert at Seattle Children's Hospital, noted at least a few things that parents and expecting parents can do to reduce potential neurotoxic exposures inside their home. She recommended avoiding fish known to contain high levels of mercury, such as tuna, as well as minimizing dust, removing shoes when coming indoors and keeping windowsills clean.  She also welcomed the paper's recommendation of a new agency -- much like the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer -- that could coordinate research and grade the evidence for a chemical's propensity to wreak havoc on the developing brain. Some progress has already been made, including the newly adopted Minamata Convention on Mercury, which addresses human activities contributing to widespread mercury pollution and was inspired by the tragedy in Sakamoto's village. But, as Grandjean noted, even chemicals long-banned in the U.S., such as chlorpyrifos, are still turning up inside American homes or being exported to developing countries. ""This is like climate change,"" he said. ""We just can’t afford to do this experiment. Once we finally get enough evidence, it's too late."" Grandjean added his fear of a potentially ironic ""vicious cycle."" ""If the next generation does not have the cognitive skills that we hope they will have,"" said Grandjean, ""they will not be able to clean up after us ... or care for us."" ",ENVIRONMENT,SCIENCE
